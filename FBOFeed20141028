<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground-Belvoir Division, on behalf of Project Manager Expeditionary Energy and Sustainment Systems (E2S2) intends to negotiate with Cummins Power Generation, Inc., 1400 73rd Ave NE, Minneapolis, MN on a sole source basis to procure Advance Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) Generators, in 5kW, 10kW, 15kW, 30kW and 60kW sizes, operating in the 50/60Hz or 400 Hz mode for a period of performance of seventeen (17) months.  AMMPS supports the specialized tactical power generation needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and its components, which require unique, non-commercial features such as the use of Jet Propulsion fuel, type 8 (JP-8) fuel and operability in extreme environmental conditions.  <br>  <br> The resulting contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  It has been determined the Cummins Power Generation, Inc. is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only one Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Cummins Power Generation was the incumbent manufacturer of AMMPS under contract number W15P7T-04-D-A003.  This contract was awarded using full and open competition on 29 September 2004 for a developmental effort and production ordering periods.  The contract expired 28 September 2014.  Currently there is no Government contract that provides for the continued need for military-specification generator sets in the 5kW to 60kW sizes and there are no known commercial generators that can meet the Government's need.  Delivery of these units is required to begin within 3-6 months from contract award.  Cummins Power Generation is the only source that has produced the required sets, passed necessary First Article Testing requirements, and has all the necessary special fabrication tools to meet the Governments requirement and schedule.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  All proposals received within 15 days will be considered by the Government.  Responses shall be no longer than ten (10) pages and shall be in a Microsoft word compatible format.

<DESC>THIS ORIGINAL MARKET SURVEY WAS POSTED ON THE FAA'S CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WEBSITE (FAACO.FAA.GOV).  IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, THE INFORMATION MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION.

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Governments understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units.

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and ten (10) production units of each subassembly.

The attached (DRAFT) Statement of Work (SOW) describes the following subassemblies of the Mode S primary power amplifier:

       *Driver amplifier substrate assembly (replacement for Westinghouse part number 1D21879G01)
       *Output amplifier substrate assembly (replacement for Westinghouse part number 1D21881G01)

The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Business; or open it up for full and open competition.  All interested sources need to respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted screening process when the RFO is issued.  Decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.

BACKGROUND

The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the (DRAFT) Statement of Work.  

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey.   

The intent of this market survey is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to meet requirements to manufacture Form-Fit-Function replacements for the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. Qualified vendors will need to show capability to furnish all required labor, plant, materials, fixtures, equipment, tools, test equipment, technical data/expertise and all other facilities necessary to provide Form-Fit-Function replacements for the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly.

RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:

Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

Interested sources should provide evidence of qualifications/capabilities available to provide experienced qualified management and technical personnel to manufacture Form-Fit-Function replacements for the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly.

The accompanying documents are intended to provide enough information for prospective companies/vendors to decide whether or not they are capable of providing Driver and Output Amplifier Assemblies that meet the Mode S systems requirements.  Interested vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture Driver and Output Amplifier Assemblies that meet the Mode S systems requirements should provide sufficient information to describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can produce Driver and Output Amplifier Assemblies meeting the size, electrical (reflected power, output power (minimum and maximum), rise time, ability to tune the input and output matching circuit, etc. under specified test conditions), and military standards specified in the accompanying documents.  In addition, the submitted documentation should address the following:

     *Vendors ability to provide two (2) each First Article Driver and Output Amplifier Assemblies within four (4) months after receipt of order. 
     *Vendors ability to commence delivery of production Driver and Output Amplifier Assemblies within three (3) months of the FAAs notice to proceed.

Response submittals must include information for the following two (2) requests:

1.  Vendor responses will describe the resources available to meet the description set forth in this market survey and provide documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is qualified and capable manufacture Form-Fit-Function replacements for the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly.  Documentation shall include ability to meet delivery requirements.  The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor.  A short list of RF projects that the vendor has successfully designed and manufactured (emphasis on high power, high frequency RF amplification) can be submitted to demonstrate the capabilities that the vendor possesses in this area. 

2.  Completed and signed Business Declaration Form (attached) for descriptive information regarding the business status of the vendor.

All response submittals (one response per company) are to be provided with a cover letter on company letterhead.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 P.M, local time November 12, 2014.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Becton, Dickinson and Company, 2350 Qume Dr., San Jose, CA, 95131-1812 to provide maintenance to the Flow Cytometry Core's BD FACSAria II Special Cell Sorter System.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>Maintenance Services for the following equipment:</p>
<p>1. FACSAria II Special, Serial Number: P650033024<br />2. Laser Red Coherent Cube 637-150 <br />3. Svc Cont SAPPHIRE 200 MW Blue laser<br />4. Svc Cont Laser Violet 405-100<br />5. Svc Lightwave XCYTE 60mw UV laser<br />6. Svc Cont SORP Coherent Sapphire 532-200</p>

<p><br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.<br /><br />The purview of our research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.<br />DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders.<br /><br />The mission of the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is to provide state of the art cell analysis using flow cytometry. It is necessary for the ongoing research in cardiology, hematology, and lung diseases.<br /><br />For the optimal results in identifying cell populations determined by using lasers, and the highly complex and sensitive electronics of the BD FACSAria for cell sorting, a maintenance contract must be in place to have specially trained engineers for service and routine timely maintenance to ensure the least amount of downtime of the cell sorter. A maintenance contract must provide phone service and prompt service calls by highly qualified engineers, to maximize the uptime and productivity for uninterrupted service to the Institute<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />This acquisition is for the purpose of procuring a multi-year maintenance agreement for the Flow Cytometry Core's BD FACSAria II Special Cell Sorter System.</p>

The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to award delivery orders under Basic Ordering Agreement Number N00024-12-G-4329, on an other than full and open competition basis, to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Post-Interim support for the LCS 1 and LCS 3.
 Efforts will include execution and advance planning of Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAV), Continuous Maintenance (CM), Emergent Maintenance (EM), Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Planning and Execution, Facilities Maintenance (FM), Administration and Engineering Support Services (AESS), and class planning and support services. These delivery orders will bridge the gap between interim support services, currently being performed under contracts N00024-03-C-2311 and N00024-09-C-2303, and the competitive award of a Product Support Plan (PSP) contract.  As the shipbuilder of the LCS 1 variant, LM MS2 is the only known source with extensive previous experience necessary to perform these efforts and has developed unique and technical expertise for the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of these ships.
  LM MS2 is the only known source capable of providing coverage in order to prevent possible disruption in services and unacceptable delays in mission critical efforts necessary to restore or maintain the ship to a fully operational level required to support the Fleet.

The statutory authority for the sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The procurement will be for an estimated minimum dollar amount of $100,000 and a maximum estimated dollar amount of $7,379,936 over the five year ordering period. The requirement is for spares of the Linear Photonics assembly parts to include P/Ns: 77A126686P4 Module, Dual TX FIB, 77A126686P9 Fan Module, AD 77A126686P7 Module, Controller, 77A126686P5 Module, Quad RX FIB, 77A126686P8, Module Power Supply, and 77A126686P6 Module, Fan. .FOB destination delivery will be 8-20 weeks after receipt of order at NSWC Crane, Crane, IN.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with Cranesmart Systems Inc for crane components for the Dredge McFarland.  This requirement is for the replacement of the control system for two (2) 10 ton cranes on the Dredge McFarland.

It is imperative that the new system components be manufactured to fit and mount in the same exact location as the original equipment.  All mounting of the new equipment shall mimic the mounting configuration of the removed existing equipment in order to facilitate a trouble free installation by members of the McFarland's Ship Crew. The McFarland's 10 ton cranes were designed and built by Allied Systems specifically for the unique application associated with the vessel that is mounted post/starboard on a rotating turntable that sits mid-ship.  Allied incorporated Cranesmart Engineering and Controls into the original design and construction. The only control system that can be installed as a direct replacement is the Cranesmart Control System.  It is the only brand that can operate the existing cranes without some type of extensive modification and/or redesign of the complete installation. This notice of intent is NOT a Request for Competitive Proposals.  No contract award will be made on the basis of this notice. This notice does not constitute a solicitation document. Requests for such documents will not be considered. However, all information received within three (3) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<h4>Contracting Office Address:<br /><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Life Cycle Management Center, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7228</h4>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the procurement of Satellite Tool Kit (STK) software license renewal for The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).</p>
<p>NASIC analysts utilize STK software to provide an intuitive view of complex mission and orbit geometries in a physics based 2-D and 3-D space analysis and visualization environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This powerful tool has proven to be integral to the work of NASIC's analysts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This software is used on UNIX and Windows based computers (NASIC's Cornerstone network architecture is UNIX-based).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The STK software allows NASIC branches to analyze and visualize signal data received from other intelligence organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STK software has the essential tools to help NASIC analyze the performance and characteristics of aircraft and spacecraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STK allows analysts to animate and evaluate objects in real or simulated time with preloaded or imported terrain, atmosphere and space data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The software is capable of limiting geometric, terrain, RF, radar and EO/IR models to measure behaviors against objective dynamic displays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STK also interoperates with standard tools and data from MATLAB, ESRI, and KML.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STK software will augment the process of analyzing complex space scenarios and determining optimal solutions with the ability to present results in graphical and text formats for easy interpretations and analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Providing on-site technical support and classified telephone support, as needed, will ensure NASIC analysts know how to effectively employ STK software and produce expedited intelligence products.<br /><br />The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a twelve-month license. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.<br /><br />All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to <a href="mailto:Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil">Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil</a>. Statements should be submitted no later than 12 Nov 2014, by 12 NOON E.T. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil">Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil</a>.<br /><br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you have any questions, you may contact Adam Smith at <a href="mailto:Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil">Adam.Smith.71@us.af.mil</a>.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Center (RDECOM-NSRDEC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information on methods to develop a Static Line Automatic Activation Device (SLAAD) for use with static line parachute systems. The system must be capable of automatically activating the reserve parachute of a paratrooper that is unable to activate the reserve on their own under a partial or total malfunction of his/her main canopy. The desired characteristics for such a system (not in priority order) are as follows: (1) functions on current and future static line parachute systems including the current the T-11 and MC-6 parachute systems with the common T11-R reserve parachute. (2) operates onboard high performance, fixed wing, rotary wing, and non standard aircraft at speeds from 70 to 150 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), (3) accurately determines exit and separation from the aircraft prior to executing the reserve deployment, (4) must operate from exit altitudes of 600 ft above ground level or higher (threshold) and 525 ft above ground level or higher (objective), (5) must not interfere or influence any existing equipment with the exception of the reserve canopy and container, (6) must not interfere or influence any existing equipment associated with the jump platform, including aircraft avionics communications or any other electrical or mechanical systems, (7) demonstrate probability of successful activation providing that the system will not inadvertently activate (e.g., onboard the aircraft, during a towed jumper event, during jump master procedures, or under a full-open main canopy), (8) system must allow for the ability to manually deploy reserve canopy without changing current procedures, (9) system will have  quote mark black box quote mark  capability to store critical data of each jump that may be accessed by the user, (10) system will have a 12.5 year usable life to coincide with parachute expected life. (11) cost for the system is less than $800 (threshold), $500 (objective). Expected fielding numbers for systems will be determined when requirements are finalized.  Above noted characteristics are top level desired characteristics additional attributes may be communicated at request for proposal.  Confidence and reliability numbers will be established as the program advances.   <br>  <br> The science and technology effort in the area of applied research and experimental development being considered is on the order of $1.5-$4M through FY15-20.

<DESC>The United States Government (USG) Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) is seeking sources for the production of the Modernized Day Sensor Assembly (M-DSA) Phase 2 Lot 1 and Dual Mode Laser Spot Tracker with Training Laser Designator (DMLST) upgrade kits on the AH 64 Apache helicopter.  The M-DSA laser is integral to Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS) and must be able to interface with existing unmodified equipment.  The M-DSA must also be capable of providing commands to control existing sub-systems.  Interfacing with original equipment manufacturer equipment and systems is critical to maintain proper operation of the AH-64 Apache helicopter, particularly because the M-TADS/PNVS operates on a flight-stabilized servo gimbal.  Extremely small tolerances in mass, balance, electromagnetic interference, optical properties, and manufacturing techniques must be carefully controlled within the system to ensure performance.  The first unit equipped including design, assembly, integration, test, qualification and first article test must be fieldable in twenty-four months after contract award. <br>  <br> USG-ACC-RSA seeks qualified vendors to provide design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risk, product descriptions, support requirements, reliability data including Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Additionally, USG-ACC-RSA is seeking sources with a strong background, history and/or past performance in streamlining and facilitating rapid acquisition, addressing obsolescence, enhancing USG-contractor interactions, and containing cost with comprehensive cost controls.  The vendor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to accomplish production, test, packing, preservation, packaging, and return to the USG in a completely serviceable/like new condition.  The vendor will be responsible for recurring and nonrecurring engineering services associated with becoming a qualified source, and for supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues, and delivery of serviceable/like new assets.  Responders shall provide their product's Technology Readiness Level (TRL) number and back it with evidentiary data.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiated evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above. <br>  <br> All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest, qualifications, and technical concepts to Ms. Mona Lisa Brown, Contracting Officer via e-mail at monalisa.brown2.civ@mail.mil.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the USG to procure any items, nor does the USG intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  Suspense is 15 days after the release date of this sources sought.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) in Bethesda, Maryland has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process. This work comprises two sub-domains: 1) develop systematic, data-driven analytic tools using existing SSA data to inform disability determination processes; and 2) develop Computer Adaptive Tests (CAT) that can be integrated into the SSA disability determination processes to comprehensively and consistently assess claimant function. These efforts are highly technical from an analytic and computing perspective; they also have significant policy implications in light of the size and scope of SSA's disability programs. NIH-RMD's proposals for improving the disability determination process are generated by ground-breaking science conducted by a highly skilled and innovative interdisciplinary team and disability policy experts. However, these solutions are useful only to the extent that they can be implemented successfully. To this end, NIH-RMD seeks the support of a technical consultant with detailed knowledge of social insurance issues, existing disability programs, the policy and business environment at SSA, the execution of demonstration projects, and the current legislative landscape to support NIH-RMD program leaders in developing practical, targeted proposals that can address problems of central importance to the SSA disability determination process.</p>
<p>The NIH-RMD seeks a contractor who will leverage their existing knowledge of social insurance issues and disability programs to perform tasks in three broad categories:</p>
<p>1) Propose creative solutions and alternatives to address potential barriers to conducting SSA related projects and operationalizing proposed innovations, including assistance in developing strategic partnerships and obtaining resources;<br />2) Suggest ways to test analytic and functional tools within and outside the SSA environment and propose methods to evaluate impact of these tools after implementation; and,<br />3) Identify fruitful areas for future analytic efforts to improve the SSA disability determination process based on existing SSA processes and emerging issues relevant to disability determination and outcomes.</p>
<p>The contractor will also be expected to assist in drafting materials, including project reports and briefing materials and/or testimony for Government forums related to the SSA project, and to propose methods and strategies for analyzing and developing quantitatively driven policy options in the areas of disability, work incentives, means-tested and health insurance programs.</p>
<p>Contractors proposing to fulfill this requirement must have extensive knowledge of all aspects of the U.S. social security disability programs. Knowledge of emerging issues relevant to disability determination and outcomes must be evident and the ability to foster partnerships to optimize SSA project outcomes must be demonstrated. In addition, contractors must demonstrate a breadth and depth of experience in improving program efficiencies using analytically and technologically driven tools; building effective coalitions; and planning and implementing large Federal demonstration projects. The ability to provide expert technical consultation on complex policy and programmatic issues is critical.</p>
<p>The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in the areas described above. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm.</p>
<p>The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".</p>
<p>Vendors must send written capability responses by November 12, 2014, 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to Lisa Schaupp, the Contract Specialist at the e-mail address Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov. For any questions regarding the response submission process, please respond in writing to the email address provided.</p>

<p>NAICS Code: 531190-Leasing of Building Space to Federal Government by Owners</p>
<p>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2014 to November 07, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks, and Chester counties in Pennsylvania; Camden, Burlington, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey; and New Castle County in Delaware.  <br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Center for Delivery Organization and Markets (CDOM), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with SK&amp;A Information Services, Inc. of 2601 Main Street, Suite 650 Irvine, California 92614 for census data on office-based physician practices owned by integrated health systems.<br />

<p>This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. Period of Performance shall be for 12 months.</p>
<p>AHRQ seeks to improve the efficiency and value of U.S. health care by understanding how high performing health systems diffuse evidence-based medicine into practice to improve outcomes and reduce costs. AHRQ requires data to conduct intramural research to identify, characterize types of delivery systems and to compare the performance (quality and resource use) across delivery systems.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide measurement and linkages for the census of office-based physician practices, hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies owned by integrated health systems in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, including individual physician National Provider Identifier (NPI) linkages to integrated health system names.

Database records must be verified by phone at least twice per year. The data shall include current year and historical records from at least December 31, 2010. The data shall include linkages from integrated health system names to: 1) specific physician practices identifiable by physician name, physical address and NPI; and 2) specific hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, accountable care organizations, and integrated health systems identifiable by company name, physical address and type of facility (ie, size).  The contractor shall provide regular updates to the data on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>SK&amp;A Information Services is the only known source that offers phone-verified data on the census of office-based physicians with linkages from National Provider Identifier (NPI) to integrated health system name, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and accountable care organizations. As a result, SK&amp;A Information Services is uniquely qualified to provide high quality data on the demographics of physician practices owned by integrated health systems. For the aforementioned reasons, SK&amp;A Information Services is the only known source for this procurement.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, any interested party may submit information or inquiries.

<DESC>Military Sealift Command- Washington, DC (MSC-DC) intends to issue a modification under N00033-14-D-8017 with Tridentis, LLC to increase the maximum quantity of the Contract under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items at 41 U.S.C. 1901, on or about 30 October 2014. The Contract provides support in the development of specifications and drawings necessary to accomplish the Extended Service Life Program (ESLP) scope of work for the USS MOUNT WHITNEY. The contract increase is required because of an underestimation of the support required to execute the ESLP. Once work began on the project, the Government identified the need for a higher level of support than was initially anticipated. Accordingly, an increase to this Contract is required.<br /><br />Tridentis, LLC is currently providing the services that will be required under task orders issued as a result of this modification. It is not practicable to acquire these efforts from a different source. Tridentis has extensive knowledge of the vessel and the ESLP due to the completion of multiple task orders, including lengthy detailed shipchecks, under the subject contract. The duplication of costs in having another contractor obtain the amount of knowledge and experience that Tridentis possesses would be very high and would result in unacceptable delays. In addition, the task orders issued under the contract are interrelated such that it is in the best interest of the Government to have the work performed by a single company.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330 with the size standard of $35.5 million. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within 2 calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by MSC. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address lisa.bouchelle@navy.mil. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is not a solicitation. This is not a request for quote (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), request for application (RFA), or an announcement of a solicitation; nor does it assume the Government will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitation types in the near future. The responses requested herein are for information purposes only and do not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be initiated, issued or awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this Notice, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to it or to any related follow-up requests. All information considered proprietary must be marked accordingly by the submitter. The Government will not be held liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for, any improperly identified proprietary information. Properly identified proprietary information submitted in response to this Notice will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations. The sole purpose of this announcement is to gather information from the marketplace regarding the capability of small businesses to provide the services and products summarized herein. None of the responses received will be considered an offer, nor can they be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this Notice will not be returned. No telephone inquiries will be accepted and no requests for solicitation packages will be granted, since no solicitation has been prepared at this time.<br /><br /><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) is conducting market research with the concurrent goal of obtaining capability statements from small business concerns that are interested in maintaining, operating and upgrading two (2) ground stations that will track, demodulate, and locate distress signals emitted by 406 to 406.1 MHz Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) beacons, Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) and Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs), and relayed through bent pipe repeaters on board Global Positioning Satellites and other Mid Earth Orbiting satellites. The ground stations are located at the U.S. Coast Guard Communication Station (USCG COMMSTA) Miami facility located in Miami, Florida and the USCG COMMSTA Honolulu facility located in Wahiawa, Hawaii. All data will be relayed to the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) located within NOAA's National Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland.
<p>Responses are being sought only from small business concerns at this time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code associated with this Notice is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing, which has a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 750 employees. NOAA will use the information it collects as current market data that could contribute to the planning of possible future procurements, and for the purpose of evaluating the potential of small business concerns to provide the described goods and services. All submitted materials will be designated "For Government Use Only" and NOAA reserves the right to contact respondents for clarification and discussion of the submitted responses.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The U.S. SARSAT program is currently managed by NOAA and operated in partnership with the U.S. Air Force (USAF), USCG, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The SARSAT program has operated within the framework of the International Cospas-Sarsat program since 1982, and has been credited with saving over 36,000 lives through the use of satellites to detect and relay distress signals to ground stations called Local User Terminals (LUTs). These LUTs track Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting (GEO) satellites equipped with instrumentation that detects distress signals and then relays those distress signals to the USMCC for location processing and rescue coordination purposes. With the advent of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as the United States' GPS, the Russian Federation's Glonass and the European Union's Galileo operating in a Mid Earth Orbit (MEO), the International Cospas-Sarsat program has members who have implemented and successfully tested ground systems that are capable of interoperating with these MEO satellites. These new MEO Search and Rescue (MEOSAR) ground systems are called MEOLUTs and operate in conjunction with the existing network of LEO and GEO ground systems. Until global coverage for distress detection and processing can be accomplished by a worldwide system of MEOLUTs, these two U.S.-based MEOLUTs will continue to be maintained and operated in parallel with the existing LEOLUTs and GEOLUTs. The two U.S.-based MEOLUTs currently provide a distress alert coverage area that encompasses all of the U.S. Areas of SAR Responsibility, as outlined by the National Search and Rescue (National SAR) plan.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION REQUESTED:</strong> Accordingly, NOAA is exploring the availability and capability of small business concerns to provide maintenance and operations support along with possible engineering support that would be needed to incorporate the U.S.-based MEOLUTs into the International MEOSAR System concept of operations, should such a requirement arise. Interested companies should describe their capabilities in relation to the activities listed below:</p>
<p><em>System Description</em></p>
<p>The NOAA MEOLUTs must:</p>
<p>&bull; Detect, characterize, and locate 406 to 406.1 MHz emergency beacons and transmit associated data to USMCC;</p>
<p>&bull; Be capable of receiving S-Band and L-Band downlinks from GNSS satellites that are equipped with a 406 to 406.1 MHz SAR repeater;</p>
<p>&bull; Measure both the frequency of arrival and time of arrival of detected beacon signals and use the results to accurately locate the beacon;</p>
<p>&bull; Calculate an unambiguous location for the beacon if the message is received from at least three GNSS satellites for a given burst;</p>
<p>&bull; Be capable of improving the location accuracy of the distress beacon over the first burst detection by combining subsequent bursts received by at least three satellites.</p>
<p><em>Beacons</em></p>
<p>The functions of the NOAA MEOLUTs include:</p>
<p>&bull; Receiving and processing signals transmitted by 406 to 406.1 MHz emergency distress beacons</p>
<p>&bull; Locating interfering signals that can prevent successful reception of 406 to 406.1 MHz emergency distress beacons and sending the locations of the interfering signals to the USMCC.</p>
<p><em>Ground Segment</em></p>
<p>This aspect of a small business concern's capabilities involves the analysis and maintenance of the two U.S.-based MEOLUTs and the infrastructure required to support their antennas' power and communication lines (i.e. from the NOAA MEOLUT processors, located in their respective USCG COMMSTA buildings, to the local antenna field).</p>
<p><em>Operational Requirements</em></p>
<p>The MEOLUTs must be fully operational, meaning a minimum of four (of the six) antennas at each site being operational at least 99 percent of the time, as calculated twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week over a year with less than two (2) percent total downtime calculated over that year;</p>
<p><strong>SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>Deadline for Submission of Responses: November 12, 2014 by 5:15 p.m. Pacific Time</p>
<p>Submit Responses via e-mail to: Keith Fowler, Contract Specialist (keith.fowler@noaa.gov)</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THUNDERSTORM TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM<br />Request for Information Pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e)</strong></p>
<p>TITLE: Thunderstorm Spiral 15-3: Demonstrating Chemical and/or Biological Detection Capabilities on Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Platforms (Spiral 15-3a) and Countering Commercial UAS with Chemical and/or Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Payloads (Spiral 15-3b)</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: Technology Demonstration Collaboration</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for procurement or other acquisition proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology demonstration candidates from private industry, Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations and academia for inclusion in future Capability Demonstration events conducted by the Thunderstorm Technology Demonstration Program. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter by demonstrating the capability and technology in an operationally relevant environment. The application deadline is <strong>no later than 5:00 PM EST on 26 November 2014.</strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm is a series of technology demonstrations and other activities sponsored by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability and Prototyping, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO). In Fiscal Year 15 (FY-15) Thunderstorm will focus on two areas of interest: 1) chemical and/or biological detection capabilities deployed on Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) platforms and 2) countering commercial UAS with chemical and/or biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) payloads. <br />The first focus area will explore emerging technologies, technical applications and their potential to use a battery-powered Vertical Take-Off and Land (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to support the detection and identification of chemical and/or biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Capabilities of interest include (but are not limited to): <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; A system that is carried in one backpack up to systems carried/deployed from a HUMVEE-sized vehicle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; UAS payloads that can remotely detect and/or collect and transmit chemical and/or biological data to a receiving unit at least 1 kilometer from the sensing location. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The UAS should be operable by organic Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) unit personnel with minimal training and should be able to hover and land at or near the desired survey locations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The ground station should be able to provide visual displays of the sensing data received from the mobile detection systems. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The ground station may utilize autonomous operation (takeoff, navigation, sample detection/collection and landing) of the UAS utilizing standard geo-referenced satellite imagery that is either pre-loaded and/or downloaded on-demand from cellular or Wi-Fi networks. The autonomy interface should be simple enough to be learned in one day or less. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The UAS must be able to operate between 0 and 1000 feet above ground level (AGL) and should have a flight time of at least 30 minutes. UAS positional accuracy should be +/- 10 meters and altitude accuracy within 1 meter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The UAS should have a modular payload(s) capable of detecting one or more of the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Standard G, H and V series chemical agents in the vapor phase and/or liquid phase on surfaces or aerosolized particles (minimally at levels consistent with applicable Army field manual OSD required concentrations), <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Chemical agent precursors or degradation products, priority toxic industrial compounds and materials (TICs and TIMs) as specified by US Army Public Health Command (PHC) and/or collect samples remotely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Biological Warfare Agents (vegetative cells, spores and toxins) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Persistent and natural flora (providing biological surveillance on current and emerging flora). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Remote collection of samples for identification and confirmation at qualified DOD laboratories is required for biological payloads and highly desired for chemical payloads.</p>
<p><br />The second focus area will explore emerging technologies, technical applications and their potential to counter a low cost, small/man portable, Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) UAS carrying a chemical and/or biological WMD payload. Capabilities of interest include (but are not limited to): <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Collaboration and Intelligence (C5I) and sensor systems that facilitate rapid detection, identification and classification of UAS targets; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Electronic systems that can interdict defeat or deny hostile use of UAS. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Systems providing the capability to intercept and neutralize the UAS. Both kinetic and non-kinetic solutions are encouraged and should cover both CONUS and OCONUS applications.</p>
<p>Interested parties are welcome to submit their applications to participate in both or either of the above focus areas. Technologies at all classification levels will be considered. This RFI is for Thunderstorm Spiral 15-3, planned for 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 in Camp Shelby, MS.</p>
<p><strong>B. OBJECTIVE:</strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to demonstrate new and evolving technological capabilities in an operationally relevant environment, as well as to obtain insight into Federal technology gaps and emerging needs. The demonstration environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between government, academia and industry. This promotes the identification and assessment of emerging needs and mature technologies with the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to interagency partners. This event facilitates the identification of potential technology solutions to meet technical objectives. Thunderstorm provides a realistic demonstration environment for technology developers to interact with an operational command, which provides feedback on how their systems may support its needs. Materiel solutions brought to the event are at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 or greater.</p>
<p>The Thunderstorm Technology Demonstration involves individual or multiple technologies and is conducted with interagency partners. The demonstrator's parent company provides the technology and Thunderstorm personnel support the technology installation and integration into the overall demonstration. The demonstrator operates the system during the demonstration and uninstalls the system upon completion. The Thunderstorm staff plans, coordinates and assists with the associated logistics of the technology demonstration. The Thunderstorm staff will not assist with engineering the demonstrated technology or system.</p>
<p>Thunderstorm Spiral 15-3 field demonstration events will be conducted over a two week timeframe with one week dedicated to demonstrating chemical and/or biological detection capabilities on UAS platforms (Spiral 15-3a) and one week dedicated to countering Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) based UAS with potential WMD payloads (Spiral 15-3b). Field demonstrations will be conducted with interagency partners.</p>
<p><br /><strong>THE DEADLINES FOR APPLICATION PACKAGES is no later than 5:00 PM EST on 26 November 2014.</strong> Thunderstorm Spiral 15-3 demonstrations will be conducted from 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015, in Camp Shelby, MS. Under the direction of RRTO, the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) will act as the demonstration director for Spiral 15 demonstrations and host the receipt of the application packages.</p>
<p>After review of the demonstration applications, the Government may invite candidates to demonstrate their technologies during Thunderstorm with the intent to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities. Industry participation in demonstration activities does not suggest or imply that the Government will endorse, procure, or purchase equipment.</p>

IDI has the unique experience required to leverage their experience in working with key Ugandan government, professional and academician officials to assist USAMRIID with designing and delivering a self-sustaining training product tailored specifically to the needs of the Ugandan health care professionals. IDI has an extensive network of relationships with the Ugandan Ministry of health, directors of Ugandan medical professional organizations, the medical school dean and leading faculty at Makerere University. IDI is co-located with the Makerere University School of Medicine, which is critical as this is the key training site for training of trainers and the school must approve the training curriculum.  Any site farther away than 25 kilometers is unacceptable as transportation and telephone lines are unreliable.  IDI has the required experience and training which affords leverage of tapping into seasoned academic resources at the Makerere University and Mulago hospital.  This training product do not have the substantial time required for other companies to establish themselves in the highly political and cultural atmosphere currently in place in the Ugandan health care systems.  Such time would be costly and exceed the present budget allotted to USAMRIID for this effort.  The services provided by MUWRP/ IDI are unique and do not occur elsewhere by other entities operating in Uganda. There are no other known comparable organizations in Uganda with the type of experience and track record with the Makerere University College of Health Sciences and Infectious Diseases Institute.  The requirement is time sensitive as the projects are ongoing and the present period of performance has tight deadlines.  <br> No solicitation package will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement. <br>

Please use these attachments in preparing and submitting your firm's proposal: <br />Attachment 1 provides the Schedule with the contract line items (CLINs) for each requirement. <br />Attachment 2 provides a Statement Of Objectives (SOO) with a complete description of the requirements. <br />Attachment 3 provides MIL-PRF-27201E, Dated 17 MAY 2013.<br />Attachment 4 provides Aerospace Energy Clauses and Provisions. <br />Attachment 5 provides Transport Equipment Delay Certificate.<br />Attachment 6 provides Contractor Performance Data Sheet.<br />Attachment 7 provides Small Business Subcontracting Plan.</p>

<p>11. * Clause I209.09 EXTENSION PROVISIONS (DLA ENERGY JAN 2012) applies and is incorporated in full text in Attachment 4. I209.09 Extension Provisions (DLA Energy JAN 2012) allows the Government to extend the period of performance for up to six months on a unilateral basis.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor will be required to develop a methodology for integrating the required helicopter noise complaint data in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - Begin</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Excessive airport and aircraft noise produces stress and annoyance in local communities. National legislation, including the Aviation and Noise Abatement Act of 1978, addresses this problem by mandating the protection of the public's health and welfare through regulation of aircraft noise. The FAA is assessing community sentiment concerning the noise control issue and the Volpe Center is supporting the FAA's efforts by collecting and analyzing aircraft noise data.</p>
<p>Community response to helicopter operations in urban areas such as Los Angeles County, California, has led to a resurgence of interest in the characteristics of helicopter noise. Because much of what is currently known about helicopter noise concerns is based on anecdotal information, the FAA is interested in obtaining a more meaningful set of data that can help the FAA, Volpe Center, and the public better understand community response to helicopters. Specifically, the FAA is seeking data that correlates noise complaints about helicopters to specific helicopter operations in Los Angeles County. These correlated complaint data will allow the FAA to better predict and characterize helicopter noise levels or other characteristics associated with annoyance.</p>
<p>No single repository for helicopter complaint data exists in Los Angeles County. Existing noise complaint systems are located at airports in the Los Angeles area and do not cover the entirety of the region. Producing a comprehensive set of correlated helicopter noise complaint data for this area will require developing a methodology that can lead directly to a centralized system that can collect and integrate this information. This effort supports the FAA's commitment under the Los Angeles Helicopter Noise Initiative to explore a comprehensive helicopter noise complaint system for Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a methodology to collect the requisite helicopter noise complaint data and correlate that data with a complete set of flight tracks for helicopter operations in Los Angeles County. This will enable analysis of the correlated complaint data in the context of overall helicopter operations in the region.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Automated Complaint System implementation plan and technical correlation methodology</p>
<p>The contractor shall compile an Automated Complaint System implementation plan and correlation methodology in MS Word format and submit for final review to the Volpe Center within three weeks of purchase order award. This plan shall address system milestones, reporting schedule, the technical correlation methodology applied, and data metrics that would be provided by the contractor as part of the methodology.</p>
<p>Within three weeks of submission, the Volpe Center and FAA will provide stakeholder feedback on system format, schedule, methodology, data, etc. The contractor shall anticipate stakeholder feedback and make every effort to incorporate as much feedback as possible within one week of stakeholder response.</p>
<p>Deliverable: Automated Complaint System Implementation Plan (draft and final)<br />Schedule: Complete within seven weeks of purchase order award</p>
<p>Task 2: Automated Complaint System Demonstration</p>
<p>Within one month of completion of the Automated Complaint System Implementation Plan required in Task 1, i.e., Government acceptance, the contractor shall demonstrate to the Volpe Center and the FAA the capability of the Automated Complaint System and the fidelity of the correlation methodology to project requirements. This demonstration will consist of:</p>
<p>1) An initial report of correlated complaint data;<br />2)Demonstration consisting of an MS PowerPoint presentation, computer display, and other media, taking place in Los Angeles, California, in March 2015 (exact date TBD).</p>
<p>The Volpe Center and FAA will provide comments on this demonstration within three weeks, and the contractor shall make every effort to address all comments and system operational issues within two weeks of receiving stakeholder feedback, leading to a complete, fully operational Automated Complaint System, described and documented in a Summary Report. This system will adequately correlate noise complaints with helicopter operations per the technical requirements.</p>
<p>Deliverables: Automated Complaint System demonstration (initial report, presentation, Summary Report)<br />Schedule: Complete within 16 weeks of purchase order award</p>
<p>Task 3: Travel</p>
<p>As mentioned in Task 2, the contractor shall travel to Los Angeles, California, to demonstrate to the Volpe Center and the FAA the capability of the Automated Complaint System and the fidelity of the correlation methodology to project requirements. All travel performed under this order must be approved by the COR and shall be performed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation (FTR). The actual costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses will be considered reasonable and allowable if they do not exceed the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the FTR.

When postage is printed using a meter, it records each transaction so that the USPS can later collect postage from the postage meter company, such as Pitney Bowes. Therefore, USPS can record evidence of the postal transaction. Because of the restricted nature of USPS postage machines, the Government must use a postage machine by renting from a provider like Pitney Bowes. To avoid fraud, the function and use of postage meters is closely controlled by the USPS.</p>

<p>Factor 1: Technical capability<br />All quoters shall provide a technical proposal to include how the offeror will perform the contract in accordance with the specifications relevant to the attached statement of work. The Technical Proposal shall be as specific and complete as to clearly demonstrate to the Government that the offeror has a thorough comprehension of and capabilities to provide all aspects of the solicitation requirements. Statements that the quoter understands the requirement and can or will comply with the requirements will be considered inadequate. Quoters whose technical submittal are rated "Unacceptable" will be rejected and removed from further competition.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance <br />The quoter shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years prior to the solicitation closing date that is the same as or similar to the work described by this solicitation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate its past performance, the quoter shall identify up to two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years, and provide any other information the quoter considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Quoters should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. Past Performance will be assessed as follows: Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last three (3) years, will not be considered. In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The quoter shall complete a "Past Performance Information Form" for each reference submitted. The form is Attachment 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government reserves the right to consider past performance report forms received after the due date of the solicitation and to contact references for verification or additional information.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price<br />Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. The quoter shall provide sufficiently detailed information as to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price. Prices for all line items in the schedule above shall be provided. Price quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days.<br /><br /><br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the following factors: Technical capability, past performance and price. Award will be made to the low price, technically acceptable offeror, after which no other offers will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as does not meet the government's requirement's. If a quote's technical submission is determined to be Unacceptable it will no longer be evaluated or considered for award.</p>
<p>Factor II: Past Performance Acceptability: The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the quoter's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the quoter's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis in accordance with the ratings and description outlined below:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings <br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable: Based on quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully provide requested support services, or the quoter's performance record is unknown .<br />Unacceptable: Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully provide the required support services.</p>
<p>Note: Quoters lacking relevant past performance history or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorable on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendor's Past Performance is "unacceptable," that vendor's entire submittal will no longer be considered for further competition or award.</p>
<p>Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last 5 years, will not be considered. In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>In order to be considered Technically Acceptable the offeror must receive an "Acceptable" rating in both technical capability and past performance (Factor I and Factor II). Failure to obtain an "Acceptable" rating in Factor I or Factor II will result in an overall "Unacceptable" rating and elimination from the competition.</p>
<p>Factor III: Price: Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a). Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar services, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: It is the offeror's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair or overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010016 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-77. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair or overhaul vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component OEM, a capable repair or overhaul vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore, to be considered, must be deemed a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair or overhaul as applicable, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility and no other facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their repair data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future award consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is EADS CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICASS.A. DBA EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. The component OEM is NSD-INE-FRANCE, Cage Code F7761. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This is an UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS
Boehringer Suction Regulators


The VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS) currently owns 300+ Boehringer Suction Wall Units. New regulations require three regulators in each critical care area patient room; SICU (10 rooms x 3=30), MICU (8 rooms x 3=24), Telemetry (14 rooms x 2=28). The facility is currently showing a shortfall of these wall regulators in telemetry, PACU, and surgery rooms.

The VASLCHCS has trial tested several brands of regulators and Boehringer Suction Units is the choice of our trial committee. The previous units required costly maintenance and repairs per unit, and a short warranty period. Boehringer' s current warranty is 12 years per units, best in the industry, so the VASLCHCS will incur zero cost in maintenance and repairs.

Care 4 is the ONLY four mode suction regulator. It allows standardization to use the same suction regulator throughout the hospital.  Emergency Departments, Operating Rooms, Recovery Rooms, ICU's, Step Down units and procedure areas at the VASLCHCS will have a single durable instrument for all of their clinical suction needs.

The Care 4 provides patients with a suction device that has a dedicated FULL LINE vacuum mode and cannot be manually adjusted to potentially unsafe suction ranges. A current practice that allows the clinician to unknowingly expose patients to high vacuum, or allow for indwelling catheters to be left for long periods at high vacuum. The design of the Care 4 maintains the intermitting and continuous modes to vacuum levels clinically appropriate for routine adult interventions, but if higher levels are needed for emergent or surgical needs the clinician can quickly select this level of vacuum. A safety interlock also prevents inadvertent application this level of high vacuum.

The Care 4 will be used hospital-wide for suction therapy procedures needing Continuous of Intermitting suction including closed suction, deep suction and oral care. Also may be used in areas need high-flow, high-vacuum on demand. 

Features Required:
oModes: Off/ Intermit/Continuous / Full Line.
o0-200 mmHg regulated suction.
oFull Line Suction, with safety interlock
oPatented, wide view XL Gauge with color-coded fields that can be read from a distance or from the side.
oNo calibration required.
o12 Year Warranty.
oSelf-Cleaning Technology Protects against flooding and failure.
oValidated Reprocessing Methods Utilizing 270 F / 4 minute steam autoclave.
oFine resolution control knob.

Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number).

It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT5715Q80010 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-77, effective October 14, 2014. The NAICS Code is 541990; the Small Business size standard is $15 million.
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with collecting and analyzing aircraft noise data, specifically in the Los Angeles County, California area. The contractor will be required to develop a methodology for integrating the required helicopter noise complaint data in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - Begin</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Excessive airport and aircraft noise produces stress and annoyance in local communities. National legislation, including the Aviation and Noise Abatement Act of 1978, addresses this problem by mandating the protection of the public's health and welfare through regulation of aircraft noise. The FAA is assessing community sentiment concerning the noise control issue and the Volpe Center is supporting the FAA's efforts by collecting and analyzing aircraft noise data.</p>
<p>Community response to helicopter operations in urban areas such as Los Angeles County, California, has led to a resurgence of interest in the characteristics of helicopter noise. Because much of what is currently known about helicopter noise concerns is based on anecdotal information, the FAA is interested in obtaining a more meaningful set of data that can help the FAA, Volpe Center, and the public better understand community response to helicopters. Specifically, the FAA is seeking data that correlates noise complaints about helicopters to specific helicopter operations in Los Angeles County. These correlated complaint data will allow the FAA to better predict and characterize helicopter noise levels or other characteristics associated with annoyance.</p>
<p>No single repository for helicopter complaint data exists in Los Angeles County. Existing noise complaint systems are located at airports in the Los Angeles area and do not cover the entirety of the region. Producing a comprehensive set of correlated helicopter noise complaint data for this area will require developing a methodology that can lead directly to a centralized system that can collect and integrate this information. This effort supports the FAA's commitment under the Los Angeles Helicopter Noise Initiative to explore a comprehensive helicopter noise complaint system for Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a methodology to collect the requisite helicopter noise complaint data and correlate that data with a complete set of flight tracks for helicopter operations in Los Angeles County. This will enable analysis of the correlated complaint data in the context of overall helicopter operations in the region.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Automated Complaint System implementation plan and technical correlation methodology</p>
<p>The contractor shall compile an Automated Complaint System implementation plan and correlation methodology in MS Word format and submit for final review to the Volpe Center within three weeks of purchase order award. This plan shall address system milestones, reporting schedule, the technical correlation methodology applied, and data metrics that would be provided by the contractor as part of the methodology.</p>
<p>Within three weeks of submission, the Volpe Center and FAA will provide stakeholder feedback on system format, schedule, methodology, data, etc. The contractor shall anticipate stakeholder feedback and make every effort to incorporate as much feedback as possible within one week of stakeholder response.</p>
<p>Deliverable: Automated Complaint System Implementation Plan (draft and final)<br />Schedule: Complete within seven weeks of purchase order award</p>
<p>Task 2: Automated Complaint System Demonstration</p>
<p>Within one month of completion of the Automated Complaint System Implementation Plan required in Task 1, i.e., Government acceptance, the contractor shall demonstrate to the Volpe Center and the FAA the capability of the Automated Complaint System and the fidelity of the correlation methodology to project requirements. This demonstration will consist of:</p>
<p>1) An initial report of correlated complaint data;<br />2)Demonstration consisting of an MS PowerPoint presentation, computer display, and other media, taking place in Los Angeles, California, in March 2015 (exact date TBD).</p>
<p>The Volpe Center and FAA will provide comments on this demonstration within three weeks, and the contractor shall make every effort to address all comments and system operational issues within two weeks of receiving stakeholder feedback, leading to a complete, fully operational Automated Complaint System, described and documented in a Summary Report. This system will adequately correlate noise complaints with helicopter operations per the technical requirements.</p>
<p>Deliverables: Automated Complaint System demonstration (initial report, presentation, Summary Report)<br />Schedule: Complete within 16 weeks of purchase order award</p>
<p>Task 3: Travel</p>
<p>As mentioned in Task 2, the contractor shall travel to Los Angeles, California, to demonstrate to the Volpe Center and the FAA the capability of the Automated Complaint System and the fidelity of the correlation methodology to project requirements. All travel performed under this order must be approved by the COR and shall be performed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation (FTR). The actual costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses will be considered reasonable and allowable if they do not exceed the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the FTR. In accordance with FAR Subpart 31.205-46, a written justification must be provided to the COR for amounts higher than the FTR maximum amounts. Travel will be reimbursed at actual costs (with a copy of the receipts for expenses) in the following categories:</p>
<p>1.) Airline Tickets (commercial rates)<br />2.) Hotel Expenses (Government rates unless pre-approved by the COR)<br />3.) All Other Modes of Transportation (Taxi receipts are not required if less than $75.00)<br />Food and other miscellaneous expenses will be reimbursed at the prevailing FTR reimbursement rates.</p>

<SUBJECT>The Continuation of the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS)
<SOLNBR>AHRQ-1200003C-M05
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>110614
<CONTACT>Michelle D. Beatty, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014271781, Email michelle.beatty@ahrq.hhs.gov - Jessica Alderton, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1783, Fax 301 427-1740, Email jessica.alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>This synopsis provides the Government's intent to award a sole source modification to extend the period of performance of contract HHSA290201200003C "The Continuation of the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS)".  This cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract was originally competed and awarded to Qualidigm (aka Connecticut Peer Review), 1290 Silas Deane Hwy #4a, Wethersfield, CT 06109 on February 15, 2012. The current contract ends on February 14, 2015. The proposed modification will extend the contract for an additional 17 months through July 14, 2016.<br /><br />
<p>The current contract with AHRQ (HHSA290201200003C) is to perform analyses of MPSMS data in support of general patient safety research, and includes work specifically in support of AHRQ for the timely annual measurement of the national HAC rate for the Partnership for Patients (PFP).  Data and adverse events rates from MPSMS are needed for CY 2014 because the HHS Partnership for Patients (PFP) program has been extended through CY 2014, and data from MPSMS provides over 90% of information on the U.S. national rate of Hospital-acquired Conditions (HACs) that is used to determine if annual and overall PFP program goals are being met.</p>
<p>As a result of the one year extension to PFP, this will be a sole source modification to continue existing work for an additional 17 months (1 year for additional analysis of the 2014 data and 5 months for final analyses, report generation and contract wrap-up).  The proposed modification action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The extension of the PFP program by CMS was unforeseeable and not due to poor planning.  AHRQ requires a seamless continuation of the data analysis.  Qualidigm has been performing analyses on MPSMS data via several contracts with CMS and AHRQ since 2002, and has been the only contractor to perform this work. Qualidigm is the only contractor that can do this work to maintain the quality, validity, and consistency of the data analysis. The use of another contractor would significantly increase the possibility of disruption to the quality and validity of the data analysis.  Another contractor could not immediately learn and apply the data analysis methods and develop the clinical knowledge on the details of the MPSMS measures to provide data in a timely way to meet the quarterly, annual, and final data and analysis needs of the PFP program.  During the last five months of this contract, the contractor will be required to conduct final report generation and contract wrap up of all the data obtained and analyzed since 2002.  A new contractor would not have the background knowledge in this requirement necessary for a consistent and successful completion of this contract.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government as to whether or not to compete this proposed modification action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties regarding this sole source action may contact the Contract Specialist, Michelle Beatty, at michelle.beatty@ahrq.hhs.gov, no later than 10:00 am ET, November 6, 2014.  The final Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) / Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) supporting this sole source action will publicly be made available as required after contract modification award.</p>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of The Department of Defense (DOD) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties of an interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction (OTA) agreement with an eligible entity or group of entities to develop and mature technologies and support policy development to enable advanced approaches to electromagnetic spectrum use. This initiative will support possible needs across the government and industry, in alignment with the National Information Technology R&D (NITRD)/Wireless Spectrum R&D (WSRD) Senior Steering Group (SSG) mission to promote collaboration among government, industry and academia.   The purpose of this effort is to identify areas of Research & Development/Prototyping (R&D/PROTOTYPING) of vital importance to the Department's ability to maintain access to the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  The Government is seeking to facilitate optimal application of SRF funds in developing technologies that enable both spectrum sharing and more efficient spectrum use.      <br>        <br>    Section 845(a) (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. The Government must ensure that, when an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement for a prototype project under this authority, nontraditional defense contractor(s) participate to a significant extent in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.     <br>        <br>    Currently, the Government and industry share a common challenge of satisfying vastly increasing demand for the use of electromagnetic spectrum(s). Multiple efforts are addressing this fundamental issue as it hampers U.S. innovation and economic growth and hinders U.S. military operations both domestically and overseas.     <br>        <br>    The envisioned collaboration between the Government and Industry focuses on (but is not limited to) the following Science and Technology areas for consideration:     <br>        <br>    1.	Investments in Radar-Commercial communications sharing technologies, targeted initially to the 3.5 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  Rationale:  the Department is currently in discussions with both Industry and federal regulators to explore options for sharing portions of these bands with commercial wireless providers.  There is also international interest in sharing these regions of the EMS.  Investments in these technologies will enable the Department to maintain mission effectiveness and operational readiness while supporting our own, and the Nation's, strategic goal of spectrum sharing.    <br>        <br>    2.	Investment in use of Millimeter Wave (MMW) and Free-Space Optical (FSO) technologies for terrestrial and air-ground communications and C2/telemetry applications.  Rationale:  the Department's use of spectrum below 6 GHz for terrestrial and air-ground communications is vital to mission effectiveness; demand for these services is increasing and geographical availability of these spectral regions is static or declining, making sharing with commercial service providers difficult.  This problem is compounded in the case of air-ground communications and C2, where large exclusion zones have been encountered in the AWS-3 auction proceedings due to the nature of the airborne applications.   Investments in MMW and FSO technologies will enable the Department to strategically explore these spectral regions and transition terrestrial and air-ground services into these less congested areas.     <br>        <br>    3.	Development and deployment of the Air/Maritime Training Instrumentation (AMTI) waveform.  Rationale:  The AWS-3 auction proceedings enables commercial access to the lower portion (1755-1780 MHz) while DoD will have access to the upper portion (1780-1850 MHz) indefinitely.  Though this provides commercial access to only a small amount of spectrum, the economic and political situation at the time made this an acceptable solution.  Underlying this solution is the general understanding that industry will be seeking access to the upper portion in the near future.  One of the concepts that has been investigated is modifying the ACTS system to use a much more efficient waveform, the AMTI; using the AMTI will better position the Department to open up additional spectrum access, on a shared basis, with commercial service providers.     <br>        <br>    4.	Investments in Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Frequency Reuse (FR) technologies for communications and radar systems.  Rationale:  As sharing becomes more prevalent, systems will need to adjust dynamically to their current electromagnetic environment (EME) automatically and considering their geospatial and temporal location.  Investments in this area will enable the Department to consider more dynamic sharing scenarios and mechanism and improve reliability and mission effectiveness in spectrally-constrained environments.     <br>        <br>    5.	Investments in algorithms and approaches for improving spectrum situational awareness (SA), spectrum command & control (C2), and management of the electromagnetic environment.  Rationale:  As the Department moves towards sharing, with itself and with commercial service providers, while maintaining our ability to project power globally, it will be vital to improve our ability to maintain positive control of the spectrum resource and solid situation awareness of the spectrum  quote mark terrain quote mark , both from a friendly force and enemy force perspective.  This investment will develop technologies and techniques that can be deployed into land, air, sea, and cyber domain capabilities to achieve spectrum SA and C2 under the auspices of the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) doctrine.    <br>        <br>    6.	Investments in improvements for modeling and simulation of the Electromagnetic Environment (EME).  Rationale:  Emerging results from the DoD EMS Strategy Roadmap and Near-Term Action plan indicate that the Department must improve our ability to model and simulate the EME, to include assessing sharing approaches and techniques, and addressing attending interference and propagation effects.      <br>        <br>    7.	Investments in Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) and other communication and radar waveform efficiency technologies.  Rationale:  As more regions of the spectrum become open to sharing, the Department will need to be more efficient with our available spectrum access.   Investments now in basic and applied R&D/PROTOTYPING will yield useable technologies for programs in a few years at a time when spectrum sharing will be implemented on a wide scale.    <br>        <br>    8.	Interference tolerance and hardening technologies for communications and radar system.  Rationale:  As the department transforms to a share-first model, it will become increasing important for new communications and radar systems to be tolerant of interference that characterizes sharing environments.  Department R&D/PROTOTYPING investments now will create technologies mature enough to be implemented in programs later when spectrum sharing becomes more widespread, both nationally and internationally.    <br>        <br>    9.	Investments in adaptive RF technologies.  Rationale:  In Quadrennial Defense Review 2014, the Department recognized that the EMS, along with international waters and airspace and the cyber domain were vital to the Military's ability to project the force internationally.  As spectrum sharing increases both domestically and internationally, the Department will face additional barriers to spectrum access as it deploys into regions of the globe that either do not support sharing arrangements in particular bands or deny use of those bands.  It is prudent for the Department to invest in technologies now that will enable communications and radar systems to be able to change the spectrum regions in which they operate in response to either enemy action or the exercise of nation-state sovereign rights.    <br>        <br>    It is anticipated that industry members may propose forming a consortium that would seek to work with the Government through an OTA in this area. DOD and NITRD/WSRD recognize that both Government and industry can benefit from an OTA  with a consortium, in order to achieve more rapid contracting, acceleration of discovery, unparalleled ability to tailor research, policy consideration concurrent with technological advances, a more focused and synergistic research agenda, and relief from excessive  requirements.  Any company, university, or research organization is eligible to join the consortium.  The Government is seeking interested parties that are willing to join and/or establish a consortium with collective expertise in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).    <br>        <br>    The Government anticipates responses from this announcement from interested parties, with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support the NITRD/WSRD.  Interested parties shall provide a response no later than 4:00 PM EST on 14 November 2014 by email only.  Responses can be sent to Ms. Kristen Kachur, Contract Specialist, via email at kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

In an effort to promote a clear understanding of this requirement, the Government is soliciting comments and suggestions from potential Offerors. The goal is to obtain a more effective and less costly contract.    <br>        <br>    Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions, comments, and suggestions on any aspect of the draft solicitation via email to Ms. Keyonna Hogan at keyonna.l.hogan.civ@mail.mil    <br>    All questions, comments and suggestions shall be received by 1600 hours 14 October 2014.    <br>        <br>    Depending on the number of questions, comments and suggestions the Government intends to post all responses within approximately 15 calendar days after the response date.     <br>        <br>    The Government intends to conduct a formal pre-solicitation conference in the October 2014 timeframe.  Additional details will be forthcoming.    <br>        <br>    Changes, as appropriate, to the Government's requirement will be incorporated into any resultant formal solicitation, which will be posted to the ASFI website.     <br>        <br>    The Joint Project Manager for Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPM-RND is tasked to provide a standard Department of Defense (DoD) Radiological Detection System (RDS) that will replace the Joint Services current radiation detection, indication and computation (RADIAC) systems. The RDS will provide increased capability and enable the Joint Services to effectively conduct joint operations with interoperable equipment, by providing a network centric, rugged radiation detection capability for detection of the entire spectrum of radiological and nuclear hazards and threats.     <br>        <br>    The proposed RDS contract will include a ten (10) year period of performance which will be implemented in three (3) phases. Phase I is expected to be a 36-month effort and includes the System Integration and Demonstration to include design, development and manufacture of 14 test articles as well as support of government test activities.    <br>        <br>    Phase II includes the low rate initial production (LRIP) as Option 1, which may be exercised at the discretion of the Government based on need and results achieved in Phase I. Phase II is expected to be a 36 month effort for the production of 30 radiological detection systems. Phase II also includes ancillary support efforts as options.     <br>        <br>    Phase III includes Full Rate Production (FRP) as Option 2 which may be ordered over a five (5) year period at the discretion of the Government based on need and results achieved in Phase II. Phase III includes an Option for Initial Spare and repair parts.     <br>        <br>    It is anticipated that Phase I and Phase II (if exercised) will be awarded as a base  quote mark C quote mark  type contract.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 Incorporates attached Question and Answer Document posted 28 October 2014. <br>  <br> Purpose:    <br>    <br>  The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation - Program Manager, Aviation Systems (PM AS) - Product Manager Aviation Ground Support Equipment (PM AGSE) is in the process of developing requirements for an Airmobile, (transportable by CH 47 helicopter), Expeditionary , (used in the recovery of downed aircraft), Aircraft Maintenance Crane. This Request for Information (RFI) is to address requirements and capabilities as outlined in the Capabilities section below.  Recognizing that manufacturers have been designing and producing a variety of maintenance cranes for years; the Army is issuing this RFI to gather information pertaining to your current business and engineering practices. If feasible, the Army may incorporate some of your information in the specifications for the Aviation Maintenance Crane.  Your input is valuable and very much appreciated.  <br>    <br>  Capabilities: SCAMP II; Type II  <br>    <br>  	Threshold (T) = minimum requirement; Objective (O) = desired requirement  <br>    <br>  1.	Reach, Lift and Positioning: The Type II crane will lift 3000 lbs. (T); 7,500 (O); and raise the top of the main rotor head with sling attached to a height of 14 ft. (T), 20 ft. (O); and safely position the load from its point of origin to its maintenance support fixture. (T = O)  <br>  2.	The Type II will be capable of reaching and maneuvering the CH 47 aft rotor blade (360 lbs.) at a height of 21 Ft. with blade sling attached. (T); 25 Ft (O); and then safely position the load from its point of origin to its maintenance support fixture.  <br>  3.	The Type II will include a capability for simultaneous boom and winch operation, and will include a positive fail safe feature which will prevent dropping of the load when raising and lowering the hook, extending, or elevating or slewing the boom.  <br>  4.	The Type II will have hydraulically, mechanically, or electrically leveling outriggers.  <br>  5.	The Type II will have tip-over protection to provide the operator with passive indication of impending system overturning moments. (T); automatically warn the operator of unsafe system moments, and automatically interrupt lift operations if the rated capacity limitation with respect to overturning moment. (O)  <br>  6.	The Type II will be transportable by all modes of military and commercial transportation including highway, rail, marine and air.  Type II must be airmobile by CH-47 helicopter.   <br>  7.	The Type II crane will be self-propelled, able to negotiate primary roads, secondary roads, and trails, i.e. over surfaces ranging from maintained and paved, to dry, unimproved, seldom maintained loose surface roads intended for low density traffic.    <br>  8.	The Type II will be able to autonomously operate cross-country, i.e. over terrain not subject to repeated traffic and where no man-made improvements exist. (T); Autonomously sustain speeds of at least 10 MPH. (O)  <br>  9.	The Type II crane shall be compatible with the Army standard fuel (JP-8) (and commercial equivalent specification Jet A F-24) and other military spec products for oil and lubricants. (T); The Type II will be compatible with multi-fuels e.g. JP8, diesel, or diesel alternatives without special maintenance procedures required to switch between fuel types. (O)  <br>  10.	The Type II crane will have sufficient fuel capacity to operate for a minimum of four hours before fuel is required.  <br>  11.	The Type II will be operable using an on-board diesel engine. The Type II will also be operable by plugging into commonly available AC electrical power. (T = O).  <br>  12.	The Type II crane will include a capability for precision-control. Precision-control allows very slow, constant, continuous, fixed rate of motion of the hoist, boom, and swing functions and should not exceed 5% to 10% of the normal speed. All controls will permit safe, precision control of the load. The Type II boom and hook functions will be controllable via controls located at the operators control station. (T); The Type II remote control system for all boom and hook operations, capable of being operated from the immediate vicinity of the crane hook.  <br>  13.	The Type II will have a device that automatically prevents the hook from being raised too close to the upper block, thus preventing contact between the hook and block.  <br>  14.	The Type II will include night driving lights only if able to sustain speeds  greater than 10 mph.  <br>  15.	The Type II will include work lights, on/off switchable. The work lights will be self-contained and adjustable, enabling safe lifting operations. (T); Type II work lights shall be switchable to Night Vision System (NVS) compatible lighting. (O).  <br>  16.	The Type II crane will have a keyless operation (electric start) ignition system.  <br>    <br>  Caution:  <br>    <br>  Responders to this RFI are placed on notice that participation in this survey is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.

<CONTACT>Steven McDonald, Phone 256.450.1463, Fax 256.450.1463, Email steven.mcdonald@mda.mil
<DESC><strong>1 Objective<br /></strong>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is conducting market research to identify capability to support development and production of sub-assemblies and components for a redesigned kill vehicle for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This research will identify mature technologies and qualified parties capable of developing and producing sub-assemblies and/or components for the re-designed kill vehicle. Mature technologies are those products that are reliable, tested, cost effective, and ready for integration.
<p>This request for information (RFI) does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor should you construe it to be a commitment by the Government. Participation is strictly voluntary, and participants will bear all costs associated with responding to this RFI. White Papers submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>Replies will be separate from, and have no bearing on, evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any future request for proposal. Information received in response to this request may be used by the Missile Defense Agency for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. MDA will not provide feedback to the responses to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>2 Background<br /></strong>The mission of MDA is to defend the homeland, deployed forces, allies and friends against ballistic missiles and to accomplish this with layered defense and block upgrades to improve performance over time. In accomplishing this mission, the MDA has fielded a missile defense system that engages and destroys intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile threats in the midcourse phase. The current system relies on interceptors that use the kinetic energy from a direct hit to destroy the incoming ballistic missile threat. The interceptors' kill vehicles track the warhead and maneuver to collide with it. This hit-to-kill technology has been proven in a number of successful flight tests across multiple weapon system platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3 Specific Request for Information<br /></strong>MDA requests industry, universities, non-profit organizations, and government laboratories input to identify component developers that can provide specific mature kill vehicle sub-assemblies, components, algorithms, software, with open interfaces, that are suitable to a redesigned exo-atmospheric kill vehicle. The specific items are identified in Table 1 below. MDA requests that respondents submit descriptions of the technology, maturity level, lead time to produce, and currently available production capacity. Components, etc., should be at least at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 5 with a path to TRL Level 7 over a 12-18 month timeframe and with commensurate manufacturing readiness.</p>
<p>MDA also requests respondents provide schedules/timelines and approaches for key demonstrations necessary to support a redesigned kill vehicle product development program (e.g., simulation, hardware in the loop, laboratory and field testing).<br /><br /><strong>Table 1. RFI Request Items</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Communication sub-assembly*<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Radio transmission and receiver units*<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Antenna (e.g., Electronically steered phased-array or patch antennas)*<br />&bull; Battery*<br />&bull; Inertial Measurement Units*<br />&bull; Discrimination algorithms and/or software applicable to midcourse defense against long range ballistic missiles with countermeasures*<br />&bull; Survivability in HAENS environment (e.g., hardened components, detection, reset and recovery)*<br />&bull; Separation device*<br />&bull; Advanced sensor*<br />&bull; Cables and connectors*<br />&bull; High Pressure Fuel and Oxidizer Tanks<br />&bull; Laser Initiators and Hot Gas Generators</p>
<p>*Supporting details in classified annex</p>
<p>MDA may use the responses to identify candidate mature technologies which show potential to meet the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints of the redesigned kill vehicle and which have the potential to interface with the rest of the vehicle. Further communications with respondents whose sub-assemblies and/or components show such potential may be pursued.</p>
<p>An initial set of sub-assemblies which MDA has identified within a redesigned kill vehicle are described in the classified annex to this RFI. This set is subject to revision and new ideas are welcome in replies to this RFI. Respondents having capability to produce components that can contribute to the performance of these subsystems are also encouraged to respond.</p>
<p><strong>4 Instructions<br /></strong>Interested respondents will require facility clearances of no less than "SECRET," with a minimum of "SECRET" safeguarding and all employees will be citizens of the U.S. or lawful permanent residents.</p>
<p>Interested firms who believe they are capable of providing the above mentioned items are invited to request the classified annex by providing the following:</p>
<p>Company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), Cage Code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of this information each company will be provided a DD Form 254 CONTRACT SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION.</p>
<p>Address questions concerning this RFI via e-mail or in writing to:</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the Joint Project Manager - Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS), awarded a sole source to the contractor Illumina, Inc., of San Diego, California for the purchase of One (1) TruSeq Stranded Total RNA HT (With Ribo-Zero Globin) Reagent Kit for use with current MiSeq Analyzers in support of the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) Program, a commercial supply for which the Government solicited to only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), as agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  <br>  <br> Illumina, Inc. is the owner of the intellectual property (IP) and sole producer of these specific reagent kits which includes the high-throughput Stranded total RNA sample preparation kit for Ninety-Six (96) Samples. This kit is designed by Illumina and includes all the controls and reaction chemicals specifically formulated to prepare samples for RNA sequencing on Illumina analyzers including the MiSeq. RNA sample preparation kits made by other vendors will not adequately prepare the RNA for analysis by the MiSeq Analyzer. (Each library preparation kit makes use of its own proprietary chemistry, involving specialized adaptors and ligation and amplification steps).  <br>  <br> No other company could provide this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  <br> Illumina, Inc. is a registered in the System for Award Management as an Other Than Small Business under NAICS 334513, the size standard for which is 500.  <br>  <br>
