Contract line item -TBD<br />14. Contract Award Date - Anticipate&nbsp;April 2011<br />15.&nbsp;Contractor - TBD<br />16. Description -&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Heath and Human Services, HHS, is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services. One tool to communicate with the public and to educate HHS staff on policy and issues is through video. These video products are part of new and on-going messaging campaigns to the public and key stakeholders. The key stakeholders are but not limited to, senior HHS staff, Congress and media outlets. The HHS broadcast studio provides training, informational, and media outreach products to staff and the general public. Products include a variety of video programs such as, live satellite broadcasts and media tours, long format documentaries, public service announcements, and web-based media products.
<p>In addition to producing video products there is a need for the daily staffing, production management, engineering and maintenance of the HHS studio. The active HHS studio requires daily operational staffing to support studio functions, editing requirements, field production, engineering, maintenance, as well as, other routine studio tasks.</p>
<p>HHS also requires video production and video engineering services during times of national health emergencies at the Continuity of Operations site(s). The types of personnel and services are to be determined at the time of need. Due to the nature of this need, the amount of preparation time and time at the site is impossible to establish.</p>
<p>HHS requires a comprehensive range of production services including such tasks as writing, producing, directing, on-camera talent, camera operating, graphics production, audio technicians, teleprompting, makeup, broadcast engineering, production coordination &amp; management, video editing and mastering. HHS may also require the rental of studio and field production equipment, as well as, the fabrication of sets and the acquisition of props. HHS productions generally fall into one of three categories: 1) live satellite broadcasts or web-casts from the HHS studio or remote locations, 2) ENG/EFP - sometimes in areas affected by disasters, 3) "film-style" shoots (with scripts, scenes, actors, locations, etc.). Production crewing services are required locally for sites across the continental US and internationally on short notice.<br /><br />17. Place of Performance - 200 Independence Ave, SW Washington, DC 20201<br />18. Set Aside Status - Limited to eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business<br /><br />All requests regarding the solicitation shall be via email only, Lisa.Durant@psc.hhs.gov</p>
