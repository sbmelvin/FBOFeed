BUDGET:		$80 to $100 Million Construction Range 
FUNDING:				Funds Are Not Currently Available
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:	At least 35% of the level of contract effort must be perfomed in the State of California
SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE:	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal facilities of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees and visitors; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service). As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The project will be LEED certified. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Calexico-West Border Station project will expand and renovate the existing land port of entry located on the United States border with Mexico in the state of California. The proposed site is located in the heart of Calexico/Mexicali bi-national metropolis along the United States/Mexico border, 95 miles east of San Diego, California, and 50 miles west of Yuma, Arizona.   The Calexico-West Border Station, a significant gateway to the United States, will transform an existing obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art port of entry. The new border should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America.   The project delivery method will be Traditional Design-Bid-Build.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of work is to provide professional design services for the Calexico-West Border Station Expansion/Renovation project.  At a minimum, the scope will include architectural design, systems engineering, traffic engineering, safety engineering, security engineering, interior design, landscape design, and related consulting services for the project.  The deliverables shall include all that is needed to enable the construction contractor successfully understand the project, its design, and its construction requirements.  At the beginning of the design-services, the Lead Designer and A/E Team shall present to the Government its intended design approach for the handling of design, engineering, and construction of the project.  During the design services, deliverables shall include concept design documents, design development documents, metric construction documents (METRIC IS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT), specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, computer-aided design (CAD) documents, building information modeling (BIM—for all projects receiving design funding in FY07 and beyond, GSA requires spatial program building information models as a minimum requirement for submissions to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner; GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies—spatial program validation and beyond—at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges) and optional post-construction contract services (PCCS).  

The project proposes to change the existing Calexico-West Border Station, through a series of demolition, renovation, and major expansion work, to create a modern, secure, and energy efficient port of entry.  The Calexico-West Border Station is currently dedicated to the inspection of passenger occupied vehicles and pedestrians crossing the border.  Commercial vehicle traffic is handled by Calexico-East Border Station, located approximately 6.5 miles east of Calexico-West Border Station.  Close to 35,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians cross the border in both directions each day.  The number of existing inspection booths is insufficient to adequately serve the current daily border traffic.  

The Calexico-West Border Station comprises three separate parcels of federal government-owned properties: (1) the Old Custom House site; (2) the Main Building site; and (3) the vacated 14-acre site referred to as the “Commercial Port-of-Entry”.  The Old Custom House is used for the administrative functions of the Department of Homeland Security-Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS-CIS).  The Main Building houses the central operational functions of the port of entry.  The vacated Commercial Port of Entry has several minor structures and is being utilized as temporary parking lot for federal employees.  A private commercial property separates the old Custom House and the Main Building.  A railroad track right-of-way with multiple tracks separates the Main Building from the vacated Port of Entry.  The railroad track serves a cross-border freight train that runs at least twice a day.  The Old Custom House, which is listed on the Federal Register of Historic Places, will be divested through regular government disposal process. The Main Building is an elevated two-story structure with a mezzanine, and it will be renovated and retained for pedestrian traffic control.  The 14-acre vacated Commercial Port of Entry site contains a truck building and a modular trailer, both of which will be demolished in order to develop the site.  The site will be developed for processing non-commercial passenger vehicles inspection.  The site will house a proposed new building complex called the Headhouse, primary and secondary inspection areas, and other facilities required for expanded operation.  Two additional properties, privately owned, are considered for acquisition and inclusion in the project.  A stream of polluted water called New River runs along the western edge of the Calexico Border Station.  A culvert to contain the river from contaminating the U.S. is planned and will be considered in the project design.

The Calexico-West Border Station primarily serves the local communities and the surrounding region on both sides of the border, therefore community interest in the project will be strong.  The border station will remain in operation throughout the construction phase of the project.  Prior to the final design, a substantial amount of comparative design analysis will be required to determine the most efficient and least costly northbound/southbound routing of major roads through the border station.  Secondary roads, walkways, material handling docks, staging areas, and river containment must also be addressed in the design of the project.  

The government-estimated total construction cost for the project is in the range of $80,000,000 to $100,000,000.  The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately five years after the date of the design services contract award.  The Firm Fixed Price base for the Architect-Engineer Design Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept phases for the Calexico-West Border Station Project advertised here.  Options will be priced separately.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the additional work identified as options.  The scope of the Architect-Engineer Design Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract may include options for additional work such as: Pre-design services including special studies, site-surveys, site investigation, schematics design, design development, preparation of CAD working drawings (DO NOT WANT TO REQUIRE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE), and contract documents, specifications, estimating services, value engineering, post-construction award services, metric conversion,  and other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.  

All facilities, existing and new, incorporated in the design, shall conform to the latest IBC, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements (POE ARE EXEMPT FROM BLAST MITIGATION AND PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE REQUIREMENTS), utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).  Provisions for 3D-4D Building Information Modeling (BIM) shall be provided.  The facilities shall also respond to the need to reduce energy consumption, and achieve an acceptable level of green sustainability through LEED Silver certification.  The project is also to meet the appropriate federal design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service); EPACT 2005 compliance; and customer agency requirements, including the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide,

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), Radar Operations, Engineering Services and procurement of ancillary equipment in support of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) family of X-band radars ? the AN/TPY-2 X-band radars, the Sea Based X-band radar (XBR), and GBR-P Radar.  Under this effort, the contractor shall provide all engineering, operations, engineering services and logistics/sustainment support that includes but is not limited to: radar operation, site survey and engineering services, preventative and corrective maintenance, administrative security, spare parts, depot services, training, facilities design, procurement of ancillary equipment and personnel.  The period of performance of this contract consists of a five-year base period and 5 one-year options. The first AN/TPY-2 is operating at Shariki, Japan.  The operational locations for the other radars have not yet been determined.  They may be within or outside of the continental United States.  MDA intends to negotiate a contract with the Raytheon Corporation for these services, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1-(a) (i): only one responsible source.  As the developer of the aforementioned x-band radar family Raytheon is the only company that can provide all of the CLS functions discussed above as they are currently needed for the support of BMDS deployment and operational requirements.  Utilization of any other source would result in unacceptable delays in deploying the radar to operational sites, jeopardize mission performance with new personnel inexperienced with the radar's design, operation, and maintenance, require a substantial non-recurring investment to acquire a Technical Data Package and qualify a new production source, and would require substantial non-recurring training costs to enable personnel not familiar with the technology to understand its operation and maintenance.  Personnel working this program are required to be US Citizens and field personnel must have at least a Secret clearance. Contractor employees may be required to accompany Government/Military personnel when one or more of these radars are deployed.  Raytheon will be required to negotiate Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) with the lead system integrators of the Sea Based X-Band (XBR) program and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program.  The ACAs will ensure a smooth integration, operation, and maintenance of the XBR and THAAD Radars.  Entities that plan to assert that they are qualified to perform this effort must submit a statement of corporate capabilities relevant to this effort.  Said statement shall not exceed 5 pages in length and must be submitted to the POC not later than the closing date of this announcement.  Note 22 Applies****.

Engineers are shared between V-22 Development Avionics Systems Engineering and the Software Support Activity (SSA) so that the same engineer working on the latest V-22 avionics development is also working to solve V-22 fleet issues and recommending fleet enhancements.  RTSC engineers also provide extensive inputs into avionics development, integration, and production by working on V-22 avionics Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the prime contractor (Bell-Boeing), avionics suppliers, and the Government.  RTSC is the Governments designated representative to perform Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application System Software (JASS).

(B) V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) and Software Development. RTSC will continue to provide avionics systems and software engineering to resolve post-production issues and develop enhancements for autopilot (a.k.a. Flight Director), navigation, control of communication systems, aircraft & engine health monitoring, mission management and mission planning correlation, sensors & EW management, and reporting and management of various other subsystems.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2006.

17.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS), V-22 Desktop Test Environment (DTE), V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS), V-22 Laboratory Management and Update, and V-22 Avionics Simulation Software. This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007. RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).  The VMPS is comprised of two Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs).  These items have been procured from RTSC under a multi-year ongoing phased developmental effort.  The VMPS CSCIs are the Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), which is the software framework that is used as a basis for VMPS, and the V-22 Unique Planning Component (UPC) that implements V-22 unique mission planning functionality.

(B) V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS) Development and Production.  The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC.  It is a system that will connect to the Troop Commander Panel provided in the V-22 passenger cabin, and will provide situational awareness data to V-22 passengers.  The VISAS uses simulation software products developed by RTSC.  This is an ongoing project that has been in development for six years, and will continue to be updated during the MV-22 Block C and CV-22 Block 20 developments. The initial version of
VISAS is required for CV-22 IOT&E in October 2007.

(C) V-22 Laboratory Management and Upgrade, and Avionics Software Simulation Products. The main avionics facility that is used by all RTSC Indianapolis projects is the V-22 Avionics Integration Laboratory (VAIL).  RTSC will continue to expand the VAIL capabilities as new hardware is received to support the Software Support Activity (SSA).  Avionics Software Simulation Products include V-22 Dynamic Display System (VDDS), Simulation Control
(SIMCNTRL), JVX Simulation Support Software - Automated Test Tool (JSSS-ATT), Virtual Emulated Mission Data Loader (VEMDL) and Bus Controller Tool (BC-Tool).  Desktop Test Environment (DTE) software takes all of the Avionics Software Simulation products and migrates
them from a Unix-based workstation to a Personal Computer (PC) environment.  Additionally, DTE adds a simulation of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application Support Software (JASS) so that software developers have a "virtual lab" available to help test and develop avionics
software.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2006.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a Request for Quotation or a solicitation.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond WA, for the renewal fo Microsoft Premier Support,  Account Number 64494.  Microsoft Premier Support includes the following services: 1) Service Elements, 2) Problem resolution support, and 3) Information services and workshops.  Service elements include the following: 1) Up to 200 hours of service resource time, 2) SAM and SA hours, which can be used for infrastructure support assistance, reviews, development support assistance, and lab, 3) planning and resource facilitation, 4) status meetings and reporting, and 5) escalation management.  The Problem Resolution Support includes 1) 50 support incidents, 2) hot fixes, 3) critical problem alerts, and 4) multi-vendor coordination.  The information services and workshops include the following: 1) newsflashes, and 2) unlimited-user service desk license, which includes 1 prepaid site visit (up to 2-days, NA only), 1 Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription (single server), and 1 MSDN Subscription.  Microsoft Premier Support from Microsoft provides direct and quick access to internal Microsoft software developers and source codes for current and future products twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  The BOP requires such resources because system failures that are not resolved quickly could jeopardize the safe and secure operation of BOP institutions.  Purchasing support from a reseller or  third party vendors does not meet the BOP?s requirement, as the BOP would not have direct access to Microsoft?s source code and software developers, which are essential for the immediate access the BOP needs to resolve system failures that may impact the operations of our institutions.  This proposed noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13.  The BOP plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, Arrow Point 2, 8050 Microsoft Way, Charlotte, NC 28273.  The period of performance will be November 27, 2006 through November 26, 2007.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Any information shall be clearly marked with reference: NAS-0063-2007, and must be received on or before November 16, 2006 by 12:00 noon eastern standard time.  Any information not received by the date/time and at the location specified in this notice will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Greg Sinsel, Contracting Officer, at the address and phone numbers listed below.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)] for a Launch Vehicle Stage Severance System.   The ARES I Launch Vehicle is a new launch vehicle NASA is developing to replace the Space Shuttle and to return astronauts to the moon.  ARES I-1 is the first flight of this new launch vehicle and will demonstrate ascent flight control system performance.  The upper stage will be an inert mass model.  One of the primary objectives of the first flight will be to demonstrate nominal First Stage/Interstage and Upper Stage separation and clearances.  This Statement of Work (SOW) is for the design, development, fabrication, testing, integration, and shipping of the complete severance system.  The severance system shall include the severance ring, upper and lower flange rings, ETL and ETL manifolds.  The term Separation System includes the severance system which is the purpose of this procurement and the Booster Deceleration Motors (BDM) and their associated ETL’s which are not part of this procurement. The severance ring shall use pyrotechnics to completely separate the upper stage from the interstage about 2 minutes after launch from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). See Figure 1 below, showing a side view of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) and ARES I-1 Upper Stage Simulator. See Figure 2 for CLV Pyrotechnic events. During ascent, the launch vehicle skin will be mostly in compression due to rocket engine thrust.  However, there are bending modes of the vehicle during flight that will put the severance system into both compression and tension.  Just prior to triggering the severance system, eight BDM will provide a downward thrust to the first stage, thus putting the severance joint into tension. See Figures 3 and 4 for the BDM locations. There is a short time delay between the firing of the BDM and the firing of the severance system. The development, testing, fabrication and flight qualification of the severance system will require a aggressive schedule.  NASA GRC is requesting a delivery of an Engineering Test Unit (ETU) in October, 2007 and a full test qualification unit in March, 2008.  The first flight severance system is expected in June, 2008.  The flight of ARES I-1 is scheduled for April, 2009.  A second flight article may (or may not) be purchased for delivery in December 2008 for a follow on flight that is currently TBD.  NASA is open to industries’ creative design with the proposed system having demonstrative flight heritage. The Contractor shall support NASA during integration and system level Functional Verification testing planned at NASA Plum Brook (PB) near Sandusky, OH and at KSC, FL.	A full scale separation test will be performed on a severance system in a vacuum facility at the PB location.  At the KSC, the Contractor shall support the integration at the Vehicle Assembly Building. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336419 and 1000 respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on November 1, 2006 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about November 30, 2006. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.   All contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer, Irene Cierchacki at Irene.Cierchacki-1@nasa.gov; SUBJECT: Questions on NNC07ZDE002R.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<RESPDATE>082906
<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2092, E-Mail: tharp.scott@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, 2890 Woodbridge Avenue, Edison, New Jersey, requires paving for the Urban Watershed Research Facility (UWRF).  Several different types of pavement are required.  Pavement type will be a mix of porous pavement (block and poured), hot mix asphalt (HMA) and paver stones.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the project.  The project consists of two objectives:  (A) Connect parking lot and laboratories to the road leading up to the UWRF.   (B) Allow the evaluation of porous pavement as a method of stormwater treatment and volume control. The Contractor shall:  (1) Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the required pavements can be installed.  Approximately 3700 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of the area.  Grading and trenching shall adhere to current grade.  A 65 ft long, 2 ft wide trench shall be required for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  This trench shall carry piping and will be back-filled with pea gravel and capped with concrete block as described in the next section on porous pavement.   (2) Pave approximately 1560 sq ft with Porous Pavement.  Four separate segments shall be constructed with separate drainage for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  Two concrete treatments shall be used, blocks and poured pavement, each with two sections.  Each section shall measure 30 by 12 ft and be lined with an impermeable liner and a 2 in. diameter drainage pipe (HDPE 80) heat sealed to the liner.  The liner shall be puncture resistant, minimum of 6 mil thickness, and ideally should completely cover each section and sides to surface (15 ft by 35 ft).  The pipes shall be placed on top of liner and heat sealed at each end (four heat seals in all).  Drainage pipes shall be provided by EPA.   (3) A 10 ft wide and 140 ft. long vehicle access run of a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) strip is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be as straight as possible given the layout of the facility and the requirements for the porous pavement above.  This asphalt strip should abut the new porous pavement. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  An additional 10 by 60 ft and 10 by 12 ft section is anticipated.  Total estimated area of coverage is 2120 sq ft.   (4) The contractor shall provide five walkways connecting buildings to the new asphalt strip.  The location will be from the greenhouse, laboratory trailers, walk-in freezer, and high bay.  The width of walkway runs should match with access ways and doors.  The most economical method for walkway construction may be used.  However, a portion (10% to 33%) of these walkways for this task is required to be rubber sidewalks made from recycled tires.  These strips of recycled tires are anticipated to sit on a base material 2 to 4 inches thick with an impermeable liner beneath and are estimated to be 3 times as costly as concrete walkways.  Piping for drainage and monitoring will be provided.  The upper estimate of total walkway coverage is 250 sq ft.   Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. Acceptance of the overall project will be by Contractor demonstration the installed Porous Pavement System performs as required by the objectives of this project.   A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Three (3) evaluation factors will be used: Technical Expertise, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Expertise and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price.  The anticipated contract performance period is 60 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, and site visit information, will be released through the internet on the Fedbizopps website.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 15 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.  All sections of the hotel have been found to meet or exceed the Access Boards standards.  The hotel is centrally located for the participants with great access for individuals with disabilities.  Needs vary but include roll-in showers, hearing impaired, and guide dog services.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than Thursday, November 09, 2006 at 2:00pm EST.  Affirmative responses shall reference ABA-02010-07-0009 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.

<CONTACT>Kathy Laffey-Miller Contract Specialist 937-267-3952
<DESC>The Veterans Integrated Service Network, Ohio, (VISN 10) intends to negotiate a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B),with Ohio Hospital Association (OHA) for the provision of a Continuous Survey Readiness (CSR) Program with Joint Commission Resources (JCR) and various counterparts within the State of Ohio.  The proposed contract duration is 3 years, which includes 2 option years to be utilized at the Government's discretion.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the OHA is the only source capable of providing the services specific to the needs of VISN 10.  OHA provides the following unique services: 1. Access to first hand information directly from actual Joint Commission (JC/JCR) surveyors.  OHA is the only local source that can provide this due to the 2004 implementation of the JC conflict of Interest Policy.  Other sources include JCR itself and other state hospital associations.  2.  Although JCR can provide mock survey services directly, they do not offer cross-reference networking with local/state peers, as well as the whole CSR program.  3.  Although other state hospital associations offer the CSR program, they can not offer state specific guidelines that are not covered under the umbrella of the federal government.  As a federal facility, the VA adheres to Federal/VA laws and regulations.  In the absence of Federal/VA laws and regulations, state laws are applicable.  As such, the laws of any state other than Ohio, would not be applicable to VISN 10 and any other state's CSR program would not be relevant to VISN 10.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Firms in disagreement with this decision must submit information to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business 4:30 P.M., E.S.T., November 8, 2006.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Any written response may be sent to the Contracting Officer via fax at (937) 262-5974.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for e-mail correspondence and it may not be responded to.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Contracting Officer has the right to accept or reject any information if it is not complete, accurate and relevant.  The Contracting Officer shall make the final decision regarding the information submitted.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) has a requirement to migrate all Non-secure Internet Protocol Routed Network, Secure Internet Protocol Routed Network (NIPR/SIPR) and Coalition network Personal Computing assets to Thin Client  technology that will eliminate the need for local desktop processing. To meet this requirement, USASMDC must upgrade its Storage Area Network/Network Attached Storage (SAN/NAS), on which all USASMDC shared resources reside. The upgrade will consist of rep lacing much of the current SAN/NAS with new leased equipment and trading in the old equipment for monetary value that to be applied to the leasing cost. The upgraded system will have new equipment maintenance included.  Execution of the upgrade must have m inimal effect on the USASMDC general user population. EMC, Inc., is the source of the current SAN/NAS solution in place at USASMDC and is the only source from which the upgrade can be obtained. The Government intends to award this effort to CDW-Government,  a major reseller of EMC, Inc., which will provide the lease as EMCs preferred leasing vendor. The Government has determined that award of this effort to any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government which cannot be recouped thro ugh competition, unacceptable delays in implementing the system upgrade, and an unacceptable risk to mission. The period of performance is one year, with the upgrade beginning immediately, and with two consecutive one year options for continued lease of th e upgraded system. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDCM-AK/Koger. This  notice of intent is not a request for proposal from any source other than CDW-G; however, all proposals received will be considered by the Government.

Special Focus Area:

OPTICAL LATTICE EMULATOR (OLE) BAA 06-19, Addendum 7; DUE: JAN 12, 2007. TECHNICAL POC: Dr. John R. Lowell, DARPA/DSO, Phone: (571) 218-4685, Email: BAA06-19@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/.

DESCRIPTION

(Note:  This BAA Addendum 7 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA06-19)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals for the development of a tool with an unprecedented capability to emulate computationally intractable, strongly-correlated, many-body condensed matter materials or models for materials for which we have no verifiable theoretical solution or experimental realization. Such a tool should enable profound changes in our fundamental understanding of advanced materials such as high-temperature superconductors. In addition, the tool developed under this program will permit the design and investigation of novel material systems.

Proposals are requested for research programs that demonstrate the ability to produce phase diagrams for strongly-correlated, many-body condensed matter systems via an "optical lattice emulator" or OLE. The OLE would utilize ultra-cold gaseous atoms, ions, or molecules confined by an optical lattice to produce quantum mechanical models of condensed matter materials. It is expected that each research effort will consist of an interdisciplinary team capable of developing all of the following capabilities: 1) Techniques for producing ultra-cold degenerate gases; 2) Techniques for producing and manipulating optical lattices; 3) Techniques for engineering specific Hamiltonians relevant to strongly-correlated condensed matter systems; 4) Techniques for characterizing cold atoms, ions, or molecules in optical lattices; and 5) Theoretical and computational techniques that support the development of methods for measurement of system properties, verification of experimental parameters, and validation of the fidelity of the entire optical lattice-based emulator.

BACKGROUND

Recent breakthroughs in atomic physics have demonstrated several of the capabilities needed to produce physical "emulator" systems that map quantum mechanically onto condensed-matter systems and materials or models of them. These early conceptual breakthroughs included: the formation of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) [Science 269, 198 (1995) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 3969 (1995)], experimental demonstration of cold atoms in an optical lattice [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 630 (1997)], and the formation of a Degenerate Fermi Gas (DFG) [Science 285, 1703 (1999)]. These demonstrations lead one to imagine forming artificial materials composed of ultra-cold atoms held in locations specified by the optical lattice sites. Well-established atom-atom interactions that may be controlled by a number of methods govern the properties of this artificial material; the ability to control interactions this allows one to formulate a system governed by a particular, desired Hamiltonian, allow the system to evolve, and measure its material and thermodynamic properties. In effect, one may use the atoms placed in the optical lattice to emulate a completely different material, albeit one that shares an underlying Hamiltonian of the same form.

More recent experiments have demonstrated further refinement of the experimental techniques needed to probe such a system but technical advances are needed in a number of areas to propel these initial demonstrations to the point of being an effective tool for computational material science, namely the Optical Lattice Emulator (OLE). These areas include (but are not limited to): efficient and rapid (approximately 5 sec) formation of large (greater than a million atom) quantum gases for loading into optical lattices; control of atom loading to include number of atoms per lattice site, multi-species loading, doping and defect implantation; manipulation and control of optical lattice crystal structures to include inducement of stresses and dislocations; measurement of ?material? or ?thermodynamic? properties (of the emulated system) such as high-order spatial and temporal correlation functions, particle ordering, structure factors, band gaps, etc.; and theoretical efforts to guide, verify, and consolidate measurements and their interpretation into clearly interpretable OLE output.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES

The goal of this Program is to develop a tool based on ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices that will enable emulation of computationally intractable, strongly-correlated, many-body condensed matter systems or materials for which we have no verifiable theoretical solution.

The OLE Program will be separated into two phases. The Phase I goal is to validate the underlying techniques by ultimately producing a phase diagram depicting distinct thermodynamic and/or quantum-mechanical phases for a benchmark Hamiltonian as a function of at least two relevant variables.

Phase I will be a research effort of not more than 24 months. Phase I program milestones are:
1.	Design, build and utilize an Optical Lattice Emulator to produce a phase diagram depicting the boundaries between at least two distinct thermodynamic and/or quantum-mechanical phases for a benchmark Hamiltonian (such as the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, 2D Ising, or other computationally realizable Hamiltonians) as a function of at least two variables. The above experimental characterization ("emulation") should be completed in less than 12 hours, and must be repeatable.  
2.	Verify OLE output by theoretical or computational means for the physically realized Hamiltonian. The comparison between OLE output and the theoretical or computational verification should be done for an identical number of plotted points in the phase space diagram, and should show identical behavior in each phase identified. Finally, the location of the phase transition(s) produced by the OLE output should be verified to be accurate to better than 90%.

Phase II is expected to be a research effort between 24 and 36 months. The Phase II goal is to extend the OLE tool to the verification of Hamiltonian models that have novel phases such as high-temperature superconductivity, quantum magnetism, or supersolids; these models should be able to guide follow-on material development programs.

To realize the program vision and meet the Phase I milestones, each research effort requires performers with expertise in all of the following areas:
1.	Experimental production of ultra-cold degenerate quantum gases (BEC and DFG). In particular, expertise in the rapid production of the degenerate gases, precision experimental control, and novel measurement techniques will be necessary.
2.	Experimental production, control, and characterization of optical lattices.
3.	Theoretical atomic physics.
4.	Theoretical condensed matter physics, especially computational efforts to predict phase properties of strongly-correlated many-body Hamiltonians.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

As described in BAA06-19, proposals shall consist of two volumes: Technical and Cost. Only full proposals are being accepted under this Addendum. Follow the general guidelines for BAA06-19 full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

Each technical proposal must have a clearly defined research team and management approach. The research team must incorporate people with expertise in all research areas listed above, and the proposal must clearly define how the team will work together to achieve the program goals. One of the team members must be designated the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for coordinating the team and demonstrating the project milestones.

Proposals that address only a subset of the research areas listed above or do not contain a clear indication of the Principal Investigator and Management Approach will not be considered for funding.

The technical volume of the research proposal must consist of the following sections:
1)	Technical Approach
a.	Methods for producing optical lattices with geometry relevant to the chosen Hamiltonian.
b.	Technique for producing degenerate quantum gases and loading them into the optical lattices with control appropriate for the chosen Hamiltonian.
c.	Techniques for engineering the chosen Hamiltonian in the Optical Lattice Emulator, including control of interactions, atom distribution within the lattice, temperature, etc.
d.	Techniques for measuring and characterizing the engineered Hamiltonian in the Optical Lattice Emulator.
e.	A table showing the time required to produce the experimentally generated phase space diagram. This should address a time budget for all of the stages outlined above, clearly state any assumptions, and an estimate for the impact measurement signal to noise has on total emulation time. An example of such a calculation will be made available at the Proposer?s Day Workshop discussed below.
2)	Research Team: Clearly define the expertise of the individual team members and how their expertise relates to the research areas defined in the technical approach.
3)	Management Approach: Define a single Principal Investigator who will coordinate the team and be responsible for demonstrating the Go/No-Go project milestones listed below.
4)	Phase I milestones: 
a.	End of Phase I (Go/No-Go) milestones: The Go/No-Go milestones must include those outlined above for the Phase I program, and must be clearly and explicitly stated.
b.	Interim Phase I progress assessments: A list of smaller project accomplishments that must occur to meet the Go/No-Go milestone should be listed. These should be time-ordered (to the extent possible), and a lead researcher must be identified as responsible for that accomplishment.
5)	Phase II Phenomena Demonstrations: Discuss a plan for extending the Phase I OLE tool beyond the validation by benchmark Hamiltonian.  In particular, 
a.	Outline the particular phase behavior(s) that will serve as the principle OLE tool demonstration(s), and how this (each) demonstration might be used to guide a follow-on experimental material development project.  
b.	Discuss the means for verifying measurements made in the OLE tool for each of the above phase behaviors.
c.	Each OLE phase investigation should form its own task, and must be broken out separately in the Cost Volume. Note we are not asking for the proposal to actually explore material designs, but rather to provide a realizable approach for using their tool to do so.

A Proposer?s Day Workshop will be held on December 5, 2006, in Arlington, Virginia. This workshop will serve as a forum to present the program vision and goals, go over representative calculations and desired performance characteristics, and present possible challenge problems for the OLE program. Further, this workshop will provide an opportunity for those interested in proposing to seek clarification on the proposal and partnerships critical to programmatic success. A full Special Announcement (SN07-04) detailing meeting purpose, location, registration, and other information can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application.

<DESC>Below are answers to questions received by Robin Wong (GSA) prior to October 6, 2006.

1. The modification posted Sept. 12, 2006 identifies a change in Point of Contact to Gregory McSweeny, yet the latest posting still refers to Lilia West as the Point of Contact. Which is the correct contact for sending our submittal?
All submittals should be sent to the attention of Mr. Gregory McSweeny. Please send submittals to the following address:
General Services Administration
Property Development Division
Attn: Mr. Gregory McSweeny
450 Golden Gate Ave., 3rd Floor West
San Francisco, CA 94102

Please be advised that Ms. Lilia West is no longer the Point of Contact for this project, contrary to what is stated at the foot of each posting. Please direct all questions or concerns via e-mail to Ms. Robin Wong at robin.wong@gsa.gov 

2. In the Responses to Non-technical Questions (posted Sept. 20, 2006), Question 6 states that projects submitted for the Past Performance requirement must be complete and dated within the last 10 years (clearly excluding work presently under construction and pre-construction). Does the same criterion apply for the projects submitted as part of the Lead Designer Portfolio (i.e. only projects COMPLETED during the last 10 years)?
As stated in the original Synopsis: If the Lead Designer is "a single designer, submit a Portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). If the Lead Designer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each Lead Designer or Lead Design Discipline." Completed projects, for the interest of the Lead Designer Portfolio, include projects where the design is complete. 

3. Will the Small Business Outreach meeting with the short-listed firms be on November 7th, location TBA, or October 26th like it says on FedBizOpps?  
The Small Business Outreach is currently scheduled for November 7th, 2006 (subject to change), location and time TBA.  Please continue checking FedBizOpps for updated information regarding the date, time, and place for this event.

4.  This question is in reference to a slide contained in the Powerpoint Presentation displayed at the Pre-submittal Conference. The slide read:

* Office = 470,000 gsf 
* Parking = 510 cars 

Is this a ballpark estimate of the project program (new and existing)?  Please confirm.
Yes, the above is a ballpark estimate of the project program (new and existing) and is subject to change. Please be reminded that the Powerpoint presentation, as well as other materials presented at the Pre-submittal Conference, were posted on FedBizOpps on Sept. 20, 2006.

5.  In the Stage I submittal, can the Lead Designer (team) consist of 2 firms (architectural) to show a combination of projects? If yes, do we need to identify that they are 2 firms in the stage one submittal, or would we identify that in the Stage II submittal?
As stated in the original Synopsis, the A/E firm may include a partnership of 2 firms. However, the Lead Designer must be an individual, pair, or group that will lead the design for this project. Any declaration of a partnership should be made in Stage I. Please refer to the original Synopsis for more details.

6. Who is conducting a Program Development Study (PDS) for this project?
At the Pre-submittal Conference held on Sept. 14, 2006 in San Diego, GSA indicated that Louis Berger Group and Performa, Inc. were performing the PDS for this project. No further information regarding the PDS or PDS contractor will be released at this time. The information generated by the PDS contractor will be forwarded to the short-listed firms in Stage II.

<CONTACT>Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, Phone (513) 487-2092, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email tharp.scott@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, 2890 Woodbridge Avenue, Edison, New Jersey, requires paving for the Urban Watershed Research Facility (UWRF).  Several different types of pavement are required.  Pavement type will be a mix of porous pavement (block and poured), hot mix asphalt (HMA) and paver stones.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the project.  The project consists of two objectives:  (A) Connect parking lot and laboratories to the road leading up to the UWRF.   (B) Allow the evaluation of porous pavement as a method of stormwater treatment and volume control. The Contractor shall:  (1) Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the required pavements can be installed.  Approximately 3700 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of the area.  Grading and trenching shall adhere to current grade.  A 65 ft long, 2 ft wide trench shall be required for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  This trench shall carry piping and will be back-filled with pea gravel and capped with concrete block as described in the next section on porous pavement.   (2) Pave approximately 1560 sq ft with Porous Pavement.  Four separate segments shall be constructed with separate drainage for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  Two concrete treatments shall be used, blocks and poured pavement, each with two sections.  Each section shall measure 30 by 12 ft and be lined with an impermeable liner and a 2 in. diameter drainage pipe (HDPE 80) heat sealed to the liner.  The liner shall be puncture resistant, minimum of 6 mil thickness, and ideally should completely cover each section and sides to surface (15 ft by 35 ft).  The pipes shall be placed on top of liner and heat sealed at each end (four heat seals in all).  Drainage pipes shall be provided by EPA.   (3) A 10 ft wide and 140 ft. long vehicle access run of a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) strip is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be as straight as possible given the layout of the facility and the requirements for the porous pavement above.  This asphalt strip should abut the new porous pavement. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  An additional 10 by 60 ft and 10 by 12 ft section is anticipated.  Total estimated area of coverage is 2120 sq ft.   (4) The contractor shall provide five walkways connecting buildings to the new asphalt strip.  The location will be from the greenhouse, laboratory trailers, walk-in freezer, and high bay.  The width of walkway runs should match with access ways and doors.  The most economical method for walkway construction may be used.  However, a portion (10% to 33%) of these walkways for this task is required to be rubber sidewalks made from recycled tires.  These strips of recycled tires are anticipated to sit on a base material 2 to 4 inches thick with an impermeable liner beneath and are estimated to be 3 times as costly as concrete walkways.  Piping for drainage and monitoring will be provided.  The upper estimate of total walkway coverage is 250 sq ft.   Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. Acceptance of the overall project will be by Contractor demonstration the installed Porous Pavement System performs as required by the objectives of this project.   A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Three (3) evaluation factors will be used: Technical Expertise, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Expertise and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price.  The anticipated contract performance period is 60 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, and site visit information, will be released through the internet on the Fedbizopps website.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 15 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

AMENDMENTS 3 AND 4 HAVE BEEN POSTED FOR THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  REVIEW THE FILES UPLOADED ON 20 OCT 2006 AND 1 NOV 2006 FOR DETAILS REGARDING THESE AMENDMENTS.  NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED FOR THIS NOTICE.

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is ?541380?.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06
	2.  Questions from Contractor	s				25 April ? 12 May 06

Background:

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conducting research on treatment, prevention, diagno?sis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating Center, which encompasses both clinical trials on the treatment and management of HIV infection in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women domestically and internationally, including infrastructure development as well as clinical trials. The Coordinating Center contract currently encompasses several inter-related projects: the NICHD Network of clinical trials sites; the Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI); a trial of post-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-exposed infants (NICHD/HPTN 040 Trial); the India Perinatal Project; and site monitoring for phase III investigator-initiated clinical trials.

Scope of activities:

Current activities conducted within the Coordinating Center contract include the following:

	NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network

The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (NICHD Network) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.  The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.  The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) and Adult ACTG funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 20 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are six international clinical trials sites: five sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in the Bahamas.    NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.  The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.  The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.  

	Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative 

Through the experience of the NICHD Network with directly opening antiretroviral drug treatment trials in sites in Brazil and Bahamas in 1998 and 1999, NICHD identified a need for further training and development to increase Latin American and Caribbean capacity for the conduct of clinical trials, particularly those involving experimental drugs.  During 2000, NICHD and Coordinating Center began the NICHD International Site Development Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean (NISDI) to address this need.  NISDI is designed to provide capacity-building and training to international sites through the conduct of two observational studies: one in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants; and the other in HIV-exposed, but uninfected infants and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents. The goal of this initiative is to train investigators and develop sites that will be able to participate in future international prevention and treatment trials. The Coordinating Center currently subcontracts with 25 sites in six countries participating in the protocols from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Bahamas, Jamaica and Peru.  As of July 2006 there were 1,136 pregnant women and 1,522 pediatric patients enrolled into their respective protocols.  

	Clinical Trial of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV-Exposed Infants in Latin America and the U.S.

NICHD, through the Coordinating Center contract, is conducting a study to evaluate the efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis provided only to the infant in situations in which the mother has not received any antiretroviral therapy prior to delivery.  This includes women who are first identified as HIV-infected during labor, and therefore are unable to receive antepartum or intrapartum prophylaxis. This study compares three different types of post-exposure prophylaxis in such infants standard zidovudine for six weeks to the infant (standard in Brazil and U.S.); a combination of zidovudine with nevirapine; and a triple combination of zidovudine, nevirapine and nelfinavir.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for all aspects of clinical trials management, including protocol and forms design, drug repository and dispensation, regulatory issues, data management and data analysis.  Participating sites include 6 sites in the US, 8 sites in Brazil, 1 site in Argentina, and 1 site in South Africa in Johannesburg with a second site in Cape Town about to open.  

	India Perinatal Initiative 

Collaboration with investigators in southern India on a perinatal HIV prevention project was initiated in late 2000, entitled "An observational study of the seroprevalence of, and interventions to decrease the risk of maternal to child transmission of HIV in Tamil Nadu, India".  During Stage I of the study, all pregnant women registered in the antenatal clinics were offered the opportunity to participate in an educational session about HIV infection and transmission. Pre- and post-session assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were administered to a random sample of women.  Voluntary counseling and HIV testing were offered to all women, and the seroprevalence rated was estimated.  Enrollment into this part of the protocol took place between December 2003 and December 2004.   During Stage II, those women identified as HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a prospective cohort study and offered antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother to child transmission (initially zidovudine, then zidovudine plus single-dose nevirapine).  Enrollment into this part of the protocol began in early 2004, and the final subject study visits were completed in May 2006.    It is anticipated that close-out of sites, analyses and laboratory testing of stored samples from this study will continue into the new Coordinating Center project period.

	Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials

As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety.  The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct.  The Coordinating Center is currently performing site monitoring for the NICHD-funded NEVEREST (Nevirapine Resistance Study) trial evaluating response to therapy in women and children exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother to child transmission being conducted in South Africa.   

Technical requirements  

To be deemed capable to serve the Coordinating Center, a Small Business Concern must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability of the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to implement, maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers to conduct current and future clinical trials for evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations.    This includes:

	Providing personnel, facilities, and other services necessary to maintain and coordinate clinical treatment, prevention, natural history, epidemiologic, and diagnostic research studies at participating centers of studies conducted within the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Studies Coordinating Center contract.

<DESC>Amendment 0003 to Solicitation W15QKN-07-R-0300 The purpose of this amendment is to Answer Questions and clarifications from potential offerorâ€™s. Question: Para C.3.4.1.1 Says there's supposed to be a kick-off meeting at ARDEC; however, it says it's to include a manufacturing facilities tour.  Is the facility tour of the Adelphi facility that is producing the first 100 units? Answer: â€œThe contractor shall conduct a kick-off meeting at the ARDEC Fuze Divisionâ€™s EPIAFS workplace (Adelphi, MD) within 30 days of contract award.â€ This is a government facility in Adelphi, MD.  Currently the qualification units are being produced at this facility. Question: Clause 52.217-7 says that they can exercise an option to increase the quantity up until 30 days prior to final delivery and expect continuous delivery at the previous rate. Answer: Correction to Clause 52.217-7 of solicitation should read: The Government may require the delivery of the numbered line item, identified in the Schedule as an option item, in the quantity and at the price stated in the Schedule.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor no later than 60 days prior to Final Delivery.  The Government may exercise each option one or more times during the time period, provided that the total quantity shall not exceed the highest quantity of the maximum range for that option.  Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree. (Please Note: This is not an evaluation factor for this solicitation.) Question:  Section H, Specialty Metals, DFARS Clause 252.225-7014 Preference for Domestic Specialty Metals (Jun 2005); Company requests an Exemption. Answer: DFARS Clause 252.225-7014 is Not Applicable to deliveries of the EPIAFS System at this time.  The EPIAFS System is in support of contingency operations and therefore is not subject these restrictions.  Should this category change in the future, full compliance will be necessary. Question: Regarding Pricing Models; we recommend that a redetermination provision be added to assure that unit prices are keeping up with economic conditions. Answer: The Economic Price Adjustment Model will not be added to this contract. Question: Provide us with a copy of the following Specs DTL 13001075 and acceptance document AD13001075. Answer: DTL 13001075 is already included in the TDP.  Please contact Contract Specialist for this Solicitation for an electronic copy of document AD13001075.  This is not a Qualified Item; item is produced to drawing specification.  This is not a Directed Source, but the following company has produced this item; SAVT Corp, 1130 Route 46 West, Parsippany, NJ 07054 POC: Mr. Warren Reiner Telephone: 973-263-3080. Question: Clarify the comments under Section B specifically with each CLIN regarding the "One Lot consists of 10 EPIAFS Systems"; what does this mean when ordering range quantities exceeding 10. Answer: â€œOne Lot of 10 EPIAFS Systemsâ€ refers only to CLINs for First Article Testing. Question: Clarify where will FAT be done?  Paragraph C.3.8.3 of the SOW says that FAT will be at the contractor's plant or an independent test lab proposed by the contractor.  However, under ARDEC 39 on page 22, the RFP says that FAT will be done at ARDEC.  Where will FAT be done? Answer: FAT could either be conducted at the contractorâ€™s facility or an independent test lab proposed by the contractor.  Government personnel will oversee FAT regardless of location.  Correction ARDEC 39 of solicitation should read: â€œThe First Article shall be delivered to either the contractorâ€™s facility or an independent test lab proposed by the contractor.â€ Question: The RFP does not seem to identify any test equipment to simulate the Excalibur round to prove that the round can be set by the EPIAFS.  Is that an oversight?  Is there additional GFE to be provided for that function? Answer: The test equ

<SUBJECT>99 -- GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM - AIR FORCE (GCSS-AF) ENTERPRISE DATA COLLECTION LAYER (EDCL)
<SOLNBR>07-0001
<RESPDATE>112006
<ARCHDATE>02012007
<CONTACT>John Whitaker, AF AIT PMO Project Manager, 937-904-0327
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of commercial off the shelf (COTS) products that support an Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL) solution to communications between Automated Data Collection (ADC) and legacy logistics systems and an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  These products must have a viable commercial presence in industry and should be in use in applications similar to the planned Air Force use. This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for preparation or submittal of information in response to this RFI.  In addition, the Government will not pay for any costs associated with participation in subsequent demonstrations. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The Air Force Automated Identification Technologies Program Management Office (AF AIT PMO) and the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Program is researching potential solutions for the integration and management of data collected from Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) devices.  The research is focused on the capabilities of commercial products that support an enterprise data collection concept and learning about industry-leading vendors of such products.  The Air Force is establishing an Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) architecture that will provide an effective transfer of data from automated data collection (ADC) capabilities to legacy systems and subsequently the Air Force Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  The architecture will enable use of the full range of AITs including, but not limited to: linear bar codes, two-dimensional bar codes, passive RFID tags, active RFID tags, contact memory buttons as well as specific AIT devices (wireless hand held terminals, printers, RFID portals, light stacks, and motion sensors). Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL) solutions provide the critical software infrastructure layer that resides between the data collection devices at the point of logistics events and the back-end automated information systems (AISs) and enterprise data repositories.  EDCL tools manage the communications between ADC devices, networked systems, data, and processes, enabling real-time information and event management.   The Air Force EDCL is expected to: .Enable use of the full range of Air Force AITs; .Integrate with the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) architecture as a standard AIT architecture and device manager accessible to the AIT development and implementation community; .Efficiently manage AIT enabled volumes of data flowing through Air Force networks; .Support configurable data transformation and routing to legacy systems and the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS), an Oracle ERP based system; and .Support implementation of business rules in device and event management layers versus legacy information systems. To accomplish this exploration, the AF AIT PMO and GCSS-AF is requesting information from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) vendors leading to demonstrations with AF participants. TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION:  the AF AIT PMO and GCSS-AF will conduct market analysis by reviewing vendor submitted EDCL Capabilities Description documents. Content requirements and specifications are described below in the EDCL CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION CONTENT section. Any information submitted by respondents to this request for information is strictly voluntary and will be used only for the purpose of this analysis.  Proprietary and Confidential Information will not be accepted.  The GCSS-AF Program believes that standard specifications and capabilities should be sufficient to respond.  If a vendor believes that their response must include proprietary or confidential information in order to be properly considered, they should notify the contact listed below. If applicable, a set of COTS products may be described by a team of COTS vendors to provide fuller coverage of the requested information as detailed in the EDCL Capabilities Description.   PARTIES INTERESTED IN SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO THIS RFI MUST SUBMIT A NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT VIA EMAIL TO - TAMI RICE, TRICE@NCIINC.COM, NLT 1700 EDT 9 NOV 2006.  FULL RESPONSES ARE DUE NLT 1700 EDT 20 NOV 2006 VIA EMAIL TO TRICE@NCIINC.COM CONSISTING OF A ZIP FILE CONTAINING THE COMPLETED EDCL CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION DOCUMENT. All questions should be submitted via email to Tami Rice, trice@nciinc.com in accordance with the schedule below.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract, for the possession/retention of existing furniture and equipment, which has been apart of an existing capitated lease agreement, for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Community Based Outpatient Clinic, that has been contractor operated and staffed, by MedMark Services, Inc., of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.   Based upon the research conducted, the requirement is of an urgent and compelling nature, due to efforts to meet the scheduled transition date of December 1, 2006 for the conversion and transition of the facility from contractor operated/staffed, to a VA operated and staffed facility. MedMark Services, Inc. of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois offers to the VA, a proposal to retain the attached list of furnishings and equipment, at a value substantially less than the projected cost, the VA would expect to incur, if otherwise procured from the commercial market place, to furnish equal items, alike items, or brand new items.  Additionally, because the items are already in place, this avoids any need for shipping, assembly, or startup, thus, allowing for a seamless transition of the facilities operations and functionality. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 621111.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the most practical and cost effective manner to meet the scheduled date and acquire the items necessary for the transitional process and operations of our soon to be VA operated and staffed, Community Based Outpatient Clinic, in Oak Lawn, Illinois.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within eight (8) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC-GLAC, Building 5, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with MedMark Services, Inc., of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command has a requirement for a replacement system to replace the current Naval Working Capital Fund (NWCF) Budget System, which includes interfaces with the Navy?s other financial systems.  The Navy is soliciting information from interested parties that have the requisite technical capability to provide/develop the replacement system.  It is requested that interested parties provide their interest and statement of technical capability by 4 December 2006, with a rough order of magnitude for the costs of the replacement system, but may exclude interfaces (and associated costs), which will be addressed in the solicitation expected to be issued by late spring 2007.  The interested party may verify that the government has received the contractor submitted information by contacting Contract Specialist Naomi Melendez at telephone 202-685-8051.  See the end of this announcement.  Background:  The Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) is a revolving fund, an account or fund that relies on sales revenue rather than direct Congressional appropriations to finance its operations.  The basic concept of the working capital funds is quite simple.  A cash account (corpus) is established and used to initially finance the costs of producing goods or services.  The proceeds of the ?sale? are then re-deposited into the cash account and become available to finance additional goods and services.  The intent of NWCF is to generate adequate revenue to cover the full costs of its operations, and to finance the fund?s continuing operations without fiscal year limitation.  A revolving fund is intended to operate on a break-even basis over time; that is, it neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss.  NWCF activities perform various functions, including supply management, depot maintenance, research and development, transportation, and base support.  This is accomplished by identifying all costs associated with providing goods or services and establishing a ?rate? to charge the customer. Base Support is overseen by Facilities Engineering Commands (FECs) worldwide and includes the Public Works (PWs) and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC).  The PW business lines provide utilities services, facilities maintenance, and transportation support required by operating forces and other activities.  NFESC provide specialized facilities, engineering, and technology support. Purpose: The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to determine the availability and functionality of a potential NWCF budgetary system to support the FECs.  Mission:  To provide single source of authoritative, relevant and accurate budget information. Objective:  To provide a single integrated web based budget system for the modernization and upgrade of the budgetary information systems to improve analysis and decision support within NAVFAC applying the NWCF components (listed below) and to establish billing rates.  NWCF Components (Functional): Budget Flow, Civilian Personnel Labor Process, Capital Procurement Program (CPP) and Depreciation Budget, Commodity Predetermined Budget, Reports (Output)/Navy Exhibits, Budget Startup, Internal Sales/Inter-Utility Transfers,  Rate Setting and AOR Recovery, Expense, Overhead Budget & Flexibilities, Supporting Documents, Historical Data Trends, Budget Roll Up Levels, External/Internal Link Interfaces to include possible overseas links.  Other Requirements: Resource Allocation Process (RAP),  Enterprise planning and budgeting tool, An application for planning, budgeting, reporting, and analysis, Scalable and web-based, Sophisticated data modeling and multi-dimensional analysis, Tailored for customer?s own business processes, Standard reports and graphs, Ad hoc analysis, Sharing of drivers, models, and calculations,  Integration of data from multiple sources, Business calculation templates, Analysis of trends and variances, Business processes are transparent, repeatable, and automated, Reduce cycle time for planning and budgeting, Planning process can drive budgetary control and respond to strategic applications, Enforce corporate control while allowing decentralization, Generate the worksheets automatically, Monitor who has submitted and who hasn?t, Minimize administration, Use tools to spread yearly totals to the months (phasing), Use tools to recalculate metrics, Validate the budget against targets, Speed the formulation of budgets, Create what-if analyses, Cascade the worksheet to those who report to you, Extend the model for capturing information, One report is shared with many users, Each user only sees the data they are allowed to see, Data security with easy administration.  Interested parties may express their interest by calling Naomi Melendez at 202-685-8051 and/or submitting information to fax number 202-685-7088 or the following email address:  naomi.melendez@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a Source Sought Synopsis only. NASA/JSC is seeking capabilities information from certified 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns within a five (5) state region consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas for Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract(s) for General Construction at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Ellington Field (EF), and Sonny Carter Training Facility (SCTF). The purpose is to determine the appropriate level of competition in accordance with FAR 19.10 Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement as an 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSB set-aside. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  It is anticipated that NASA/JSC will issue a solicitation for IDIQ Contract(s) for General Construction at JSC, EF, and SCTF, in which, a sample Delivery Order may be used for selection purposes. The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220 and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The minimum award value is anticipated to be $5,000 with a maximum Not to Exceed (NTE) value of $36,000,000 over a 5 year period of performance.  Certified 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB General Construction Companies capable of performing as prime contractors that meet the requirements of this synopsis are asked to submit capability statements in no more than seven (7) pages.	Capability statements must include the following information: •	Name and address of firm •	Size of business •	Average annual revenue for past 3 years •	Number of employees •	Ownership •	Indicate company status as either Certified 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB •	Number of years in business •	Affiliate information:	parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, etc… In addition, capability statements must address the following:  1) Capability statements should identify past projects with proven General Construction experience with emphasis on work performed on a Federal installation and include three (3) references.  These references must highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, a point of contact - address and phone numbers. 2) Ability to meet the 15% requirement of work to be performed by the prime contractor, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees as set forth in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Provide examples of three (3) past projects with emphasis on work performed on a Federal installation where the potential offeror has performed 15% or greater of the effort for projects ranging from a magnitude of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The provided examples are to indicate that the potential offeror is capable of performing the primary and vital functions of the contract in accordance with the Ostensible Subcontractor Rule, 13 C.F.R. 121.103(h)(4)(2005).  NOTE:  Projects that satisfy the requirements of both items 1 and 2 of the synopsis only need to be submitted once. 3) Identify any OSHA violations within the last 3 years, specifically injury or death related. Also provide disposition of any OSHA violations.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting abstracts relating to the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection, and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Block 20 program (RB-20).  RB-20 was previously referred to as the RAIDRS Spiral 2 (RS-2) program.

As funded in the Future Year Defense Program (FYDP), RB-20 is currently in its Concept Development Phase.  The overall program objective is to provide Defensive Counterspace (DCS) situation awareness of attacks (e.g. on-orbit or other) designed to deny or disrupt one or more U.S. space asset(s).  The RB-20 system will encompass the full spectrum of inputs from intelligence reporting and forecasting to direct technical "feeds" from highly varied space and other assets.  From these inputs, the RB-20 system will provide DCS situation awareness, indicate, characterize, and attribute space asset attacks and provide options for countering and responding to the exposed threat(s). 

RAIDRS Block 20 will be acquired in an evolutionary acquisition approach where the end-state described above will be the guidepost for technology, operational, and integration efforts leading to the comprehensive DCS situation awareness capability.  The Preliminary Design Phase of RB-20 is planned to begin in Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.

In preparation for the Preliminary Design Phase, SYSW intends to engage industry with information and is planning to award one or more Concept Development contracts in mid-FY 2007.  The focus of these contracts will be to (1) analyze and propose system-level requirements based on the draft Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and draft Enabling Concept (EC) and (2) document findings as inputs to the draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD).  To facilitate FY07 acquisition activities, the RB-20 Industry Day is scheduled for 28 November 2006 from 0800 - 1200 at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  At this Industry Day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the goals and potential strategies for acquiring the RB-20 system.  

As part of program concept development, SYSW requests abstracts from industry partners.  The abstracts should address the preparing company's experience and lessons learned from particular programs including Defensive Counterspace and Space Situation Awareness, data fusion, decision support, command and control, and any other activity where data sources or data fusion techniques can be derived for defense of space assets.  The principle thrust of the abstracts should be the company?s ideas (proprietary or not) on how to architect, develop, test, operate and continuously upgrade a robust DCS situation awareness engine.  Abstracts shall be no more than 12 pages and submitted no later than 17 Nov 06.  Submission of an abstract is not a prerequisite for participation at the Industry Day open session.  Classified abstracts up to TS/SCI (no SAP/SAR) shall be submitted via classified fax to (310) 416-1704 or 1705, Attention: Berta Chavez.  Unclassified abstracts shall be faxed to (310) 416-1746, Attention: Capt Berton Manning or mail to Capt Berton Manning, SYDS, 483 N Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2088.

As part of Industry Day, the RB-20 project team will conduct one-on-one discussions up to the TS/SCI level.  Each one-on-one session will be limited to 45 minutes and will be limited to four (4) individuals per contractor team.  Those contractors who desire to reserve a one-on-one session at the Industry Day must submit an abstract, as described above.  These abstracts will be kept strictly confidential and within proprietary information channels.  

Attendees must be U.S. citizens and must possess a DoD Final SECRET security clearance to attend this Industry Day.  Fax Visit Certifications (validating citizenship and clearance) to SYSW/AS 483 N. Aviation Blvd. Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245 Attn: Berta Chavez FAX # (310) 416-1746.  Purpose:  RB-20 Industry Day, Technical POC: Capt Berton Manning/Pam Hart (310) 416-1713.  If SCI is required to present your abstract during the one-on-one session, SCI visit certifications shall be sent via JPAS to SMO Code SYSW Attention Steve Taylor or through your supporting SSO to SSO SMC//INS// with passing instruction to SYSW/AS Stephen Taylor 310-416-1518 or Pam Hart (310) 416-1713. ALL clearances MUST be received NLT 15 Nov 06.

The release of this RFI affords industry the opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments.  The Government's purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative.  The Government believes industry feedback is important.  The Government is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI, are industry standards, and describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years.  What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques?  Describe your experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts.

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS.  The Government is interested in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware and software maintenance support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).  Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics.  Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.

Questions to the Government may be included under separate cover for all submissions.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 708th Armament Systems Group, Eglin AFB FL, is planning an acquisition strategy for the follow on production of the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) for production lots 12 thru 17.  If any potential offeror feels they can meet the requirements outlined below, they should deliver a Statement of Capabilities in accordance with Numbered Note 25 specifically defining their capabilities. 

The JDAM is a low cost, GPS aided, inertial guidance kit for inventory 500 lb., 1000 lb., and 2000 lb. bombs.  The total quantities to be procured are to replace units used in test, training and operations.  The objectives of the JDAM Lot 12-17 production program are to fabricate a high quality JDAM weapon system that performs in accordance with the draft System Requirements Document (SRD) and is fully integrated and qualified for employment from the aircraft identified in the SRD.  The following delivery schedule must be met or exceeded; Contract Award - Oct 2007, first delivery of fully qualified production units - NLT March 2009.  An estimated 5,317 tail kits are required in Lot 12 with an estimated FY08 budget of $119.1M.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students.

The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries.  The cross-sectional international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students.  The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.

The U.S. longitudinal survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions.

Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care.  
            
The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to: 1)  develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts at state and local departments of education and school districts to gain access to schools for surveys;  3)  identify and recruit in a period of 4 months two national samples of middle and high schools, one involving > 15000 students and > 400 schools (representing a national probability sample from which the total of 5000 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 year-old  students for the HBSC sub-sample will be drawn) with an 80% rate of participation, and a second national sample of > 6000 11- and 15-year-old students meeting the same criteria as the cross-sectional sample;  4) identify, establish, and maintain a national network of data collectors; 5) recruit, train, and manage data collectors working in locations dispersed across the country; 6) conduct a national school-based survey involving >15000 students and >400 schools; 7) conduct a 4-year longitudinal assessment of >6000 11- and 15-year-old students that may include both in-school and at-home assessments; 7) employ SUDAN or similar statistical programs for basic management of weighted cross-sectional samples; 8) manage large data sets with students nested within schools; 9) prepare data summaries and preliminary analyses; and 10) prepare public use data sets. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates the number of employees. 

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Elizabeth Osinski at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Thursday, November 16, 2006. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. See Numbered Note 25. No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. All in terested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to solicitation announcements at a later time. This notice is to assist the Baltimore District, Corps of Engineers in determining potential sources and to obtain industry comment on a proposed draft Re quest for Proposals.  This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.    Point of Contact Comments are to be sent either via email to famane.c.brown@usace.army.mil or by hard copy to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 10 S. Howard Street, Suite 7000, Baltimore MD 21201-1715 no later than 4:30 p.m. eastern standard time November 20th  , 2006.  NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.**  Project Description** This is a BRAC 2005 action.  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) plans to consolidate operations from its current locations throughout the National Capital Region (NCR) to a stand-alone campus (East Campus) tentatively planned to be located a t Engineer Proving Ground, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The NGA Campus must accommodate phased occupancy with an eventual goal to accommodate a total of approximately 2,419,000 gross square feet (gsf) of development on a site of approximately 200 acres at of the Engineer Proving Ground of Ft. Belvoir.   The facility is in the early stages of design.  Development may include:  Office and Amenity Spaces - 1,500,000 gsf; Data Center with stand-alone Central Utility Plant - 180,000 gsf; Central Utility Plant  50,000 gsf; 10 MW power generation facility; Remo te Inspection Facility  40,000 gsf; Structured Parking  5,100 spaces; campus roads with a 4-lane bridge over Accotink Creek; conference facilities; access control and visitors center; and supporting utilities and infrastructure. Construction will be incrementally funded from 2007 through 2011.  Construction and occupancy of the NGA East Campus will occur in a phased manner.  The BRAC 2005 legislation requires that this action must be complete by September 15, 2011 (including const ruction, fit-out, and moving, and lease termination/turnover of vacated facilities).  In addition, due to the need to maintain continuity of operations, NGA requires completion of the first phase by June 2009.  The first phase will include, but not be limi ted to, a 180,000 gross square foot data center shell, including standalone central utility plant, with fit-out completed for 22,000 square feet of this space. The NAICS Code is 236220 with a size standard of $31,000,000.  Estimated construction cost of work under this procurement is estimated to be in excess of $1,000,000,000.   Construction is planned to begin when all required environmental approvals are received, currently expected to be summer of 2007.  The Government is proposing to utilize a two-step (FAR PART 37), best-value approach to competitively select a prime contractor.  The scope of the contract will potentially  include both pre-construction services during design, and construction services.  In many respects, the resulting acquisition will be similar to a CM at Risk or GMP contract utilized in private sector contracting.  However, the proposed contract will utilize the FAR clause 52.216-17, Incentive Price Revision  Successive Targets (Oct 1997). Instructions to Respondents to this Sources Sought announcement There are four draft documents attached to this announcement:(PLEASE REQUEST BY E-MAIL FROM FAMANE C. BROWN. Section 00010  Schedule of Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs;  Section 01010  Scope of Work;  Section 00100  Proposal Submission Requirements;  52.216-17 -- Incentive Price Revision -- Successive Targets. As prescribed in 16.406(b), insert the following clause: Incentive Price Revision -- Successive Targets (Oct 1997)** Request comments concerning the above four draft documents.  It is not the governments intent to provide the complete solicitation for comment.  The formal solicitation will include site master planning documents, and in step two of the two step process, schematic design documents will be issued as a basis for price proposals. Request comments on the overall contracting plan as outlined in the draft documents as well as comments on specifics of the submission requirements and other issues affecting the construction.  Also request input on the following specific issues: a. What benefits would the project realize by including a contract clause for economic price adjustment (In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Section 16.203) in final construction contracts?  What elements would this adjustment most effectivel y apply to? b.  How could the government best apply incentives to this work? c.  What issues should the government consider in phasing and contracting the construction in the most efficient manner? d.  Assuming a 200 acre site, and assuming the majority of facilities in this development are contained in a single building with a footprint of about 1,600,000 gsf, phased fast-track construction, and phased occupancy starting in Jun 2009, what is the max imum dollar value of construction you could complete in one year?  What total duration for construction would you estimate is required to complete this effort?  Assume a typical work schedule and sufficient funding. e.  What can the government do to make it easier to get:       1)  Bonding?       2)  Sufficient manpower on site when needed?       3)  Sufficient material/equipment on site when needed?       3)  Onto and off-of Engineer Proving Ground, Fort Belvoir, VA? Comments will be shared with the government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. Offerors submitting comments may also request to discuss their comments directly with the government.  Discussion slots will be limited to offerors submitting comments and planning to serve in a contractor (prime, sub or construction manager) capacity and major industry associations such as AGC, CMA, and AIA.  Suppliers and other interested parties may submit comments and may be part of a construction team; however, the option for individual discussion slots will not be made available to them.  These discus sions are planned to be with each offeror team individually, however the government reserves the right to conduct discussions in groups if necessary based on the number of offerors involved.   Comments may be in a format as chosen by each offeror, but must include the offerors name, point of contact, planned role on the project, socio-economic status, projected bonding capacity and whether or not a discussion session is requested. In preparing the formal solicitation, the government makes no commitment to retain any of the elements/provisions of this draft solicitation and may include different elements/provisions in the formal solicitation.

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Optical Lattice Emulator (OLE), DARPA is hosting a Proposer?s Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to BAA06-19, Addendum 7. The workshop will be held on December 5, 2006, in Arlington, Virginia. 

The goals and milestones of the DARPA Optical Lattice Emulator program are specified in the Broad Agency Announcement, BAA06-19, Addendum 7. A highly interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort and meet the Phase I milestones. The Proposer's Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the open Broad Agency Announcement. 

The teaming and information session will be held at The Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd Suite 600, Arlington, VA, on December 5, 2006. The goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the Optical Lattice Emulator (OLE) program vision and goals; (b) go over representative performance calculations and present possible challenge problems for the OLE program; and (c) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential research organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the OLE program goals.

<SUBJECT>99 -- OPM Leadership Assessment Center
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a sole-source award that will result in multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to Embassy Suites Hotels within the Washington, DC metropolitan area to provide suite style hotel space for the OPM Leadership Assessment Center. The BPAs will be for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.  The OPM Leadership Assessment Center is typically conducted for various federal agencies approximately six (6) times per year.  The authority for the sole source is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Assessment center administration requires a very specific room configuration. When conducting an assessment center, a common professional practice is to rent hotel space that meets the necessary configuration requirements (typically a suite style room so the sleeping area can be separated by a closed door and the outer room can be reconfigured to simulate office space.)  The timing of all activities during the assessment day is very tightly controlled; therefore, it is necessary to provide box lunches for all participants and staff to ensure that all activities remain on schedule. Timing and consistency are key elements in the legal defensibility of the assessment process.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAR SUBPART 5.2. THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT. Therefore, no solicitation document is available.  

The OPM has utilized other vendor spaces in the past. However, no other hotels in the DC metropolitan area can effectively meet the strict needs of this requirement with respect to space configuration and location of facilities near a Metrorail station or a major airport. The OPM intends to issue a competitive procurement for this requirement in the future (during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007) should it be definitively determined that other responsible sources in the Washington, DC metropolitan area can accommodate the needs of this requirement.  If you feel that your company has the capability to meet this requirement, please forward a capability statement to Patricia Broome at patricia.broome@opm.gov.  Interested sources should ensure that they are registered on the Federal Business Opportunities website under the applicable NAICS code to receive notification when the Request for Proposal is issued.

The U S A rmy Corps of Engineers has been pilot testing a biotechnology known as the periphyton stormwater treatment area to achieve greater phosphorus reduction.  The STA-1E Demonstration Project includes operating Cells 1 and 2 at differing hydraulic loading rates  and differing hydraulic retention times in differing types of substrate.  The field demonstration is to be conducted over a 24-month operation period and will be used to determine the optimum design parameters, operational parameters, and recommendations for full-scale implementation of PSTA for STA-1E.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541690 and the size standard is $6.5 Million. 	The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills, and expertise possessed by Dr. Ronald Jones, sole proprietor of RDJ Consulting, LLC.

Clothing layers must:  physically integrate together and with other combat gear, be durable to the rigors of military use and multiple home and commercial laundering.    While fabrics and construction must be durable and protective, they must also enable excess body heat to escape to avoid overheating, be lightweight, highly packable, and fast drying. Finally, products must also be 100% Berry Amendment compliant.  Marke t Research: MARCORSYSCOMs prior market research and field-testing has identified products that meet the MCW Clothing system requirements.  Using the performance characteristics of these products as minimum requirements, the Government plans to award a min imum number of multi-year contracts to buy the multiple items of the M/CW Clothing system to accomplish fielding initiatives.  The Government expects the contract vehicles to be a combination of a GSA Prime Vendor Blanket Purchase Agreement for commercial items, purchase orders for established mandatory source items, and IDIQ contract on any military unique item.

<CONTACT>Don Clifton Purchasing Agent 7037871061     donald.clifton@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center/GovWorks, on behalf of Naval Costal Warfare Group,  intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) under FAR 13.5 to acquire approx 2 Swiftlink DVM-90 units with 12months of services and accessories.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Telecommunication Systems, of Annapolis, MD 21401.   Telecommunication Systems is the only known vendor to provide the smallest VSAT package for deployment. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.   No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).     This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 517212 and PSC code 5810 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #AN66576.     However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.     All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:30p.m. EST October 13, 2006 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Telecommunication Systems Inc. for the requirements stated here. POC:  Don Clifton, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed to Don Clifton at Donald.Clifton@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

LOCAL STATEMENTS:

In accordance with FAR 52.211-6 the following is added for ?Brand Name or Equal? offers:
Technical literature must be submitted for ?EQUAL? products offered for the Government to perform a Technical evaluation.  No further request will be made to obtain required literature and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration. Award will be made relative to best overall value. Best value may include, but is not limited to: Past Performance, Technical Capability, Quality, Trade-In Considerations, Probable Life, Warranty, Maintainability and Price. Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers that exceed minimums may be rated more favorably. The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Not-withstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.

Offerors: Respond to entire request; it contains important information used to evaluate quotes. Failure to include all required documentation/information may render your offer nonresponsive.

The Naval Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure  3 each Navigation Radio Test Sets.  This is an open competition for obtaining this Test Set, and we are seeking small business providers.  The test set is designed for use in all weather at the organizational level of maintenance to test proper operation of the ARN-147 VOR/ILS/MB receiver.  Functional tests are performed on the VHF omnidirectional radio range-localizer, glideslope and marker beacon signals.  Either of the VOR tones of 30Hz can be deleted for a flag check, and a standard 1020 Hz modulation tone can be added.  Must allow for interface/rejection tests.  ILS signals for glideslope (GS) and Localizer (LOC) are provided for fixed center, full-scale deflection and continuously variable modes.  Marker Beacon is provided at a fixed RF level and provides the standard modulation signals of 400 HZ 1300 HZ and 3000 HZ.  The ability to test above aspects of the ARN-147 is the manditory minimum.  Equipment must be able to operate  in extreme temperatures, and the performance capabilities on a single battery charge, expected battery life will be considered in this competition.  These factors will be evaluated by Navy Engineers as a part of the selection process.  The Government reserves the right to determine best value based on the specifications provided by the vendor and the price offered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-045 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to procure FROM JTA Leasing Co LLC, 2050 Center Avenue, Suite 600, Fort Lee, NJ 07024 a Master Lease Agreement for: VEVO 770 High-Resolution in Vivo Imaging System (120V), RMV 707B ?High? Frame Rate? ScanHead, RMV 716 ScanHead, Pulsed Wave Doppler, M-Mode Capture and Analysis Software, Advanced Cardiovascular Package, Additional VEVO 770 Software Site Licenses, VEVO Integrated Rail System III, Mouse Handling Platform II, RAT Handling Platform II, VEVO Compact Anesthesia System (Mobile Version), ?E? Type Regulator, Image Starter Kit, Image-Guided Injection Starter Kit and Introductory 2-day On-Site user Training Session.  Anatomical, Functional (Flow), Physiological and molecular Data available from the Same Platform in Real-Time: The Vevo 770 allows the researcher to derive anatomical, function (or blood flow), physiological and molecular data (using contrast agents) from the same platform in real time and non-invasively for longitudinal studies of small animals and in vivo.  Size of Required Detection: The Vevo 770 non-invasive high-resolution imaging system is designed specifically for small animal imaging and can detect anatomical and physiological structures and hemodynamics with a spatial resolution down to 30 microns in real-time.  Frequency: The Vevo 770 provides imaging with frequencies up to 82.5 MHz as opposed to maximum frequencies of 15 MHZ provided by conventional clinical ultrasound machines.  Encapsulation of Scanhead: The Vevo 770 system is a high-resolution micro-imaging system using ultrasound that has an encapsulated probe (orscanhead) to reduce movement during the procedure of the subject being studied.  Rapid Screening Ability of Scanhead: VSI probes RMVTM Scanheads) are both hand held and mountable on an integrated Rail System allowing the researcher an excellent tool for rapid screening of mice and rats (ie, embryonic screening, mutant detection, verification and dating of pregnancy, confirmation of tumor growth, etc.).  Multiple Scanheads Available: Eight scanheads are available to provide the appropriate image results for specific small animal research applications.  These scanheads (RMVTM Scanheads) allow resolution down to 30 microns at varying depths of penetration and are designed specifically for small animal imaging.  Data Export: Data export is required for ongoing data analysis.  VSI allows easy data export and analysis of the imaging session data.  Measurements and calculations can be exported into MS ExcelTM spreadsheets and images can be exported as, TIFF or BMP (static images) or as Windows, AVI or Quicktime files (up to 300-frame cine loops). Experiment-based Data Management: Large numbers of data sets on multiple experiments on multiple animals require the imaging systems to facilitate an experiment-based approach to data analysis (as compared to a patient-based data orientation with clinical-imaging systems).  Typically, multiple researchers will perform measurements on the same animal and a single study will include multiple animals studies over multiple time-points.  The Vevo 770 software is designed in this manner and facilitates easy analysis and aggregation of multiple results. The Vevo Study Manager Is the Interface to this research-oriented software tool. In addition, unlike clinical systems which only allow a single set of measurements to be made on a particular image (for reasons of clinical diagnostics), the Vevo allows multiple researchers to make multiple instances of the same dClta and image and therefore measure and re-measure the same image.  High Frame Rate for Real-Time Visualization. The basis of small animal imaging requires a frame rate sufficiently high so as to provide images in real time. The VSI system has a frame rate of 100 Hz+ (in B-Mode) which allows for real-time visualization and data capture. Frame rates up to 240 Hz are achievable in sectored mode with specific cardiovascular RMV scanhead models while maintaining high line densities and image Quality. A frame rate of 1,000 frames/second is available in M-Mode and PW Doppler Mode. VSI also has a cardiac application called EKVTM (ECG-based Kilohertz Reconstruction) that provides line-based reconstructed visualization and measurement of the beating adult mouse heart at up to 1,000 frames/second.  Needle-guided injection/extraction system. Due to very small size of the sma11 animal subjects and the requirement to visualize and guide injection, procedures, researchers require the ability to ensure the accurate and successful injection and extraction of "products" (cells, genetic materials) into the target areas of their animals in vivo. The VSI image-guided needle injection/extraction system was designed specifically for this application and is integrated into the core Vevo 770 imaging system. The injection apparatus includes the option of a micro-injection unit as well as the ability to incorporate conventional syringes (ie. for adult mouse cardiac injection procedures).  Dedicated Mouse/Rat-Handling and Physiological Monitoring Apparatus:  In order to streamline the workflow involved with imaging a small animal and ensure optimal image results, it is critical that the imaging system is quickly brought into alignment of the area of focus and that the anesthetized mouse/rat is quickly and easily manipulated for optimal imaging. The VSI rail-mounted small animal handling and monitoring apparatus is a bench-mounted adjustable rail system that is custom designed for small animal handling, positioning and physiological monitoring. The system includes a resistor-based heating system to ensure that the comfort of the mouse while anesthetized is maximized and that the environment during the imaging session closely reflects normal physiological activity. The table also has ECG pads that allow ECG to be captured and displayed on-screen in all three imaging modes.   Integrated Blood Pressure with High-Resolution Micro-Imaging: The Vevo 770 allows integrated blood pressure analysis functionality (ie. the integration of a blood pressure signal from a third-party continuous pressure monitoring system). Examples include integration with conductance catheter and telemetry blood pressure monitoring. The integrated blood pressure can be combined with the Vevo ultrasound Image data and corresponding measurements to perform small animal pressure-volume and vascular strain analysis.  Real time imaging: Real time imaging allows for greater accuracy of needle-?guided injection/extraction, more precise focus of study, efficient use of lab time, and rapid completion of study given the limited time frame allowed for a small animal being studied to be under anesthesia.  It is also critical for cardiac and flow studies or evaluation of dynamic targets. The VSI Vevo 770 provides such real time visualization and phenotyping functionality. Relative visualization and quantification of blood flow in tumors:  The Vevo 770 high-resolution Imaging system can visualize and quantify tumors in soft tissue in subcutaneous targets as well as orthotopically. With Power Doppler, slow-flowing vasculature in target tumors can be detected and a relative flow measure is applied. With 3D Power Doppler, CI 30 volumetric measurement of the tumor plus a 3D image of the now and flow architecture is provided along with a "PV? or Percent Vascularity Index for quantification of tumor flow within the defined tumor area. As such, tumor growth and flow can be visualized and monitored longitudinally.  No special room with shielding required: With the VisualSonics ultrasound-?based product, there are no radioactive substances used, and unlike other imaging modalities, no dedicated room or special room shielding is required.  Portability of system: The VSI system is portable and can be moved by operators with relative ease from one room or lab to another or within the animal colony to increase the utilization of the system and to serve the possible needs of multiple labs.  Flexibility of applications and techniques: The Vevo 770 has eight different scanheads available at different frequencies to enable imaging of various species and to varying degrees of detail. Its applications include cardiovascular research, neurobiological research, cancer biology, developmental biology, nephrology, etc. The Vevo also has the ability to perform a number of required techniques including screening, needle-guided injections/extractions, tumor identification, characterization and measurement and blood flow analysis. Its basic system also can be upgraded with additional functionality when required which distinguishes it from other systems.  Reduced training and expertise.  The Vevo 770 high-resolution imaging system can be operated after only modest instruction with relatively brief setup time. Advanced imaging or sonography experience is not a prerequisite for operating the system. In addition, VSI has a comprehensive series of 2-day on-site training programs that can easily be customized to individual research program needs. Extensive Custom And organized Group Training Sessions: VisualSonics offers custom on-site training (application- and customer-specific programming) -as well as pre-set group courses frequently throughout the calendar year involving in vivo training in the licensed Toronto imaging facility. Additional courses are also held In North American in association with The Jackson Laboratory and in Europe with Animage (France).  Imaging data storage and retrieval: During imaging, many large data files are created. Therefore a system is needed that is capable of storing and retrieving large amounts of data. The VSI Vevo 770 is equipped with a 120 GB hard drive and an on-board DVD drive sufficient to meet expanding data needs.  Network connectivity: Having the capability to move these large data files from the instrument to an institutional network or to collaborating colleagues is critical in the research environment. The VSI product possesses the network connectivity required. Compact system footprint: The VSI Vevo 770's footprint is 28? (width) x 38? (depth) X 59? (height, with monitor and can easily be moved to less congested areas or to other labs requiring use of the system through the use of its large rolling casters. Imaging data stored in multiple formats:  Images should be able to be viewed as static (or still) or in a moving or animated state.  The Vevo 770 allows for image capture, review and export as static images or as 300-frame, 10-second CineLoop files. PW Doppler files are also available as wav audio files to detect irregularities for flow analysis.  Small animal-based measurements and annotations: Once captured, images require extensive and rapid measurement and annotation.  The Vevo 770 provides extensive measurements and annotations functionality with over 200 small animal-based predetermined measurements and calculations embedded within the software. All measurements and calculations are exported to MS ExcelTM or a standard spreadsheet to facilitate post-imaging analysis. In addition, all image files can be opened by a second investigator and re-measured and annotated for purposes of validation and verification.  Quantification scales are appropriate for small animal research: All measurements and calculations utilize sizes that are appropriate for the anatomical and functional targets on small animals. For example, linear measurements are in grams and mm (as opposed to cm for clinical systems) and milliseconds (as opposed to seconds for clinical systems). Integrated Isoflurane-based anesthesia: The Vevo 770 has an integrated small animal anesthesia system available with the imaging system. Anesthesia hoses are connected to the small animal handling platforms and specific nose pieces are available for mice and rats. Once under anesthesia, mouse body temperature can be monitored through the physiological controller and modified through heated resistors in the mouse platform.

STATEMENT OF WORK DARPA 50th Anniversary Display October 20th, 2007 1.0 SUMMARY The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) seeks to obtain a contractor to develop and produce a display that showcases DARPA?s 50th Anniversary. This exhibit will be displayed at the DARPATech Conference at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, CA August 6- 9, 2007. DARPATech is conducted approximately every 18 months to inform the private industry, the academic community, and the military services of the DARPA mission. The last DARPATech was held in August 2005 and is described at http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2005/index.htm. The display will occupy approximately 10ft(width) x 60ft (length) x 15ft(height) of exhibit hall space (See attached floor plan). There may also be separate pedestals or stand alone items that will need to be developed and set up for additional content/displays throughout the lobby and exhibit halls of the Marriott. The objective is to create a standalone display that will provide a centerpiece to the DARPATech 07 exhibits and communicate DARPA's technical achievements since 1958. As an option, the contractor may be asked to recreate the display at the 50th Anniversary Conference and Dinner at the Washington DC Hilton on 10 April 2008. For the performance of the requirements specified in this Statement of Work, DARPA will identify as a minimum a 50th Anniversary Display Coordinator and planning staff. These personnel will perform the following duties: Provide a comprehensive list of content elements and assist the contractor in understanding the nature and context of specific content in DARPA's history. Obtain public release approval for all content. (Department of Defense regulations require material scheduled for public release undergo a security review. DARPA has processes in place to conduct such a review). Provide government recommendations/approvals to the contractor promptly in all cases where the contract calls for technical approval. 2.0 TASKS 2.1 Design / Planning: The Contractor will begin design efforts with an initial meeting between DARPA 50th Anniversary planning personnel and the contractor to be held on 15 December 2006 at DARPA in Arlington, VA.

The list of content along with descriptions to be included in the display will be provided to the Contractor at the initial planning meeting. The Contractor will submit 3 versions of second draft designs due NLT 15 January 2007. Final presentation of the design will be presented for review NLT 31 January 2007. 2.1.2 The Contractor will prepare and maintain a master schedule of activities to meet all planned display development and construction objectives. The Contractor will provide updates to the master schedule for DARPA review upon request. 2.2 Fabrication: (Note: Focus of this phase is placed on the contractor's build out of the display and integration of content.) (Deliverable due dates: On going between 01 February and 29 June 2007) 2.2.1 Upon final design approval by the DARPA, the Contractor will begin construction at their facility. The contractor will not make any changes to the approved design or depart from the design in any way during construction without prior approval but DARPA reserves the right to make design changes during the fabrication process. Contract mods will be made only through the DARPA Contracting Officer. 2.2.2 The Contractor will hold monthly status meetings with the 50th Anniversary planning personnel via telecon or VTC to provide updates on the fabrication effort. The Contractor will provide updated visual renderings of proposed changes and/or integration of content along with a list of any potential problems, cost issues or construction delays at each of these meetings. 2.2.3 The Contractor's fabrication efforts will culminate in a set up and walkthrough of the display at the Contractor's facility or other approved site NLT 29 June 2007. This walkthrough will include all available content items. Content items that are not immediately available will be represented by a photo or scaled representation to be produced by the Contractor (DARPA will provide photos of this content).

Any material considered proprietary shall be marked as such with any associated disposition/handing instructions. Submissions to this RFQ will not be returned.

Offers shall be signed and dated and show the date/time specified in the RFQ for receipt of offers; the name, address, telephone number and email address of the administrative point of contact for the offeror; acknowledgement of solicitation amendments, if applicable; and the period for acceptance of the offer (minimum of 30 days required). Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of offer received at the designated Government office after the exact time "Offer Due Date" designated in the solicitation is "late" and will be handled by the Government as indicated by FAR 52.212-1. 7. Communications. The Government intends to evaluate all offers received and award without discussions. However, in order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and / or hold discussions, with one or more of the offerors. (E) SUBCONTRACTING & TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS - Subcontracting and Contractor Team arrangements are permissible in response to the RFQ. The following guidance applies regardless of any arrangements made between the prime and subcontractors: ? All proposal submissions must come under the Prime Contractor ? The Prime Contractor will, at all times, be solely responsible for performance and adherence to the standards in the task order ? The Prime Contractor is responsible for compliance with DARPA?s operating procedures, including ODC qualifications, travel approval and submission of backup ? materials, and adherence to quality standards; and ? Only the Prime Contractor will have any privity of contractual arrangement (e.g., access to DARPA staff). Proposed arrangements with subcontractors must be clearly identified in proposals to the Government. Identification must include the scope of the work to be performed as well as the method of inclusion (i.e. labor category and rates or other direct cost (ODC)). If a task order is awarded to a contractor who proposed a non-schedule subcontractor as an ODC, that subcontracting arrangement is not subject to the GSA Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). Typically, ODC labor is capped at five percent (5%) of total task order labor value unless other, specific conditions are met and called out in the RFQ language. While there are many variations of team arrangements, DARPA adheres to the traditional "prime contractor-subcontractor" interpretation. At all times, the Prime Contractor is responsible for performance and management, regardless of team size, makeup, or flow-down subcontracting agreements. (F) RFQ EVALUATION CRITERIA - The government will make a single award resulting from this RFQ to the responsible Offeror whose conforming business and technical offer is considered most advantageous to the government. In order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and/or hold discussions, at its discretion, with one or more of the offerors. The Government will evaluate offers based on the following criteria listed below: 1. The overall approach in supporting the development and production of an exhibit showcasing DARPA's 50th Anniversary. 2. Past performance that shows experience in developing and producing conference displays and exhibits (evidenced by samples of prior work) and an ability to manage time and cost sensitive tasks. 3. The quality and availability of the Contractor's Key Personnel as evidenced by prior corporate experience related to the proposed tasks. 4. Cost realism and Reasonableness. Relative order of importance for the evaluation factors is as follows: a and b-Equal and more important than c c -More important than d As a competitive "best value" solicitation, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest bidder, at its discretion. (G) AWARD ? Contractors will be notified by email regarding the disposition of their proposals. These notifications will be issued at the time the CO issues the contract to the selected Contractor.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to modify the Brand Name requirement of this Synopsis to include brand name or equivalent items in accordance to the FAR Part 11.104. Quotes for Brand Name equivalent items will be accepted. <b>For any equivalent items quoted, vendors shall provide the salient characteristics of each line item in their quote and the proposed brand name equivalent system must provide the output receptacles listed below and must include a network card for monitoring via SNMP.</b></p>
<p>Output Receptacles: (4) L6-20R, (4) L6-30R and (12) 5-20R</p>

<p>Note 1 - Some SSA locations will use the four L6-20R output receptacles and other locations will use the four L6-30R output receptacles. Not all eight receptacles will be used simultaneously, but it is required that each UPS system provide all eight receptacles so that the agency has the flexibility to upgrade network equipment or power supplies to high capacity without modifying the UPS system. In the APC solution, the four L6-30R receptacles are built into the UPS chassis and the four L6-20R receptacles are provided via a rack-mount power distribution unit.</p>
<p>Note 2 - To provide circuit diversity, the twelve 5-20R output receptacles must be split across two output circuit breakers. Router-1, Radio-1, and Encrypter-1 will be plugged into the first circuit, while Router-2, Radio-2 and Encrypter-2 will be plugged into the second circuit. In the APC solution, the twelve 5-20R receptacles are provided via a rack-mount power distribution unit.</p>
<p>Due to this change, the response date has been extended to November 6, 2006.</p>
