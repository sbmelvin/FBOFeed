<DESC>The objective of this effort is to develop a control architecture that enables UAS to operate in the terminal area with specific emphasis on ground operations. The UAS operator should be assumed on-the-loop, where his input is not required, but he can intervene at any time. Five challenge areas (all or some) should be taken into consideration during the development.<br />Communication-based response. In the terminal area, the communication-response-action timeline is time- and latency-critical. UAS should be able to receive, acknowledge and perform all commands from ATC in a timely manner. In case of unclear instructions or if the UAS believes ATC has given an incorrect command, the UAS should be able to obtain clarification. Autonomous response to ATC is a potential solution.<br />Navigation and collision avoidance. After receiving commands from ATC, UAS should be able to complete the assigned task autonomously and in a human-like fashion. This requires safe and accurate navigation of the air field but should not require extensive airfield surveys or changes to the airfield infrastructure.<br />Intent of other aircraft. UAS should be able to use data from onboard sensors combined with a greater understanding of typical airfield operations to determine the intent of other aircraft. For example, by logging ATC communications, the UAS can gain a better understanidng of the state of other aircraft on the airfield. This intent understanding allows the UAS to be more proactive than reactive in its behavior.<br />Integrity management. Due to the complexity and criticality of the terminal area environment, the integrity of systems and data should be evalutated throughout UAS operational periods.<br />Sensors. While no sensors should be developed for this effort, appropriate sensor suites should be investigated. Additionally, sensors already in existence on typical UAS as well as those being considered for other functions such as Sense and Avoid should be taken into consideration as part of a potential TAO sensor suite. <br />Technical Point of Contact: Bonnie Schwartz, AFRL/RBCC, (937) 255-3546, bonnie.schwartz@wpafb.af.mil<br />

<a href="mailto:patricia.k.wells@us.army.mil">AMCOM CONTR CTR, Aviation Integration Directorate (CCAM-RDI)</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Integration Directorate (AID) of the US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) proposes to procure for the Special Operations Mission Planning Office (SOMPO), technical and programmatic requirements for the next generation 3D Mapping Engine, an Integrated Software Suite of Mission Planning and Execution Tools for time critical command and control of globally distributed Special Operations Forces (SOF). The SOF requires software tools that support rapid and accurate mission planning across ground, aviation, and maritime operational domains. Current 3D mapping software applications require significant lead time (24 hours to weeks), and technical expertise to stand-up or update a particular 3D database. Current database can require a myriad of data sources (e.g. NGA, Google Earth, Microsoft Mapping products, etc.) in order to provide an accurate spatial representation of an area of interest. The 3D databases are unique in the data can be ingested for updates or adding disconnected data for individual assets that may be time sensitive. As SOF continues to prosecute more Time Sensitive Targets, available time and resources, such as bandwidth, for creating an accurate 3D visual picture diminish. Therefore, inputting data at the SOF end-user level must be enabled in a simple one-touch fashion. The Contractor shall provide software, software licenses and software services to establish, develop, and support the Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE) 3-Dimension (3D) Mapping Engine. Market research has indicated that one manufacturer can meet this requirement. As the previous developer this will be a sole source procurement to Geoweb3D Inc., 3829 Brady Hill Road, Binghamton, NY 13903-6324, Cage Code 5C4T9. The authority to use other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. One single commercial Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, plus ordering period of four years is anticipated. As specified by separate task order(s), the Contractor shall provide software development services to enhance the overall functionality and usability. This procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 12 and 15 procedures. Not sooner than 15 days following this publication in FedBizOps, the Request for Proposal (RFP) W91215-10-R-0011 will be issued. The anticipated date of availability of the solicitation is July 13, 2010. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this procurement is 541512. Awardee will be required to receive and or generate classified information in performing many of the task orders under this contract. Accordingly, the offeror will be required to provide evidence that they possess at least a current SECRET facility clearance and storage capability (including computer facilities) or have the ability to obtain one by time of award.

This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.	The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>This procurement action is being funded with supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.

<DESC><strong>GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION: </strong>
<p>The purpose and intent of this contract is to secure services for creating 100 canopy gaps of 1/10 acre each in conifer reproduction, approximately 40 years old. The Contractor must furnish all labor, equipment, housing, subsistence, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals except those items listed as Government-furnished property.<br />The performance period is 75 calendar days.</p>
<p>PROJECT LOCATION:</p>
<p>The items are on west Prince of Wales Island, in the Staney Creek area, along Forest Roads 2054100 and 2054120. Prince of Wales Island is part of the Thorne Bay and Craig Ranger Districts, Tongass National Forest, Alaska. The project is approximately 23 air miles northwest of Thorne Bay.</p>
<p>Ketchikan is accessible via Alaska Airlines and the Alaska Marine Highway System. Commercial floatplane services, based in Ketchikan, fly passengers and freight to communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island. The Inter-Island Ferry system provides vehicle and passenger service between the Hollis ferry terminal, on Prince of Wales Island and Ketchikan. A paved/gravel road system connects Hollis to most communities and logging camps located on Prince of Wales Island. During the winter months, only the roads connecting the communities of Hollis, Craig/Klawock, and Thorne Bay are maintained and passable. Barge lines in Seattle, Washington transport materials and equipment to Thorne Bay, Craig and Ketchikan.</p>
<p>Because of the uniqueness of Southeast Alaska regarding access, logistics, and service points, it is strongly recommended that prospective Contractors adequately familiarize themselves with the area to help determine mobilization costs, living, and travel expenses.</p>

<DESC>The Olympic National Forest, Washington, intends to acquire by contract design and construction of a stream crossing structure and road realignment on FSR 2900 at M.P. 19.3. The Forest Service has three alternative approaches to the design of the stream crossing structure and road realignment. One alternative is a bridge. Offerors may submit proposals for any or all of the alternative approaches. A flood event removed the roadway and culvert at the project site. Contractor shall partially excavate the debris on the site before SEPT. 30, 2010, to facilitate completion of the design before the start of the 2011 construction season. Final design calculations and design modifications drawings shall be stamped by a licensed professional engineer
<p>The culvert replacement at M.P. 17.6 requires removal of a 24 inch diameter culvert and replacement with a 48 inch diameter culvert.</p>
<p>The government will provide preliminary design drawings with the solicitation. <br />This project is located on the Olympic National Forest, Pacific Ranger District, Section 1, T 28 N, R 11 W, and Section 31, T 29 N, R 10 W., near Forks, Washington. FSR 2900 is one mile north of Forks, Washington, on HWY. 101. Turn right onto FSR 2900.</p>
<p>Period for performance is from contract award to October 31, 2011.</p>
<p>Project Manager is Mr. Shannon Henriquez, 360-956-2264.</p>
<p>The Forest Service will proceed to issue a solicitation as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about July 06, 2010. This acquisition is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. This Forest Service will use a two-phase design-build source selection procedure. For Phase I, Offerors will be evaluated on their qualifications to perform this requirement. The three (3) highest rated Offerors will be selected for Phase II and requested to submit a price proposal and a technical proposal. The Forest Service will award a firm fixed-price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and has been determined to be the best value to the Forest Service, quality (comprised of technical approach and performance capability factors), and price considered. The government estimated value is between $500,000 and $750,000.</p>
<p>A bid bond is required with Offeror's Phase II proposal. Performance and payment bonds are required for this project. Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to any resulting contract. The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Oxford Instrument X-Ray Technology, Inc., Instrument

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-169-DDC. 
A tabletop micro-focus x-ray source, with the following specifications;
  
Tube voltage	focal spot size (um)	tube current (mA)
30 to 80 kV	13 - 21	0.111 – 2.0
  
The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of  Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics   has a mission for the Imaging Physics Section to develop non-invasive imaging technologies for the benefit of biomedical applications. A current focus of the laboratory’s program is phase-contrast x-ray imaging. This is a new class of x-ray imaging techniques that holds the promise of substantially enriching the information content in radiography and CT. After our first experience with small animal imaging, we are building a new imaging system with a 5 – 10 fold increase in the phase-contrast, and the requirement for the source of the system is that it has a small enough focal spot size to attain the necessary spatial coherence, and it has sufficient tube current at 50 kVp to keep the exposure time to within a minute. As part of the research project to develop phase-contrast x-ray imaging technology for biomedical applications, the Government needs a micro-focus x-ray source with the following specifications: maximum tube current at 50 kVp >= 1.0 mA, focal spot size at this operating condition < = 20 microns. Oxford XTG met both requirements. Therefore, it is in the Government best interest to procure this system to complete the project.

 The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Building 10 Room B1D416 Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334411, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard of 750 employees; this is not a small business set-aside.

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition 
procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-41 (May 13, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by June 25, 2010, 7:30am Eastern Standard Time.

<a href="mailto:MILLER.DEBBIE@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) is conducting market research for information purposes only.  The intent is to identify all potential sources, especially including small business sources with the capacity and technicalcapability necessary to successfully perform the requirement stated herein, and detailed in the draft Statement of Work referenced below.  
The requirement is for "Technical and Outreach Support Services for Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Development and Implementation", which will support the mission of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) within the Climate Change Division (CCD) of the Environmental Protection Agency.  This requirement is partly a continuation of current work under the Climate Change Divisions Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts: EP-W-07-067, EP-W-07-068, EP-W-07-069, EP-W-07-070, EP-W-07-071 and EP-W-07-072; but it is also a new requirement for development and expansion into a new programmatic area.  Congress directed EPA in the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act to develop and implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule for all sectors of the economy.  40 CFR Part 98 was published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2009.  In general, it requires annual reporting of the GHG emissions from certain fossil fuel or industrial gas suppliers or facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year. The rule establishes appropriate thresholds, and methods to be used to calculate emissions for specific subparts.  The rule also includes provisions to ensure the accuracy of emissions data through monitoring, recordkeeping and verification requirements.  Potential offerors will support the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program's mission by providing technical and engineering analyses support, regulatory program and guidance development support, outreach and communications support, data system and information technology support, and finally data analytics and publication support.  

EPA anticipates awarding multiple IDIQ contracts to support this requirement with an estimated total value between $100 Million and $200 Million. Each contract is anticipated to have one (1) 12-month base period, and four (4) 12-month option periods. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this procurement is 541620 -Environmental Consulting Services.   The results of this Request for Information/Sources Sought notice will help EPA determine how it will satisfy this requirement.
All potential offerors are requested to identify and provide a brief description of potential conflicts of interest areas that their firm may have in relation to the source categories listed in Table A., Table B., and Table C. in the Appendix of the draft Statement of Work.  
This is a Request for Information /sources sought notice for written information only.  This notice is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  EPA will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor reimburse the cost incurred by potential offerors who respond to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and FAR 6.302-1, the Department of Army intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the DoD Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office (CNTPO) for a Field Information Support Tool (FIST). The backbone of the FIST contains proprietary software that was developed by Kestrel Technology Group, LLC.  The FIST is a focused effort to develop, demonstrate, and validate a knowledge management system.

A phased approach to development will lead to a fully developed system design.  The combination of these phases allows for development of the client software for the FIST front-end hand-held device, integration of the back-end databases and analysis tool suite to be accessed through a network connection, and integration of sensors to enhance situational awareness.  During each phase, FIST will be tested in operationally relevant environments to demonstrate and validate the capability to collect and process socio-cultural data for use in developing Ethnographic Intelligence (EI).  For phases where FIST will be tested Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), tests will be conducted by, with, and through host nation support.<BR>Responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide a SOFTWARE SYSTEM AND DATA FOR ACUTE AND LONGER-TERM INTAKE ASSESSMENTS.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) primary mission is to promote and protect public health. FDA's pre-market approval processes for food and color additives require an estimate of the probable consumer intake of the additive to determine whether its use or presence in a food at a given concentration is safe. Additionally, FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) estimates consumer intakes not only of food and color additives but also of ingredients generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and other substances (e.g., chemical contaminants, including naturally-occurring toxicants) found in the diet.<br /><br />Currently, to perform its exposure estimates, FDA CFSAN only relies on consumption data collected by surveys conducted by the USDA under contract with Health and Human Services' CDC. The CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), dating from 1999 through 2006, were conducted using 24-hour dietary recall methodology for one or two days. Therefore, CDC NHANES does not accurately represent longer-term intake of food, both in terms of the number of eating occasions of a given food and the amount of that food that is consumed.<br /><br />OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this upcoming requirement is to procure an expert scientific and modelling software system designed to provide FDA CFSAN scientists with the ability to calculate food consumption and intake of food ingredients for the United States (US) population.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Single or Multiple, Interlinked Food and Cosmetic Product and Packaging Databases for CAERS and Other Research.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a continuing need for current, cost effective, and accurate data on the exposure of consumers to processed food products and food ingredients that are either manufactured for sale or imported for sale into the United States (US) marketplace and presumed consumed by the US population. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) defines processed food as "any food other than a raw agricultural commodity and includes any raw agricultural commodity that has been subject to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration, or milling" [FD&amp;C Act, sec. 201(gg)]. Typically altered from their natural state for safety and/or convenience, processed foods are aseptically processed and packaged. Dietary supplements and infant formula are included in the definition of processed foods.
<p>Additionally, FDA has a continuing need for current, cost effective, and accurate data on the exposure of consumers to color additives and other substances in cosmetic products sold in US retail stores, online as mail order or door-to-door and presumed consumed by the US population. FD&amp;C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as "articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance" [FD&amp;C Act, sec. 201(i)]. Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes, and deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.</p>
<p>FDA needs to continue to gather such data to have a complete and comprehensive knowledge of these manufactured products, their ingredients, labeling and packaging in order to better assess how they may affect human exposure as part of the agency's ongoing mission to protect public health. FDA, through the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), has devoted considerable resources to continuously monitor the safety of food ingredients, dietary supplements, infant formula, and cosmetics. FDA has determined that the most cost-effective means to advance the agency's objectives is (1) to obtain accurate, quality-assured, easily-validated (a) food ingredient, (b) food product, (c) cosmetic ingredient, and (d) cosmetic product information that is nationally representative of the US marketplace, which has been well-organized within one or more relationally searchable database(s) for trend and other analyses; and (2) to obtain coding images for all the labels for validation and other research purposes.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this order is to procure a subscription(s) and a site license(s), which are unlimited in access but restricted to approximately 200 CFSAN personnel to one or more relationally-searchable databases that contain information on food and cosmetic products currently available in the United States (U.S.). The contents of the databases should include, but are not limited to, product label images (from all sides), Nutrition Facts label, ingredient list, warning statements/icons, statements/icons/signages and similar information that features the nutrition, health, organoleptic, processing, and other properties of the product. In addition, the databases should include and allow access to information that is summarized and derived from individual products. For the respective product ingredients, the database(s) should contain synonym names; flag products containing known allergens, and identify the technical or functional effect of the product ingredient.<br /><br />Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively specifically address these requirements will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall be limited to 7 pages, and must include:<br />1.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT<br /></strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. <br /><br />This is a Sources Sought notice with the intent to award a sole source contract to Keyence Corporation of America (Keyence) under the authority of FAR 6.302 because Keyence is the original manufacturer and supplier of the digital microscope described in this notice and is uniquely qualified to provide a Keyence VHX-1000E digital microscope and stage controller to interface with the existing Keyence lenses and staging that will directly attach and integrate to its proprietary Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope as described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to perform the anticipated work.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.<br /><br />The NTSB has a requirement to accurately and effectively document factual evidence on transportation accident components and systems. The NTSB partially accomplishes this requirement through digital photography using a Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope. The NTSB first purchased the Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope from Keyence in 2007. The NTSB has used the digital microscope as a system for accurate and effective photo documentation of accident components. <br /><br />To aid in the photographic documentation of accident components, the NTSB requires a Keyence VHX-1000E digital microscope and stage controller system to interface with the existing Keyence lenses and staging. This new requirement will increase and augment the capabilities of the existing Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope by creating a second capture station. In addition, the new system will utilize existing Keyence lens and accessories thereby increasing efficiencies and reducing costs to the Government.<br /><br />Specifically, NTSB has a requirement for a Keyence VHX-1000E digital microscope and stage controller system consisting of the following items:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Part # VHX-1000E. Digital microscope with accessories. Quantity 1. <br />2. Part # VHX-1100 camera unit Quantity 1.<br />3. Part # VHX-H3M. H3M application software. Quantity 1.<br />4. Part # VHX-S15CE. Motorized stage controller. Quantity 1.<br />5. Part # OP-84263 Double'R Cable /Software for VHX-500FE. Quantity 1. <br />6. Part # OP-32681. VH Borescope Attachment. Quantity 1.<br />7. Part # OP-51647. Bayonet adapter D. Quantity 1.<br />8. Part # OP-33242. Bore fiber cable for VH. Quantity 1. <br />9. Part # OP-51482. Fiber conversion adapter. Quantity 1. <br />10. Part # OP-99021. Standard AC cable. Quantity 1.<br /><br />The Keyence digital microscope and stage controller is a proprietary system and requires the appropriate and compatible equipment to function. Keyence is the only known company that supplies compatible equipment to its proprietary microscope. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Capabilities</span></strong><br />Sources capable of satisfying this requirement as described above must provide equipment that is compatible with the existing Keyence VHX-600 microscope. The equipment must increase and augment the capabilities of the existing Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope by creating a second capture station. In addition, the equipment must meet or exceed the functional characteristics of all part numbers for the Keyence VHX-1000E digital microscope and stage controller system above.<br /><br />Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a ten (10)-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by NTSB. Parties must submit information within five days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office to Bryan Moy via email at: bryan.moy@ntsb.gov.</p>

Patient Wandering System Replacement
June 2010

The Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS) is considering a new patient wandering system for its facilities.  The purpose of this Statement of Need is to determine if industry is capable of providing the system as SAVAHCS would like to use, as well as determine if there are additional features.  Feedback on the Statement of Need, as well as comments from interested parties is encouraged.   

Current Operations: 

The Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS) has several areas where patients are cared for with impaired cognition. Patient wandering systems are designed to prevent the elopement of patients who have impaired cognitive abilities. The existing patient wandering system is no longer reliable to prevent this type of patient from eloping from the area where they are receiving care. The current system utilizes a keypad to reset alarms and provide a timed, alarm bypass for transportation of patients. The keypad requires a numerical code, to enable certain functions of the system. The current system has only three codes available; A user, maintenance and service code. The one user code is shared among all staff and volunteers to acknowledge alarms and bypass the system for patient transport. The maintenance and service codes used for programming and testing are shared among all technicians. 

Description of Need:

The new patient wander system will be a more robust system. Information about a patient, including their picture, name, room number, tag id, etc, can be entered into the system. This information can then be used to assist with locating the patient should they wander away from their area of care. The information can also be used to modify a patient's care by trending the number of times they activated the alarm, the time of day they activate the alarm, or if there is certain day that has greater activity, etc. A proximity card is envisioned allowing readers to reset the alarms and enable the transport of patients to other areas of the medical center. The new system must be upgradeable. Spare parts and adequate manuals and / or schematics must be available to maintain the system by SAVAHCS Biomedical Engineering Electronic Technicians. The system must be able to be expanded. The ICU and SDU are possible areas of future expansion.
 
Nurse Station 

At the Nurse's station, there will be an intelligent client or workstation that is easy for staff to use when enrolling a patient, acknowledging alarms or performing any routine function. These daily tasks must be easy to perform and have auditable records back to the person that performed each task. The client or workstation should be wall mounted or occupy minimal desk space at each nurse's station. Patient tags will be stored at the nurse's station in a locked metal box. The condition of the battery inside the tag should be tested by the system as automatically as possible reducing workload on nursing staff and eliminating human error. 

Doors or potential elopement areas 

All exits within the seven defined areas will be protected for possible patient elopement and will have proximity card readers / keypads at the exit to acknowledge alarms or bypass the system for escorted patient transportation. Both methods of acknowledgement must be auditable back to the person by I.D. card or P.I.N. All exits will also have localized alarm enunciators. The protected area needs to be sensitive enough to detect a patient wearing a transmitter (tag), even if the patient is attempting to conceal the tag behind wheelchair panels or other obstructions. The system also needs to be concentrated or focused enough to not falsely pick up tags in adjoining rooms close to protected areas. The area doors could be unlocked during normal working hours, but could be timed to lock during the off tours. If the system incorporates a pre-warn system; Activation of the pre-alert alarm will need to be a nursing decision. The pre-alert function can be activated or deactivated thru the main server. The person who responds to an exit door alarm will be required to use their ID card to reset the system, once the patient has been removed from the detection zone. 

Patient transmit tags 

Patient tags need to be secured to the patient where normal human strength cannot remove the tag. Special tools or extra strength cutters located at the nurses' station should be the only way the tags can be removed. The tags should be waterproof for wear in shower or bath. If cut-band or tag tamper alerting Patient Wander System Replacement is available or rechargeable or replaceable batteries are available, we would like to consider it as an option 

Overall system 

Each nursing area will have a client work station. The client work station will allow nursing personnel to perform certain user functions according to their level of access. A client work station will also be located in the Police Operations. The status of the system for any particular area must be viewable at that areas nurse's station and Police Operations. Also any alarm for a particular area must alarm at the point of elopement, the nurse's station for that area and at Police Operations. The system will be networked together to allow system wide monitoring by Police Operations and system wide programming or monitoring by Biomedical Engineering Electronics. This system will also be interfaced into the automated Physical Security Information Management System (PSIMS). Interfacing to PSIMS allows all facility cameras in the area of a possible elopement to automatically appear on the video wall in police operations and automatically position movable cameras (PTZ) to the area of the elopement alarm. The PSIMS will also instruct the Police Operator on the proper procedure for each particular alarm. The PSIMS vendor or Biomedical Engineering will interface and program the PSIMS. The Vendor providing this new Patient Wander System will provide to SAVAHCS all requested information regarding addressing, TCP ports, data definitions, etc. necessary to interface with PSIMS. An API / SDK will be provided. If real-time patient tracking is available, that will be submitted as an option. 
The system must also report or alarm to Police Operations any fault on the system. The system must be fully supervised. If any protected area fails or is disarmed for any reason, the client / workstation in Police Operations must alarm. 
The person who responds to an exit door alarm will be required to use their ID card or PIN to reset the system, once the patient has been removed from the detection zone. The proximity card readers will be able to read the current identification cards worn by employees. This will enable the system to be programmed to allow only certain employees to transport patients or reset alarms. When a door alarm is activated it will require an authorized employee to go to the door and reset the alarm with their ID card or PIN. During the off tours an employee could exit from a locked door by using their ID card to unlock the door without activating the alarm. 

Area Definitions 

SAVAHCS currently has seven areas, protected individually by patient wandering systems. These will be detailed further in any solicitation issued.  

Programming of the System 

The Contractor will be required to program the users, supervisors and administrators into the system. Nursing Service will be required to provide a list of nursing staff, which will be entered as users and supervisors of the system. The Biomedical Engineering Electronic technicians will be entered as administrators of the system. All of the Police staff will be programmed into the system as users. Police Patient Wander System Replacement users will not be able to cancel alarms from the client located in Police Operations. The Contractor will program all of the tags that are purchased.

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).</p>
<p>( ) TIN: --------------------.</p>
<p>( ) TIN has been applied for.</p>
<p>( ) TIN is not required because:</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division in support of the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, is soliciting concept papers from interested firms for integrated short-range, low bandwidth, wearable communications, sensing and networking technologies that will enable the analysis, display, and remote monitoring of physiologic, and geo-location data from free-roaming dismounted Warfighters in austere military training settings.  The Government intends on awarding one contract under topic C.7 Body-Worn Systems, Hand Held Devices, and Smart-Lightweight Electronic components/Modules for Soldier Protection, Knowledge Management and Cognitive Improvement of the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 09-11.  These technologies will be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of training, decrease the likelihood of environmentally-induced injuries, and speed evacuation in the event of illness or injury.  The envisioned three-tiered network topology includes an on-body bi-directional inductive Personal Area Network (I-PAN) integrated with a Squad Area Network (SAN) that links individual trainees with their instructor/squad leader.  The third tier is formed by a repeater backbone capable of relaying data from a SAN to a central Tactical Operations Center (TOC).  The overall design must adhere to a minimalist philosophy of simplicity of operation, robustness, technological transparency to the Government, openness to new third-party sensors and algorithms, and ease of maintenance. The desired technologies generally fall into the category of mobile, ad-hoc, delay/disruption-tolerant mesh networks.  A fully operational prototype network comprising a minimum of 5 Trainee Nodes, 1 Instructor Node, 1 Repeater Node, and 1 Tactical Operations Center Node that includes user interface and network setup and data management software, is desired at the end of Phase One.  The work effort for Phase two and Phase three (comprising contract option years) will focus on scaling the system to Platoon and Company level applications, respectively.   Each node must be capable of hosting Government-furnished health state classification algorithms and of storing both physiologic and network performance data for later analysis.  The system and its underlying technologies must ultimately be scalable for simultaneous use by Battalion-sized groups.  The BAA is available at https://www3.natick.army.mil under Broad Agency Announcement.   The BAA contains instructions for submission of concept papers.  Interested parties are invited to submit a concept paper under the topic referenced above and shall submit via email to USARIEM.BMD@AMEDD.ARMY.MIL by 6 July 2010.  The Government shall evaluate all white papers and provide a written response/proposal invitation to the offerors on or about 16 July 2010.   Any questions concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Mr. Michael DAlessandro at the above address or via email to Mike.Dalessandro@us.army.mil. The Natick BAA is effective from 1 April 2009 through 31 March 2011.  It is anticipated that cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.   This synopsis expires 30 Jul 2010.

<RESPDATE>070610
<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a contract with C-Motion, Inc., 420030 Century Blvd, Ste 104A, Germantown, MD, 20874-1112.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Lab Division (HELD) has a requirement for Markerless Motion Capture algorithms directly within Visual3D biomechanical modeling software in support of a Portable Biomechanical Assessment Suite (PBAS) for use in occupational field setting, capable of quantifying risk factors for low-back musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this project is to develop Markerless Motion Capture algorithms in support of a Portable Biomechanical Assessment Suite (PBAS) for use in field settings, capable of quantifying risk factors for low-back musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs. Musculoskeletal disorders involving the low-back are recognized as an important occupational health issue across all industry sectors (Marras, Cutlip, Burt, &amp; Waters, 2009). Laboratory-based human motion studies, including kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces), have quantified exposures for biomechanical risk factors contributing to MSDs, but no practical, full-body, motion capture systems exist for field studies. Among others, candidate portable sensors include inertial measurement units (IMUs) and markerless motion capture (MMC), but each has important limitations. Two-dimensional (2D) IMUs combine accelerometers and rate gyroscopes to provide body kinematics with respect to two horizontal axes. Three-dimensional (3D) IMUs add magnetometers to provide kinematics with respect to a vertical axis, but these are adversely affected by metallic objects and magnetic fields (Roetenberg, Luinge, Baten, &amp; Veltink, 2005). MMC is based upon observational video, and while several techniques are being explored, visual hulls with joint constraints appear to be the most promising (Mundermann, Corazza, &amp; Andriacchi, 2006). Limitations include the need for feature rich clothing, uncluttered background images, and a priori knowledge of anticipated body kinematics.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Health Effects Laboratory Division, Engineering and Control Technology Branch (NIOSH) successfully developed a prototype PBAS, based upon 2D IMUs, capable of assessing sagittal plane joint kinematics and kinetics while assuming bilateral symmetry. The need exists to further develop this prototype, enabling it to assess 3D kinematics and kinetics for all major joints of the body, with no assumptions regarding symmetry. Continued use of IMUs alone would necessitate the addition of magnetometers to obtain rotations of body segments about the vertical (gravity) axis. Because magnetometers are adversely affected by ferromagnetic objects, and these are common in the workplace, we propose to augment 2D IMU data using MMC technologies.</p>
<p>Task 1 (expected duration 12 months): The purpose of this work segment is to produce a computer simulation environment directly within Visual3D biomechanical modeling software (C-Motion, Inc., Rockville MD, USA), that will allow virtual testing of various MMC algorithms. To seed this development, experimental data are needed, and these will be provided by NIOSH. Biomechanics staff at NIOSH will conduct human subject studies of select industrial tasks to provide the contractor with laboratory-based observational video, full-body kinematics and kinetics (via a Vicon motion capture system), and simultaneous 2D IMU data. The contractor will select appropriate video cameras, implement published algorithms for 3D volume linearization and visual hulls, and use the NIOSH data set to create a computer-based simulation environment of known motion. Stand-alone deliverables include a report on the success of this work segment, software algorithms directly within Visual3D to implement the computer-based simulation environment at NIOSH, and a tutorial of sufficient detail for NIOSH to independently use the computer-based simulation environment for its own development of MMC, should funding for Optional Work Segments be unavailable.</p>
<p>Option 1: Task 2 (expected duration 12 months): The purpose of this work segment is to refine the computer-based simulation environment in parallel with testing of a human surrogate (i.e., a mannequin). The contractor will refine the computer-based simulation environment of known motion, in which MMC algorithms will be implemented and integrated with 2D IMU data (sagittal joint motions), to produce desired full-body kinematics for surrogate human forms (i.e., mannequins). Stand-alone deliverables include the mannequins used to accomplish the goals of this work segment, and a report of sufficient detail for NIOSH to independently use the mannequins for its own development of MMC, should funding for Optional Work Segments be unavailable.</p>
<p>Option 2: Tasks 3 and 4 (expected duration 12 months): The purpose of this work segment is to assess the performance of MMC using human subjects. In Task 3, The contractor will provide MMC support for laboratory and field tests of a prototype PBAS that combines 2D IMU data and MMC. This prototype will be validated at NIOSH through additional laboratory-based human subject tests, comparing industrial task kinematics and kinetics obtained from the prototype PBAS and the Vicon system. The prototype will be refined based upon results of the validation tests, and laboratory-based comparisons will be repeated. In Task 4, a prototype will be deployed in at least two field settings for feasibility tests. Stand-alone deliverables include a report detailing the success of MMC in this context, and a User's Guide detailing how to blend 2D IMU data with MMC, to obtain desired biomechanical output directly from Visual3D (especially 3D body kinematics).</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to C-Motion, Inc. under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are hereby afforded the opportunity to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward capabilities and all other information to Diane Meeder, Contract Specialist, CDC, Procurement and Grants Branch-V, PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email Dmeeder@cdc.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals; however, the Government will review any/all product, capabilities, and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with C-Motion, Inc., 420030 Century Blvd, Ste 104A, Germantown, MD, 20874-1112. <br />as the only source.</p>

J&A FAR 6.302-1 - Services to provide a White Nose Captive Bat Breeding Workshop to be held at the the St. Louis Zoo.

1. Organization:  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Regional Office, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345.
2. Description of Action: 	a. Requirement: New	b. Pricing: Firm-Fixed Price	c. Funds: 11134WNS
3. Description of Item/Service:   Facilitation of National Workshop to Investigate the Feasibility of the Captive Propagation of Insectivorous Bats in Response to White-nose Syndrome (WNS).
4. Name of Intended Contractor:Conservation Breeding Specialist Group12101 Johnny Cake Ridge RoadApple Valley, MN 55124
5. Statutory Authority: The authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), which is cited under FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.
6. Justification/Reason for Soliciting Only One Source:   The Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) is a well-known and respected organization that specializes in the conservation and population ecology of threatened and endangered species, including the maintenance of populations of such species in captivity.  They have over 20 years of experience in the preparation of population viability analyses (PVA), population and habitat viability assessments (PHVA), conservation management plans and species action plans through specialized workshops.  They have completed over 140 such workshops to date, including many for offices within the Fish and Wildlife Service's Southeast Region.  Their staff is also uniquely qualified to address (and facilitate discussion on) emergency conservation actions, such as captive propagation, for bats affected by WNS, because of their broad knowledge of the species, conservation strategies, and unique contacts within the zoological community.  They successfully completed similar workshops for the Service in previous years, one focusing on the development of triggers for captive propagation of endangered Virginia big-eared bats in 2009, and one investigating the feasibility of captive propagation for endangered beach mice in 2007.  Both of these workshops aided the Service with key conservation decisions.  For these reasons, we feel that CBSG is uniquely qualified to conduct this extremely important workshop focusing on the feasibility of captive propagation for insectivorous, cave dwelling bats in response to WHS beach mouse captive breeding feasibility workshop.
	a. What harm will come to the Government is desired supplies/services are not provided on time?  The potential loss of large numbers of federal trust wildlife resources (bats).  WNS is responsible for the death of an estimated 1 to 2 million bats in the NE USA, and is spreading rapidly though the rest of the country.  This workshop is needed to provide FWS with critical information regarding captive propagation/holding in response to WNS.  
	b. What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor does not receive the award?  The Government would have to look for other facilitation options involving personnel less skilled that does not have extensive experience with imperiled mammal workshops and captive propagation feasibility studies.  This would affect the quality of the final product.
7.  Action to Increase Competition:	a: No action will be taken due to limited source.
8.  Market Survey: The market survey consisted of discussing facilitation options within the WNS captive propagation workgroup (10 Fish & Wildlife Service Biologists from 4 Regions).  We determined that CGSG was uniquely qualified to handle this workshop.
9.  Procurement History: 	a: Previous contract/order number: N/A	b: Previously competed: N/A	c: Previous authority for less than Full & Open Competition: N/A
10.  Price Reasonableness: The quoted price ($8,700.00) includes extensive planning with the WNS captive propagation group, preparation/dissemination of pre-workshop materials, travel and expenses, facilitation of a 2.5 day workshop, and completion of a post workshop report.  This will take approximately 2 to 3 weeks (80 to 120 hours) of work.  Estimating $1,200.00 for travel and expenses, the work would constitute a range of $62 to $93 per hour, a rate that is extremely reasonable give the level of effort and expertise and in comparison with the independent government estimate.
11. Technical Certification: This justification is accurate to the best of our knowledge.

<DESC>The U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase to Washingtion State University.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska requires the services of captive feeding trials to improve the use of fatty acids and stable isotopes for diet determinatoin in polar bears.
Dr. Charlie Robbins with Washington State University has over 20 years of experience conducting feeding experiments and studies the nutritional ecology in ursids.  His work has been published in over 20 scientific journals and he currently houses 10 captive brown bears.  Dr. Charlie Robbins has the setup ready to conduct the requested services.
Work description:
Polar bears comprise a clearly-defined fifth trophic level in the Arctic marine food web. Because of their long life spans and vast home ranges (Amstrup et al. 2000), polar bears are affected by ecosystem processes operating over multiple temporal and spatial scales. For instance, long-term changes in sea ice conditions in Hudson Bay have had significant negative effects on polar bear body condition, reproduction and population size (Stirling et al. 1999, Regehr et al. 2007). However, short-term, year-to-year changes in the sea ice habitat can also significantly affect polar bear body condition, reproduction, and behaviour (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Stirling et al. 1999). Although the broad-scale foraging success of polar bears will be closely related to the productivity and availability of their main prey, ringed seals (Phoca hispida; Stirling and ritsland 1995), polar bears will prey substantively on locally-abundant prey such as beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas; Lowry et al. 1987), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus; Bentzen et al. 2007), walrus (Odobenus rosmarus; Thiemann et al. 2008a), and harp seal (Phoca groenlandica; Derocher et al. 2002, Iverson et al. 2006, Thiemann et al. 2008a). As the climate and sea ice regime of the circumpolar Arctic continues to change, further short- and long-term shifts in polar bear diets should be expected.
Two relatively new biochemical approaches have provided important insights into the diets of free-ranging predators, including polar bears. Stable isotope analysis is based on the predictable incorporation of naturally-occurring isotopes of carbon and nitrogen present in different food sources. Fatty acid signature analysis is based on the knowledge that ingested fatty acids are predictably incorporated into the adipose tissue of consumers. Both approaches can be integrated into statistical models that generate quantitative estimates of predator diets. However, both techniques also have limitations that are largely a consequence of an incomplete understanding of predator metabolism and nutritional physiology. This study aims to address these conceptual shortcomings and provide new insights into polar bear ecophysiology. The results of this work will improve our ability to accurately estimate the diets of free-ranging polar bears.  This study will estimate fractionation values of N and C and fatty acid coefficients and the potential effects of variation in dietary fat to protein ratios and fasting behavior required to more accurately determine prey composition.   Goals: The goals of this project are to:  
1. Estimate isotopic fractionation values and fatty acid coefficients that are representative of tissue deposition occurring from typical diets consumed by wild polar bears.  2. Determine the potential effects of variation in fat intake on isotopic fractionation values, fatty acid coefficients, and energy requirements.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 3, Division of Construction and Acquisition at Ft. Snelling, Minnesota, intends to procure  a self-powered rotary screw design fish trap on a sole-source basis from E.G. Solutions, Inc., of Corvallis, Oregon. Invasive sea lampreys in the great lakes basin parasitize and kill lake trout, whitefish, lake sturgeon and other species. One adult sea lamprey can kill up to 40 lbs. of fish per year. The sea lamprey management program in the great lakes basin is an international program designed to control sea lamprey populations through trapping and other means in support of a fishery valued at $4-6 billion annually. The Service intends to procure a fish trap from E.G. Solutions, the sole licensed manufacturer of self-powered fish traps with a rotary screw design under U.S. patent 4,929,350. The fish trap available from E.G. Solutions, Inc. has been used to capture migrating parasitic phase lamprey in the Canadian waters of the great lakes. There are other fish traps available on the market, but they do not have the same design that has shown to be successful for the unique purpose of trapping parasitic phase sea lamprey. It is anticipated that the self-powered rotary screw design fish trap will enhance sea lamprey control efforts because it will be able to operate 24 hours a day, is self-cleaning and can adjust to changing water conditions because it floats. The trap is also capable of being utilized in a wide range of water velocities, does not injure fish and is lightweight and can be disassembled for easy transportation.

A determination by the Government not to compete this additional work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><br />SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The following document is prepared in accordance with FAR 13</p>
<p>1. A description of supplies of services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>MODIFICATION TO EXISTING CONTRACT FOR ADDITIONAL EXCAVATION AND SAMPLING/ANLAYSIS DUE TO THE DISCOVERY OF DIOXIN CONTAMINATION IN ORIGNALLY EXCAVATED WASTE PILES.</p>
<p>The existing contract is for the remediation of a post &amp; pole treatment site that had undergone a previous contaminated soil removal project in the early 1990's. To obtain liability insurance, the site now requires additional excavation work to remove dioxin contaminated soils in order to meet cleanup standards protective of human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The modification is necessary for additional excavation and sampling/analysis due to the discovery of dioxin contamination when the original pile of waste soil was being characterized for disposal. A positive result for dioxin contamination at the previously excavated area now requires that the extent of the contamination be determined for the final soil removal phase.</p>
<p>Estimated (quote) $34,000</p>
<p>2. An identification of the statutory authority:</p>
<p>FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a Single Source.</p>
<p>3. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>The current contractor is experienced with conducting environmental remediation activities using the required Independent Cleanup Process (ICP) under the State of Wyoming Voluntary Remediation Program (VRP). This contractor is involved with specific requirements including coordination with the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), submission of workplans for State assurance for the site. The contractor has recently received State approval of a workplan for the Phase II Investigation plan to continue with excavation for specific sampling and analysis necessary to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the dioxin contamination. The current contractor has reviewed and is familiar with all previous reports from the earlier remediation activities and current data in order to determine the location for the proposed excavation. Previously excavated soils have tested positive for dioxins contamination and are awaiting disposal. The stockpiled soils will be included with the soils from the final excavation for off-site disposal by incineration at a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility. The current contractor has applied for and acquired approval for disposal of these soils through a coordinated process between the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility.</p>
<p>Any change in contractors for this project would require the preparation and approval of new workplans by the Wyoming DEQ to continue the site investigation and soil removal under the ICP program and the coordination/approval by EPA to secure transportation and disposal by incineration of the additional dioxin contaminated soils that will be excavated.</p>
<p>4. A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required in Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:</p>
<p>The sole source notice for the contract modification will be advertised on the Federal Business Opportunity website.</p>
<p>5. Identification of single source:</p>
<p>Northwest Technologies, Inc.<br />11911 W. Franklin Road<br />Boise, ID 83709</p>
<p><br />I hereby certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>DESCRIPTION:  Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Research & Development effort in support of the Reconfigurable Rotors program.  The Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments.  <BR><BR>INTRODUCTION:  The Active Rotor Component Demonstration Broad Agency Announcement supports the Reconfigurable Rotor program by demonstrating high performance rotor system enabling technologies to support current and future Army Aviation platforms.  The Reconfigurable Rotors Program is a 4 year 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration effort.   The goal of the Reconfigurable Rotors program is to provide improved rotorcraft performance throughout the flight envelope resulting in significantly increased mission capability and survivability through optimization of integrated active and passive rotor features.  The overall program objectives are to demonstrate significant improvements in rotor figure of merit and cruise efficiency (isolated rotor L/De), reductions in rotor vibration levels, and reductions in acoustic signature range.  This program has been broken up into two phases.  The first phase, called Active Rotor Component Demonstration, is a 12 month effort to identify and address the technology challenges and approaches associated with achievement of the Reconfigurable Rotors program objectives.  The enabling technologies developed and matured under this Active Rotor Component Demonstration phase will then be candidates for the planned second phase of the Reconfigurable Rotors program to demonstrate significant performance improvements at the integrated, full scale rotor system level.  This BAA is for the Active Rotor Component Demonstration phase only and will mature those technologies judged most critical to achieve overall program goals.<BR><BR>SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There is one topic under this announcement:  <BR><BR>TOPIC 01-2010:  Active Rotor Component Demonstration<BR><BR>Current Army rotor systems do not meet the performance requirements (including range, payload, and vibration) and survivability (such as acoustic signature) levels for future missions.  Current active rotor efforts are maturing individual component technologies but progress has been hampered by constraints that arise from trying to incorporate new features into existing rotor designs.  These constraints include high centrifugal force (CF) loading on hub components, limited hub motion freedom, and space available in the spar while still maintaining structural integrity and load path continuity.   There is a limit to the performance improvements possible throughout the entire flight envelope when retro-fitting these systems with active components.  Also, current passive rotor designs are often the result of compromises due to different optimum designs for, among others, hover efficiency versus cruise efficiency, low acoustic signature versus high performance, or the advancing versus the retreating side of the rotor disk.  The Reconfigurable Rotors program addresses the need to develop and demonstrate an optimized clean sheet active/passive advanced, appropriately scaled, rotor that avoids the many short comings of retrofitting on-blade actuators to current rotor systems.  An integrated flight control system will also be required as part of any next generation rotor.<BR><BR>The goals of the Reconfigurable Rotors program are to demonstrate technologies that, when compared to baseline fielded Army rotor system, will:<BR><BR>"	Reduce rotor vibrations by at least 90%;<BR>"	Reduce acoustic signature range by 50%; <BR>"	Increase rotor figure of merit by 10%; and<BR>"	Increase cruise efficiency (isolated rotor L/De) by 8%.<BR><BR>The enabling technologies matured and demonstrated under this topic should directly address one or more of these overall program goals. Technologies of interest for this topic include, but are not limited to, advanced active leading edge slat actuation, next generation rotor hubs designed to accommodate blades with on-blade controls, innovative wiring concepts, unique spar designs to accommodate in-blade actuators, low power on-blade actuation concepts, regenerative power, morphing tips, passive technologies that enable active technologies (and vice versa), and multiple/segmented trailing edge flaps for improved performance.<BR><BR>The enabling technologies shall be compatible with the operational environment, to include at a minimum, sand and rain erosion, icing, EMI, wide operating temperature range, and battle damage assessment and repair (BDAR), with minimal impact to the baseline vulnerability, susceptibility, reliability, and maintainability. The unique challenges in reliably transferring the required data and power across the rotating frame (rotating component to static airframe) shall also be considered.                                                                                                                                                             A suitable risk mitigation plan (to include analytical tools and facilities required) shall be developed that defines a building-block, analysis and test approach that culminates in full-scale validation of the technology.  A technology maturation and transition plan shall also be developed as part of the effort to ensure the enabling technologies are applicable to the next phase of the Reconfigurable Rotors program.<BR><BR>ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated funding is $3.5M (FY11 funding). The baseline Period of Performance for Topic 01 is not to exceed 12 months.  In addition, offerors may propose a 6 month option for FY12 to further mature and demonstrate enabling technologies.  Options are at the discretion of the proposers; therefore options will not be evaluated.<BR><BR>Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule.  The topic has the potential for multiple awards, which may address only part of the topics objectives.  Any government award is subject to the availability of funds.  <BR><BR>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIA's or OT(s) it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the offerors desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.  <BR><BR>DATA ITEMS / DELIVERABLES:  All awards under this announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.

It is the offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments desire for at least Government Purpose Rights.  <BR><BR>PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  <BR><BR>Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  <BR><BR>Proposals:  The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume.   In presenting the proposal material, prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  Offerors may submit proposals. <BR><BR>PROPOSAL TECHNICAL VOLUME:  The technical volume of the proposal shall provide detail that justifies the benefits of the proposed technology relative to the topic objectives, and a plan to develop and transition the technology to current or future Army aircraft. The technical volume shall also include a clear statement of the technical objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience. It shall contain a Statement of Work (SOW), milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources to be employed in the effort, and a program management section. Offerors shall identify and substantiate the beginning and ending Technology Readiness Levels. <BR><BR>Volume I (Technical) shall be written and shall consist of a maximum of fifty pages exclusive of title page, section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices.  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages specified. Submission shall be limited to the number of pages specified, total inclusive of any drawings, charts, etc.  Type shall be no smaller than a font size of ten (10) and shall be at least single spaced.  Page size shall not exceed 8  x 11.  Fold-out illustrations required for reader ease are allowed, however, illustration shall be counted in 8  x 11 increments (e.g., a 11 x 17 document will count as two pages).   Except for the Technical Volume, the number of proposal pages is not limited.<BR><BR>PROPOSAL COST VOLUME:  Within the Cost Proposal, offerors shall indicate the proposed funding instrument (e.g., FAR-based contract and type (cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost reimbursable, etc.) or TIA).  The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown providing man-hours and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, travel and equipment and materials listings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractor's submission.  Any cost share will be calculated as follows: contractor cash plus in-kind contribution divided by project value.  Any resulting agreement value will exclude recipient's sunk costs of prior research as cost match. Only additional resources that will be provided by the recipient to carry out the current project will be counted.  <BR><BR>SUBCONTRACTING PLAN:  Not applicable if proposing award under a non-FAR instrument (i.e. Technology Investment Agreement) or if the offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $550,000, and there are subcontracting possibilities, offerors must submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the offerors proposal submission.  DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontracting incentive and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appropriate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219-7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contract related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunities exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD<BR><BR>Proposal Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The ratings/narrative will be used to develop an order of merit listing for each topic.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.<BR><BR>   The following evaluation criteria will apply: <BR><BR>	(1) Relevance of the Proposed Technologies.  This will include how the benefits of the technology align with program objectives, the potential for integration into a complete rotor system, and the technology readiness timeline.<BR><BR>	(2) The Merit of the Proposed Technical Approach.  This includes understanding of the problem and current technical challenges to include at a minimum, the service environment and rotorcraft system constraints (space, weight, and power),  how the proposed solution addresses those challenges,  understanding of the current TRL level of the proposed technology,  an understanding of integration constraints, the reasonableness of the proposed tasks (to include the test and evaluation approach, concept tradeoffs, and design optimization), and schedule to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives and metrics.<BR><BR>       (3) Ability to Transition Technology. This includes the extent to which the technology will be available for follow-on system development to include at a minimum data rights, partnerships and teaming, capability to accomplish the technology transition to include the experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, the availability of (or the ability to generate) required technical and test data to validate the technology, and a clear and reasonable technology maturation and transition plan. <BR><BR> 	(4) The reasonableness of the proposed cost to the Government of the proposed tasks. This includes the realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed individual tasks and the overall effort. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  This also includes the cost to Government of any required GFE/GFI or facilities.<BR><BR>Criteria (1), (2) and (3) are equal and more important than (4). <BR><BR>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  No pre-proposal conference is to be held.   Proposal will be considered valid for 210 days from the date that this announcement closes unless specifically stated otherwise.

<DESC>FULL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ATTACHED<br /><br />All current DoD sensors, platforms, and missions heavily depend on computer systems - from in-field distributed sensors to complex weapons system simulations. To meet the relentlessly increasing demands for greater performance, higher energy efficiency, ease of programmability, system dependability, and security, revolutionary new research, development, and design will be essential to enable new generations of advanced DoD computing system capabilities and new classes of computer applications. Current evolutionary approaches to progress in computer designs are inadequate. To pursue these capabilities, DARPA is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Omnipresent High Performance Computing (OHPC) program. Novel proposals for research and development in technical areas and for approaches that will dramatically advance the performance and capabilities of future computing systems and enable ExtremeScale computing are sought. Evolutionary research will not be selectable. This solicitation is intended to provide novel technologies and approaches that provide significant advances for the system design activities being performed under the DARPA Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) program.
<p>For additional background information, definitions, UHPC vision and goals, and specifically the technical challenges of designing and building UHPC systems see DARPA-BAA-10-37 (http://www.darpa.mil/tcto/solicitations.html). The material found under the UHPC solicitation, DARPA-BAA-10-37, will not be repeated in the OHPC solicitation.<br />The OHPC program will research, develop and document novel and revolutionary technologies and designs critical to the development of highly efficient, highly programmable and dependable UHPC systems. The anticipated time frame for prototype UHPC systems is 2018.</p>
<p>The goals of the OHPC program include supplementing the technologies being developed in the UHPC program. The purpose of this effort is to accelerate the performance and capabilities of UHPC program systems through selected, critical research and development activities that have high impact on ExtremeScale computing and specifically UHPC program systems, up to but not necessarily including whole-system prototype development. Instead, OHPC activities may focus on technology and science subareas and subproblems that are critical to the overall UHPC program goals. The goals and vision of UHPC are set forth in DARPA-BAA-10-37. The co-design of the hardware and software is an important aspect of both the OHPC and UHPC programs.</p>
<p>The technologies developed under the OHPC program should make a significant contribution to ExtremeScale systems, cover all aspects of the system design, and are scalable to UHPC or ExaScale computing (as defined in the UHPC solicitation, DARPA-BAA-10-37). It is anticipated that OHPC designs and technologies will be integrated into one or more UHPC systems during the course of the OHPC program.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull;Research on hardware, software and algorithms for reducing and/or managing power requirements for high performance computing systems, including the memory and storage hierarchy</p>
<p>&bull;Research on hardware, software and language design that enables highly programmable systems, which reduces the need for users to be aware of system complexity, including heterogeneous cores, the memory hierarchy, etc.</p>
<p>&bull;Research on hardware and software for improving system dependability, managing the component failure rate, and security compromises including approaches for shared information and responsibility among the OS, runtime system, and applications</p>
<p>&bull;Research on scalable I/O systems, which may include alternatives to file systems</p>
<p>&bull;Research on self aware system software, including operating system, runtime system, I/O system, system management/administration, resource management and means of exposing resources, and external environments</p>
<p>&bull;Programming models that allow developers to express their execution goals for achieving security, dependability, power efficiency and high performance</p>
<p>&bull;Research on low power circuits that can be used across multiple UHPC or ExtremeScale system designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;FULL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ATTACHED</p>

The infrastructure being implemented at ESOC West is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the ESOC East.This establishment of ESOC West is a key component of the Data Center Consolidation program.  ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide the network monitoring appliances required to ensure that users can access their applications across the wide area network.  The devices will be used to monitor network utilization, project capacity requirements, and troubleshoot issues. This acquisition is one of several to establish the ESOC West IT infrastructure. The architecture will be a replica of the IT infrastructure already in production at ESOC East.  It will use the same suite of products in use at ESOC East to ensure compatibility across enclaves and to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer lights-out ESOCs.  41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<p>PART 3: STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>3.1 Background</p>
<p>The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requires the production of one (1) milligram each of 34 scFv antibodies against the following allergens: German cockroach (2), Neurospora crassa (4), Agarigus bisporus (21), and Nicotiana benthamiana/excelsiana (7). The plasmids encoding these specific antibodies have already been generated. These plasmids are in the possession of CBER and Creative Dynamics Inc, Shirley, NY.</p>
<p>This work will be performed as part of the development of the multiplex allergen extract potency assay (MAEPA). CBER is currently in the process of developing and optimizing MAEPA for less complex allergen mixtures and is ready to move into more complex mixtures such as the cockroach allergen extract. The development of this assay will be an important step towards analyzing the allergenicity of cockroach extract as well as many other extracts currently on the market that do not have a standard of potency. We are also working to evaluate potential allergens that may exist and co-purify with vaccines produced in novel expression systems. A human scFv library used to screen these extracts will be expected to enable us to find allergens relevant to humans.<br /><br />3.2 Objective</p>
<p>The FDAs objective is to obtain one milligram (1mg) each of 34 scFv's in order to assess the overall potency of complex allergen mixtures.</p>
<p><br />3.3 Technical Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>One milligram (1 mg) each of 34 designated scFv's. The scFv's will be soluble, tagged (His and Myc), in aqueous solution, at a purity of &gt;98%. Aside from the specified His and Myc tags, the scFv antibody should be free of fusion constructs. In order to achieve this, the encoding DNA shall be cloned into an appropriate expression vector, optimized, and expressed under optimal conditions. The expressed scFv shall be tested for allergen binding and purified. In most cases the encoding DNA will have to be optimized; contractor should note that 30 of the provided sequences contain amber stop codons. <br />1. Antibody expression construct for each of the 34 scFv's. See list below.<br />2. ELISA data supporting scFv binding to each antigen.<br />3. scFv antibody sequence, inferred from expression construct DNA sequence.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a firm fixed price contract for The Average Effect Estimation Accounting Covariate Measurement Error New Casual Model Technique with Medical Device Application. The Impact of Breast Pump Use on Mother's Breast Feeding Practice and Infant Health&nbsp;Specifications in reference to this solicitation are listed as follows:<br /><br />Statement&nbsp; of Work</p>
<p>Title: Average Treatment Effect Estimation Accounting for Covariate Measurement Error<br />- New causal model technique with a medical device application: the Impact of Breast Pump Use on Mother's Breast-Feeding Practice and Infant's Health</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, ignoring measurement error in covariates (a fairly common issue) may lead to misleading inferences on average treatment or exposure effects evaluation in non-randomized studies. Although an analysis based on a carefully conducted, randomized and controlled clinical trial is still the gold standard in obtaining valid causal effects of medical products, such designs can be either impractical or too burdensome to conduct in pre-market and post-market studies. For example, for medical devices, it is not uncommon to have a non-randomized design for the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study in the premarket phase; and very frequently a prospective, controlled cohort design is used for the Post-approval Study (PAS) of medical devices at the post-market phase. Average causal effect (ACE) estimation methods for these non-randomized studies have typically relied on standard propensity scoring techniques under the traditional causal framework, which assumes all covariates are measured accurately and no unobserved factors influence the treatment and outcome (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983,1984; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). However, covariates are often measured with unobservable error, which violates the critical assumption underlying the current causal framework. Since ignoring the error often leads to significant biased results, extending the standard causal inference framework allowing covariate measurement error and developing appropriate estimation methods are of critical importance for a valid assessment of the safety and efficacy of medical products (including devices, drugs, and biologics) in both the pre-market and post-market phases.</p>
<p>From an application point of view, the breast pump is a medical device regulated by CDRH and broadly used in US. A study has shown that 85% of mothers who breastfed infants that were 1.5-4.5 months old used a breast pump. However, little is known about how mothers' experiences with breast pumps, including both benefits and adverse events, impact their breast feeding practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants receive breast milk throughout the first year of their life. Therefore, it is important to know how the mother's breast feeding practice associated with the use of a breast pump and how the breast pump usage influences the infant's health. However, some important confounders, e.g. household social economic status and mother's post-natal health status, are either unobservable or liable to measurement error. The presence of measurement error in covariates violates the critical assumption underlying the current causal framework, which need new causal methods to address these two important questions. In this project, we plan to use IFPS II data (Infant Feeding Practices Study II) (Fein, 2008), a major longitudinal study conducted by FDA in collaboration with CDC, NIH, DHHS/OWH, and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The data have been analyzed for presentation at the annual meetings of the American Public Health Association in November 2007 and were published in a journal supplement in 2008.</p>
<p><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this requisition is to procure appropriate source to: (1) develop a causal inference framework to allow covariate measurement error; (2) develop a new causal inference model for average treatment effect estimation accounting for the measurement error structure under non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies; and (3) apply this new causal model on the evaluation of the health impact of breast pump usage using IFPS II data.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br />&bull; develop a new statistical methodology to: <br />o create a causal inference framework to allow for covariate measurement error. <br />o develop an average treatment effect (ATE) estimation model under the new causal framework that accounts for covariate measurement error, based on existing propensity score methodology.<br />o conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new method over the currently used propensity score-based causal inference method.<br />&bull; participate in developing and writing manuscripts describing the extended causal framework and the proposed new estimation methods. <br />&bull; conduct the data analysis, using IFPS II data, to evaluate the health impact of breast pump usage on mother's breast feeding behavior and infants' health status using the newly developed causal inference model and conventional propensity score-based causal inference method.<br />&bull; participate in writing manuscripts describing the impact of breast pump use on Mother and infant health. <br />&bull; submit the final report/documentation of the developed new Causal Inference Methodology.</p>
<p>Timeline with Major Milestones and Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit the following: (all submissions shall be electronic)</p>
<p>1) Statistical plan of developing a new causal inference methodology to allow covariate measurement error, and the documentation for the development of estimation methods.<br />2) Manuscript for the development of average treatment effect (ATE) model under the proposed causal framework accounting for covariate measurement error. <br />3) Data analysis results for the evaluation of the impact of breast pump usage on mother and infant health using IFPS II data. <br />4) The SAS or statistical programs used to analyze the data, and an interpretation of the results. <br />5) Final report and documentation of new Causal Inference Methodology and its application on the study of Breast Pump Use.</p>

The modernized Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS) will incorporate risk-based, preventive control measures for ensuring the safety of animal feed.</p>
<p>The work of the AFSS Team is guided by a Framework Document, first drafted in 2005, that identifies the current processes, guidance, regulations and policy documents that address feed safety and the documents that should be developed to make the Agency's feed safety program comprehensive and risk-based. The Framework Document has been revised three times and will undergo additional revisions as needed.</p>
<p>One of the gaps identified in the AFSS Framework Document is the need for a more comprehensive animal feed safety program in the United States. To address that gap, the AFSS Team has written process control regulations that cover receipt, manufacture and distribution of all animal feed, including pet food and feed ingredients. These proposed regulations are presently in Agency clearance.</p>
<p>Critical to each step in the process is the identification of potential feed hazards and the implementation of steps to ensure that the hazards are controlled so they do not present an unacceptable risk to animal or human health. The FDA plans to release guidance on feed hazard identification and control to assist manufacturers and transporters of animal feed to comply with this requirement and thereby ensure the safety of their feed products. One challenge in drafting the proposed rule is defining terms in a way that takes into account the fact that the presence of certain feed hazards in animal feed or the existence of certain conditions offered does not always pose a significant risk to animal or human health.</p>
<p>Duties</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide expert services to the Center for Veterinary Medicine <br />(CVM) for development of guidance for industry which explain how to identify feed <br />Hazards of concern and steps to control the presence offered hazards in feed products so <br />animal or human health is not compromised. Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the timely drafting of guidance documents and efficient revision of the <br />documents based on comments from the AFSS Team.</p>
<p>The Contractor should have extensive experience and knowledge regarding the presence offered hazards in animal feed and the measures the feed industry has at its disposal for handling such hazards. The Contractor needs to understand the principles of risk and relative risk assessment. Also, the Contractor needs wide-ranging knowledge of the regulatory and stakeholder groups that could be impacted by the guidance. Furthermore, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of the feed industry as it currently exists</p>
<p>and operates, as well as the goals, objectives and premises of the AFSS. The Contractor will need to be available to travel on occasion.</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>The work will take place at the contractor's place of business and on occasion at CVM, 7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD. <br />Equipment - Use No government funded nor extraordinary equipment is needed.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria <br />A.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Compunetix,Inc., PA to procure Digital Conferencing Switch, Maintenance, and Administrationterminals, per the enclosed documents.Last item.NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Compunetix. It would take a substantialduplication of time and effort for another company to provide comparable switches, andthose costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The procurement of the MOCS-3 Upgrade must be sole-sourced to the Compunetix Corporationdue to the following:The upgrade must be compatible with the existing NASA Model-3 End Instruments.	There arepresently 339 NASA Model-3 End Instruments in use on the existing MOCS-2 voice system. These end instruments were developed by NASA to interface with the existing CompunetixCT-500 digital conferencing switch and meet the requirements of the NASA users and theircustomers.   The new Compunetix Digital Conferencing Switch remains communicationscompatible with these End Instruments.	Due to the Compunetix proprietary interfacebetween the Digital Switch and the NASA Model-3 End Instruments, it would not be feasibleto re-engineer these end instruments to communicate with a different vendors equipment. Therefore the award of this procurement to another vendor would require the replacementof all 339 end instruments resulting in excessive additional cost to the Government.  Choosing another vendor would introduce unacceptable delays in terms of time, and testingto ensure mission success.  Additional costs would also be incurred in coordinatingperforming and evaluating such a compatibility test.  Using another system wouldintroduce unacceptable risk that may lead to mission failure or undue public safetyissues.The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 ofthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquirea commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their quotation or capabilities and qualifications toperform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00p.m. local time on July 5, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsiblesources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman hasbeen appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The provisions and clauses in the RFP are those in effect through FAC 2005-39The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334290 and750 employees respectively.

<DESC><p>Insurance Coverage</p>
<p>Management/Office of Fine Arts (M/FA)<br />U.S. Department of State</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's Office of Fine Arts requires insurance coverage (at a firm fixed price) for its fine and decorative arts collection. The insurance shall provide protection against loss or physical damage to the objects which are a permanent part of the collection, as well as to the objects on temporary loan to the U.S. Department of State by various private citizens or organizations. The coverage shall include terrorism protection.</p>
<p>The property value of the fine and decorative arts collection owned by the U.S. Department of State and the fine and decorative arts collection on loan by the general public to the U.S. Department of State is estimated to be $64,795,172. (See Attachment "A" which lists the permanent collection and objects on loan to the U.S. Department of State as of January 20, 2010.) The successful offeror shall provide insurance coverage for property values worth $65,000,000 at a firm fixed price. Sixty-five million dollars in insurance coverage provides the U.S. Department of State a $204,828.00 allowance for additions to Attachment "A" (at no additional cost to the U.S. Department of State) over the course of the contract term.</p>
<p>Additionally, a fixed price shall be established for each additional $10,000 of coverage required if the collection within the US Department of State grows or is re-valued beyond the established $65,000,000. If that occurs, an addendum will be added to the contract to cover the new objects at the stated price.</p>
<p>There are smoke detectors and sprinklers in all of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms, the seventh floor State Rooms and the Treaty Room, where the vast majority of the collection resides within the U.S. Department of State located at 2201 C Street, NW, Washington, DC 20520. The objects housed outside of the U.S. Department of State include:</p>
<p>Blair House 21 items approximate value: $355,026<br />War College 1 item approximate value: $2,000<br />White House 1 item approximate value: $3,000<br />National Portrait Gallery 1 item approximate value: $50,000<br />Foreign Service Institute 2 items approximate value: $20,550<br />Keshishian Rug Storage 34 items approximate value: $929,315</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />Major Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p><br />COVERAGE</p>
<p>The fine and decorative arts protection shall include:</p>
<p>1) Zero deductible<br />2) Breakage endorsement<br />3) Replacement value coverage for all risks<br />4) Up to $20,000,000 in door-to-door coverage on scheduled/unscheduled objects that are being shipped or in transit (per occurrence)<br />5) Terrorism coverage.</p>
<p>The insurance coverage shall apply to (1) scheduled objects (Attachment "A") and (2) newly acquired/to be scheduled objects not to exceed the total amount of $65,000,000 worth of values. Newly acquired items shall be covered from the date of acceptance into the permanent collection of the U.S. Department of State or from the date of loan to the U.S. Department of State. Up-dated schedules will be provided to the Contractor within 90 days of the objects being added to the schedule.</p>
<p><br />POINT OF CONTACT</p>
<p>At the time of contract signing, the Contractor shall provide the Office of Fine Arts with a single point of contact, who will serve as the Office of Fine Arts contact for all claims, inquiries and issue resolution.</p>
<p><br />VALUATION</p>
<p>If loss or damage occurs, the Office of Fine Arts will seek an estimate to identify the amount required to repair or replace the object and will provide a copy of the estimate with the claim. All scheduled and to be scheduled property will be insured for replacement value. If the Contractor and the Office of Fine Arts disagree on replacement value, then the amount of loss will be determined as provided by the Appraisal Clause of the policy.</p>
<p><br />SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall pay all claims within 30 days of submission by the Office of Fine Arts.</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />APPRAISAL</p>
<p>If the Government and the Contractor fail to agree as to the amount of loss, each shall, on the written demand of either, made within sixty (60) days after receipt of proof of loss by the Contractor, select a competent and disinterested appraiser, and the appraisal shall be made at a reasonable time and place. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire, and failing for fifteen (15) days to agree upon such umpire, then on the request of the Government or the Contractor, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the State in which this policy is issued. Such appraisers shall appraise the loss, stating separately the actual cash value at the time of loss and the amount of loss, and failing to agree shall submit their differences to the umpire. An award in writing of any two shall determine the amount of loss. The Government and the Contractor shall each pay his or its chosen appraiser and shall bear equally the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire. The Contractor shall not be held to have waived any of its rights by act relating to appraisal.</p>
<p><br />DISCREPANCY BETWEEN CONTRACT AND POLICY</p>
<p>In the event of a conflict between the terms, conditions and clauses in this solicitation/contract and any insurance policy provided by the Contractor under this solicitation/contract, the terms, conditions and clauses in this solicitation/contract shall prevail.</p>

If the selection of a new carrier results in a premium increase/decrease, the U.S. Department of State shall not be responsible for or entitled to such increases/decreases.

<DESC><br />This Senior HIV/AIDS Advisor position is set up to assist in management of the interagency effort set forth by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Haiti. The USAID Health Office manages over $75 million in annual health and AIDS activities, including the joint management of PEPFAR, and coordinates closely with a number of donor agencies and the Haitian Government. This office will also manage additional post-earthquake funds. This position requires close coordination with other components of the overall health program that, due to their integrated nature, receive significant funding from PEPFAR. <br />

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS- UNITED STATES COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO, or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally, or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer, or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency, or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer and the solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their "best" efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer, or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing for urgent and compelling reasons, or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed, or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirements. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, S.W. , Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45MF5 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

<p>judicial challenge.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>15.4 Volume II - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Include all required information, EXCLUDING any reference to price. Each technical proposal must be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete to clearly and fully demonstrate to the government that the offeror has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements. Offerors, which do not present sufficient information to permit complete technical evaluation by the government, may be determined technically unacceptable. Previously submitted data will not be used in the evaluation of proposals. Include all information required by Attachment J.3, Technical Evaluation Criteria.</p>
<p>The proposal shall concisely describe the offeror's response to the requirements of the solicitation. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper or bindings, and expensive visual or other aids are not necessary or encouraged.</p>
<p>15.4.1 Pages containing text shall be typewritten or printed on 8 &frac12; x 11 or 8 x 10 &frac12; inch paper, with at least single spacing.

Proposals shall not be supplemented by a package or reference or reference documents. Pages exceeding the limitations will be removed from the proposal by the Contracting Officer and returned to the offeror to ensure that they are not evaluated. Other deviations from the instructions will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer to ensure that no offeror receives a competitive advantage. Deviations resulting in a competitive advantage for an offeror will result in the proposal being returned to the offeror as noncompliant with the RFP requirements.</p>
<p>15.4.2 All pages in the proposal shall be numbered and identified with the proposal's name (CGC SHERMAN (WHEC 720) Unplanned Dockside Repairs, RFP number, and date of proposal).

<p>52.16-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)<br />The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract.<br />52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996)<br />(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:<br />USCG, Command<br />Surface Forces Logistics Centers<br />LRE-C&amp;PD2<br />1301 Clay Street<br />Oakland, CA 946120<br />(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.<br />52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (Oct 1997) <br />(a) Definition. "Facsimile proposal," as used in this provision, means a proposal, revision or modification of a proposal, or withdrawal of a proposal that is transmitted to and received by the Government via facsimile machine. <br />(b) Offerors may submit facsimile proposals as responses to this solicitation. Facsimile proposals are subject to the same rules as paper proposals. <br />(c) The telephone number of receiving facsimile equipment is: (510) 637-5978. <br />(d) If any portion of a facsimile proposal received by the Contracting Officer is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the solicitation cannot be ascertained from the document- <br />(1) The Contracting Officer immediately shall notify the offeror and permit the offeror to resubmit the proposal; <br />(2) The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the Contracting Officer after consultation with the offeror; and</p>
<p><br />(3) The resubmission shall be considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission for the purpose of determining timeliness, provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements for resubmission prescribed by the Contracting Officer. <br />(e) The Government reserves the right to make award solely on the facsimile proposal. However, if requested to do so by the Contracting Officer, the apparently successful offeror promptly shall submit the complete original signed proposal. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />PRICE -<br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical <br />quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(d) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revi</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following responses to questions posed by potential offerors:
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 1:<br /></strong></span>Can you verify this is actually for 4U and not 40U?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 1:<br /></span></strong>Yes, 4U.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:<br /></span></strong>Are the 44 drives (CLIN 0002) going in the storage device requested in CLIN 001?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 2:<br /></span></strong>Yes, as many of the 44 drives will go into the storage unit that will physically fit. All drives must be supplied with trays, if needed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3:<br /></span></strong>Are you looking for 80TB 42bay unit and an additional qty 44 2TB drives? Do you want those drives to be in drive trays?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response 3:</strong></span><br />The drives were listed out separately from the storage unit. The separate line item drives are expected to populate the storage unit to the maximum physical space.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4:<br /></span></strong>Are you looking for Linux based NAS Head that will connect to 42bay unit? Do you have specs for this NAS Head? I was wondering if you can provide specs on the RAID and the NAS head.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 4:<br /></span></strong>The NAS head is not included with this RFQ. The storage unit must be compatible with the Linux 2.6 kernel.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0005, Effective Date 21 June 2010Contractor Questions and Government Answers:QUESTION:  What are the utility requirements for the facility including power,water, fire water, and sanitary sewer?ANSWER:  No utility requirements.QUESTION:  Are any water heater systems needed in the enclosures?ANSWER:  Not in this contract.QUESTION:  What kind of fire protection system is required for the facility?ANSWER:  None, Government will install extinguishers and fire hose.QUESTION:  Where is the PAK (post award kick-off) meeting held? Bangor WAor San Diego CA?ANSWER:  Contractor's site.QUESTION:  Was any concept design or analysis performed for forcestransferred to the existing Delta pier piling and forces and displacements oftheanchor system?  Are there any chances for the existing pier piling subjected toany higher loading conditions than the own capacity.ANSWER:  The three steel pilings were originally installed to support a 8' x60'concrete boat dock so analysis would have been done in the past.  TheGovernment can provide the installation drawings for the pilings and concreteboat dock upon request.  The Government is not currently aware of anyanalysis report but will attempt to locate one if it exists.  The concretepilingswere installed to support the above structure and have had no other loadingconditions in the past.  The size of the concrete anchors were determined bynon-formal load estimations of the mammal facility.  Don't expect that thepilings will be subjected to higher loading conditions than their own capacitybutit is unknown, therefore included in this contract.QUESTION:  Final dwg package is supposed to be completed within 4 weeksafter contract award.  How many weeks are scheduled for the draft dwg packageand engineering report?  How many days are scheduled for government reviewfor the draft final drawings and report?  How many days are scheduled torespond to government review comments?  It seems 4 week schedule forcompletion of the final dwg package is really tight.The first milestone has been pushed to 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks.  At theend of six weeks the drawing package, engineering report, and analysis mustbe completed.  The Government has no set time but it is in the Governmentsbest interest to rapidly review and approve the package to allow the contractorto start construction.  It is the Governments intention to work closely withthecontractor within the first 6 weeks so when the final package is submitted itwillnot be the first time the Government has seen all of the contents.****************************************************************Amendment 0004, Effective 16 June 2010Proposal Submission date is changed to 24 June 2010.Contractor Questions and Government Answers:Question: What are the requirements for the design submittal items (number ofdwgs, calculations, basis of design, catalogue cut sheets, and/orspecifications)?Answer: We would expect to see an overall design of the facility, about90-95% complete.  Having all of the fasteners and lower level items yet tobe specified would be acceptable.  All calculations, PE review, and approvalmust be completed on the final design and docking plan.Question:  What is the government review process for the final design?Answer: We will review the complete design and system specifications to ensurethat they meet all of the minimum critical requirements defined in ourconceptual package.Question: Are there any post award kick off meeting and/or partneringmeeting?Answer: There will be a post award kick off meeting immediately after awardand multiple follow-on meetings as deemed necessary.Question: Are any dock lighting, lighting in the bldgs, and/or navigationlights required?Answer: No.Question: Any power receptacles needed in the bldgs and/or the enclosuresAnswer: Only require that the powered roof vents be wired at the vent end andhave conduit installed from the vent end down to a height that is easy to reachwithout a ladder.***************************************************************Amendment 0003, Effective 2 June 2010The purpose of this amendment is revise milestone completion for Milestone 4,Manufacturing of First Delivery of  Sea Lion and Dolphin Enclosures(CLIN 0004).  Milestone 4 should be completed within 8 weeks afterGovernment acceptance of the securing of the sea lion dock and the dolphindock  at the Government site****************************************************************Amendment 0002, Effective 26 May 2010The purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date to 22 June 2010.****************************************************************Amendment 0001, Effective 21 May 2010The purpose of this amendment is a follows:1.  Conceptual Drawings and Critical Requirements Rev1 has been added as anattachment.  Revision 1 includes updated versions of Drawing numbers 088903and 088962.  All other versions remain the same.****************************************************************1.

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p><br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI program in Kyrgyzstan will support the objectives of the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Country Office in Kyrgyzstan (USAID/ Kyrgyzstan), and the USAID Regional Mission to the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) of (1) economic growth, (2) investing in people through health care and education, and (3) governing democratically and justly by strengthening parliament and local governance as well as civil society and media. The goals of the OTI program in Kyrgyzstan are to promote stability, decrease the chances of unrest, and facilitate efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an OTI Deputy Country Representative that will support USAID/OTI's program in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Asia-Middle East (AME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance will be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>

<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>

<p>&bull; Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations (IOs), and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>

<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby cancelled, however, interested parties should go to special notices and look for solicitiation # W81NCL-0134-3001.  The effort will be pursued against the US Army Natick Solider Research, Development and Engineering Command's Broad Agency Announcment 09-11.  Additional information is provided in the special notice.<BR><BR><BR>The purpose of this modification is to correct the point of contact's email address to Mike.Dalessandro@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division in support of the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, has a requirement to acquire integrated short-range, low-bandwidth, wearable communications, sensing, and networking technologies that will enable the analysis, display, and remote monitoring of summary activity, physiologic, and geo-location data from free-roaming dismounted Warfighters in a variety of austere military training settings. These technologies will be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of training, decrease the likelihood of environmentally-induced injuries, and speed evacuation in the event of illness or injury. The envisioned network topology is three-tiered and includes an on-body bi-directional wireless Personal Area Network (PAN) integrated with a Squad Area Network (SAN) that links individual trainees with their instructor/squad leader. The third tier is formed by a repeater backbone capable of relaying data from a SAN to a central Tactical Operations Center (TOC). Bandwidth and message rate requirements are intentionally modest with a desired status update rate under optimal conditions of once per minute per connected Warfighter. No video data or real-time voice will be carried by this network. The overall design must to adhere to a minimalist philosophy of simplicity, robustness, technological transparency to the Government, openness to new third-party sensors and algorithms, and ease of maintenance. Networking technologies desired generally fall into the category of mobile, ad-hoc, delay/disruption-tolerant mesh networks. A fully operational prototype network compromising a minimum of 5 Trainee Nodes, 1 Instructor Node, 1 Repeater Node, and 1 Tactical Operations Center Node that includes user interface and network management software, is desired at the end of the first year. The work effort for year two (Option Year 1), and year three (Option Year 2) will focus on scaling the system to Platoon and Company level applications, respectively. Each node must be capable of hosting Government-furnished health state classification algorithms and of storing both physiologic and network performance data for later analysis. The system and its underlying technologies must ultimately be scalable for simultaneous use by Battalion-sized groups. The communications technologies underlying the SAN and repeater backbone must operate in the 225 380 MHz military band and be capable of generating and receiving signals with 12.5 KHz to 25 KHz occupied bandwidth channels. Because of the potential need for band and frequency agility, and to facilitate future system upgrades, software defined radios are required. Because of their greatly reduced or absent radio-frequency emissions, short-range, inductive-based wireless technologies are required for the PAN. The overall integrated system must be capable of operating in a completely self-contained mode, not relying on any fixed infrastructure. Repeater nodes must be capable of being deployed and retrieved by two person teams. No major subsystem may rely on any proprietary third-party technology. The system must be designed to be set up and operated solely by resident Training Cadre as part of their normal training exercises. The overall design of the system and its sub-components must facilitate future adaptations to changing military operational and research needs and accommodate small-volume applications, while still adhering to the overall minimalist concept of the system as a whole. This procurement will be 100% Small Business Set-Aside and all offerors must meet the definition of Small Business Concern as defined in FAR 19.001. The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee type contract will be awarded. In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office. The Government anticipates the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on or about June 30, 2010. The period of performance for this effort will be for a base period of twelve-months with two one-year option periods. Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Mr. Michael DAlessandro at Mike.Dalessandro@us.army.mil. All questions must be submitted in writing. When released, the solicitation will only be available in electronic medium at US Army RDECOM Natick Contracting Division at https://www3.natick.army.mil

The infrastructure being implemented at ESOC West is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the ESOC East.This establishment of ESOC West is a key component of the Data Center Consolidation program.  ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide the network monitoring appliances required to ensure that users can access their applications across the wide area network.  The devices will be used to monitor network utilization, project capacity requirements, and troubleshoot issues. This acquisition is one of several to establish the ESOC West IT infrastructure. The architecture will be a replica of the IT infrastructure already in production at ESOC East.  It will use the same suite of products in use at ESOC East to ensure compatibility across enclaves and to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer lights-out ESOCs.  41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

This acquisition is to extend the Enterprise Server Operations Center (ESOC) Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to ESOC West.  The infrastructure being implemented at ESOC West is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the ESOC East.This establishment of ESOC West is a key component of the Data Center Consolidation program.  ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide backup servers for the virtual infrastructure to host those production applications.  The servers will serve as backups to the blade servers that function as the primary support of the virtual infrastructure.. 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment #00001<br /><br />The purpose of this Amendment is to provide&nbsp;answers to all questions received during the question/answer period listed herein.&nbsp; All proposals are due by 3:00p.m. Eastern on 7/02/2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />*(See attachment for Answers to Questions posted together)<br /><br /><br />The purpose of this amendment to the solicitation notice is to upload the solicitation and related documents to request proposals by the cut-off date listed herein.<br /><br /><br />Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 0001 to Sources Sought Notice N00178-10-Q-19X1 is to answer the questions submitted during the question and answer period.Question #1 - Is it possible for the Navy to provide the latest Capability Development Document (CDD) for the MRSSMM?Response - No, the Navy will not provide a copy of the CDD.
Question #2 - Is it possible for the Navy to provide both the Surface Warfare Mission Module Interface Control Document (ICD) and the NLOS-LS ICD?Response - No, the Navy will not provide copies of the ICDs. 
Question #3 - With respect to the ICD, can the Navy provide mechanical, electrical, and logic information?Response - No, the Navy will not provide information associated with the current ICD(s).Any system (or concept) provided by an offeror in response to the Sources Sought/RFI should include actual (or notional) mechanical, electrical, and logical information associated with that system.
Question #4 - Is the "key" performance parameters outlined in the Capability Development Document" referring to Table 6-4 of the LCS CDD?  Are the parameters outlined in Table 6-4 of the LCS CDD meant to be allocated solely to the MRSSMM?Response Part A - There is no Table 6-4 in the LCS CDD.Response Part B - The LCS CDD does not allocate the key performance parameters to individual components of the SUW Mission Package.  The KPPs pertain to the SUW MP as an entire system.
Question #5 - Does the MRSSMM require 360 degrees of coverage?Response - Ideally, the MRSSMM should provide 360 degrees of coverage.  However, systems not providing 360 degrees of coverage will be given due consideration, but those systems must specify the limitations or restrictions in coverage.
Question #6 - Can the Weapon/Launcher exceed the dimensions of the standard SUW Mission Module of 4.8m x 4.25m x 2.5m, mainly in height above deck?Response - Yes, the vertical dimension can be exceeded by 1.3m above the coaming.
Question #7 - Is there a not-to-exceed maximum weight requirement for the launcher loaded with weapons? Response - No, there is no specific maximum weight requirement allocated for the launcher fully loaded with weapons.  However, there is a 7500 kg (16,535 lbs) maximum weight requirement for the entire LCS Weapon Zone.  This weight requirement includes the launcher, weapons, and supporting mission module equipment.  As the weight of the weapon and/or launcher increases, the number of weapons that can be accommodated decreases.
Question #8 - Will any portion of the existing NLOS-LS launcher or electronics package be made available for integration of a new weapon? Response - Possibly, existing mission module hardware and/or electronics could be made available to an offeror with a viable solution, but the specifics of any integration activities or efforts will be determined by the government on a case-by-case basis. 
Questions regarding this Sources Sought Synopsis must be received on or before 4 June 2010.  Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability in accordance with the information requested in Information Requested From Vendors section of this Sources Sought.  Vendors that respond to this Sources Sought are expected to provide information including, but not limited to, the technology and missile options they offer for satisfying Navy requirements outlined in this Sources Sought.  All unclassified information should be submitted to Kelley Fitzsimmons by email at Kelley.Fitzsimmons@navy.mil or by fax at (540) 653-7088.

<a href="mailto:MILLER.DEBBIE@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) is conducting market research for information purposes only.  The intent is to identify all potential sources, especially including small business sources with the capacity and technicalcapability necessary to successfully perform the requirement stated herein, and detailed in the draft Statement of Work referenced below.  
The requirement is for "Technical and Outreach Support Services for Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Development and Implementation", which will support the mission of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) within the Climate Change Division (CCD) of the Environmental Protection Agency.  This requirement is partly a continuation of current work under the Climate Change Divisions Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts: EP-W-07-067, EP-W-07-068, EP-W-07-069, EP-W-07-070, EP-W-07-071 and EP-W-07-072; but it is also a new requirement for development and expansion into a new programmatic area.  Congress directed EPA in the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act to develop and implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule for all sectors of the economy.  40 CFR Part 98 was published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2009.  In general, it requires annual reporting of the GHG emissions from certain fossil fuel or industrial gas suppliers or facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year. The rule establishes appropriate thresholds, and methods to be used to calculate emissions for specific subparts.  The rule also includes provisions to ensure the accuracy of emissions data through monitoring, recordkeeping and verification requirements.  Potential offerors will support the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program's mission by providing technical and engineering analyses support, regulatory program and guidance development support, outreach and communications support, data system and information technology support, and finally data analytics and publication support.  

EPA anticipates awarding multiple IDIQ contracts to support this requirement with an estimated total value between $100 Million and $200 Million. Each contract is anticipated to have one (1) 12-month base period, and four (4) 12-month option periods. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this procurement is 541620 -Environmental Consulting Services.   The results of this Request for Information/Sources Sought notice will help EPA determine how it will satisfy this requirement.
All potential offerors are requested to identify and provide a brief description of potential conflicts of interest areas that their firm may have in relation to the source categories listed in Table A., Table B., and Table C. in the Appendix of the draft Statement of Work.  
This is a Request for Information /sources sought notice for written information only.  This notice is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  EPA will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor reimburse the cost incurred by potential offerors who respond to this notice.  The purpose of this notice is to invite all interested parties to submit a brief capability statement, for meeting the requirements in the draft Statement of Work.  The Draft Statement of Work can be found in its entirety at www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/1001731/index.htm
Capability statements must include: (1) Complete Business Name, including DUNs #; (2) Contact Information (address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail); (3) Business Size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA Certified 8(a), HUBZone, etc.).  Capability statements must address technical competencies, and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas in the draft Statement of Work in relation to the source categories outlined in Table A., Table B., and Table C. in the appendix of the attached draft Statement of Work.  

Interested parties should provide a concise capability statement, limiting the response to ten (10) single sided pages.  Capability statements should respond to all items requested in this notice.  This sources sought notice will allow EPA to obtain general information on interested parties and the areas they may be qualified to support as well as areas of potential conflicts of interest.  Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the Statement of Work will not be considered as a sufficient response to this notice.  Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements.  Telephone calls, facsimiles, and/or requests for a solicitation will not be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via e-mail to martin.jeffrey@epa.gov and miller.debbie@epa.gov .  The deadline for submitting capability statements is July 7, 2010, 3:00 PM EST.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) has issued the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Industry Innovation Competition (Industry-IC), see attached file. The Industry-IC invites interested contractors to contribute ideas (within the topics of this BAA) for innovations that increase Veteran access to VA services, reduce or control costs of delivering those services, enhance the performance of VA operations and improve the quality of service that Veterans and their families receive. 
The BAA closing date is September 30, 2010. Proposals can be submitted at any time until September 30, 2010, and will be evaluated as they are received throughout the duration of the BAA.  The Government will be prepared to commence evaluations starting July 6, 2010. Please submit all proposals in accordance with the BAA guidelines to vai2baa@va.gov. 
Proposals can be submitted under one or multiple topics and must be clearly stated so within the proposal. The BAA allows for multiple awards. Each award will have a period of performance of up to twenty-four months. VA intends to maximize use of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts resulting from this BAA; however, offerors may propose alternate contract types providing that the alternative is supported in the proposal.
The Government is not entertaining pre-proposal meetings and/or pre-proposal discussions.  Specific questions may be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer and all questions and responses will be posted here via amendments and at the VAi2 website.  It is not at the Government's discretion to determine if and where innovative ideas fall within the BAA. 
Information from the June 16th Webinar is attached here and at the VAi2 website at www.va.gov/vai2. 
This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this BAA. No contract award(s) will be made unless funds are available.
The point of contact for any questions related to BAA may be addressed to Ms. Lauren Oliver, Contract Specialist, email: Lauren.Oliver@va.gov and Mrs. Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, email: Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

This research effort will be performedunder existing Task Order NNG06HN01D which is indefinite-quantity, indefinite delivery.The goal of this Sub-Task Order is to research the sensitivity of atmospheric ozone,methane, and the atmospheric thermal radiation balance to aircraft exhaust emissions ofnitrogen oxides and water vapor. Northrop Grumman shall complete baseline andperturbation simulations of chemical transport model. Once initial test model runs arevalidated, the contractor shall perform simulations with projected aircraft emissions andassist GSFC as needed in the assessment of the climate impact of these emissions onatmospheric ozone, methane, and thermal radiation balance. For these simulations, thecontractor shall be responsible for 1)generating model simulations with NASA's ModelingAnalysis and Prediction program workflow tool; 2)archiving the workflows as informationabout the data produced for the runs so that others are able to run the same simulationsat a future date; 3)archiving the model results and analyses in an organized and easilyaccessible manner on an appropriate storage media; and 4)generating documentationdescribing the model runs and the location of the model data.  The existing Task Order isa Cost-Plus-Award-Fee arrangement awarded to Northrop Grumman 10/2005. A cost-typecontract provides the flexibility required to accommodate changes in program requirementswhich could potentially be substantial.  CPAF was determined appropriate because thecontract is for the performance of research and development effort, and uncertaintiesinvolved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficientaccuracy to use any type of fixed-price type contract.Point of ContactName:  Lynne Hoppel Title:	Contracting Officer Phone:	301-286-3035 Fax:  301-286-0268 E-mail:  Lynne.C.Hoppel.1@gsfc.nasa.gov &lt;P&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Government-wide Notes NASA-Specific Notes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------You may return to Business Opportunities at: NASA GSFC listed by [Posted Date | Classification Code] NASA Agencywide listed by [Posted Date |Classification Code] &lt;P&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;P&gt;Estimated Noncompetitive Value (including Options)Est.

<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

JUSTIFICATION

In accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.302-1, I submit the following justifications:

1. VISN 23 utilized a Business Software tool entitled â€œAuto Decreaseâ€ for about a 6 year period.  Faults were discovered with this program during a recent audit and action must be taken and completed to review 75,000 records NLT Sep 30, 2010.  Projected performance period is 90 days.  VISN 23 cannot complete the review internally and must pursue a contracted option.  

2. In a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management (10N) Subj: Blanket Purchase Agreements â€“ Revenue Operations - dated: May 6, 2009; the announcement of multiple BPAs were introduced to reduce administrative efforts and allow for quicker turnarounds on orders.  A review of 15 existing Revenue Cycle Activity Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) revealed no contractor offers the required services, nor is the service available via GSA or existing contracts.  The national Contracting Officer Technical Representative has assisted and indicated the work we require is not procurable via existing Revenue Cycle Activity BPAs. 

3. The VISN 23 Business Office is currently utilizing BPAs awarded to Receivia Corp for three different services.  Because this company is currently offering these services, they already have system access, have met security compliance requirements and have obtained background checks, etc.  Attempting to set-up the computer access and meet security requirements with different contractor could take 45-60 days after contract award.  In order to meet the required deadline, these services need to commence NLT June 1, 2010.   

4. To assist in my determination of price reasonableness, I have identified and reviewed the current Blanket Purchase Agreement for billing services between the VA and Receivia, which offers similar services and comparable effort.  The established price is $2.75 per bill. The total estimated value for this BPA is $250K.

5. I have determined there are no alternative solutions that will work for this requirement that would meet our deadline, and be practicable for a 90 day period of performance, and facilitate full and open competition.

6. A notice of this sole source will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site upon receipt of concurrence from the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization.      


APPROVAL


Based on the foregoing findings, I hereby determined, within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1 and in accordance with VAAR 806.304, that it is in the best interest of the Fargo ND VA Medical Center to acquire the required services from Receivia Inc. 

Upon the basis of these justification, I hereby authorize the sole source solicitation for this procurement and by signing this document certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my, the contracting officerâ€™s knowledge and belief.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VAPSHCS. 

2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay kits.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  
The Siemens Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay Kits are used to identify the HCV genotype and subtype data specifically for patient therapy. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:   
Currently, the kit is FDA approved, CE-marked, and meets U.S. NIH treatment recommendations.  In effort to meeting the highest standard of patient care, this specific kit has been determined by the technical expert to be used only on the equipment on station.  In addition, the equipment manufacturer has verified compatibility with the specific kit and no other is known to be compatible.  The contractor is uniquely qualified in being the sole manufacture of the required product.      

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  
It may be possible to identify future authorized distributors, but no information has been located at this time.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:   
Previous awards have been made and verified for the identical requirement.  

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  
No other vendors have been located to provide the identical requirement.

9.  Other Considerations:  
The equipment is not designed to properly process other kits and if the option is considered, it could potentially risk patient care and waste funding originally appropriated for the required kits.
