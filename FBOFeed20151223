<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Distributed Operations (DistrO)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA-AFRL-RIK-2016-0003</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory/Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this Broad Area Announcement (BAA) for research, design, development, test, evaluation, and experimentation of innovative and enabling capabilities that allow operators at forward nodes the ability to conduct state-driven assessment of Air Force operations and distributed adaptive planning, and to perform these capabilities during periods of reduced communications with operational level nodes in accordance with distributed operations concepts.</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking capabilities in the form of software components that autonomously assess the progress of their operations, identify deviations from expected activities and outcomes, and recommend adjustments (re-plan) to enable continuous operations at forward nodes in anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) environments.</p>
<p>The DistrO Program will meet the distributed operations goal by filling technology gaps for dynamic planning, execution, and assessment; and tailor those capabilities for use at the operational level and at the tactical level within a distributed architecture to provide a resilient "<em>push forward</em>" and "<em>push outward</em>" capability to implement the distributed operations concept. For the purpose of this research, offerors may consider elements of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) and Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) as nominal candidates representing operational environments for target technologies.</p>
<p>By developing these capabilities and achieving this goal, AFRL expects an order of magnitude improvement in the duration of maintaining continuity of air, space, and cyber operations at a forward node subject to contested communications; however, the focus of this effort is on the air domain with a desire not to preclude an approach that integrates all three domains. Additionally, efforts under this program are expected to provide the USAF and mission partners with a capability to conduct combat planning with its associated targeting and assessment <em>forward</em> in theater.</p>
<p>The DistrO Program has been organized into two projects, (1) Planning and Assessment Technology Development and (2) Distributed Integration and Experimentation, each with defined focus areas for the FY16 acquisition cycle.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The compartmentalization of the focus areas reflects project funding and thrusts. Offerors are invited to submit white papers for one or more of the focus areas/projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a. Project 1: Planning and Assessment Technology Development:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to advance the state of the art in C2 technologies in order to tightly couple traditionally distinct planning and assessment activities in light-weight software services that can be employed to enable <em>forward</em> entities during times of isolation from the centralized Air Operations Center (AOC). Target software solutions should be compatible with smaller-footprint environments such as those found in the TACS/TAGS.</p>
<p>Research and development must be conducted to assist operators with the planning of Air Force operations, assessment of progress while identifying deviations from expected activities and outcomes, and recommending adjustments (re-plan). Assessment mechanisms will explicitly expose the immediate and projected problems from plan divergence. Adaptive planning mechanisms will be capable of both plan repair (for the current tasking cycle), and plan creation of future tasking cycles. Both the assessment and planning capabilities will operate as distributed replicated services across a federation of representative environments.</p>
<p>The following describes the Project 1, FY 16 Focus Area:</p>
<p><strong>Coupled State-Driven Assessment and Distributed Adaptive Planning:</strong> The Coupled State-Driven Assessment and Distributed Adaptive Planning focus area objective is to research and demonstrate a fundamentally coupled planning and assessment methodology in an environment representing the operational challenges described above. The goal is to providing C2 capabilities at forward entities during times of isolation from the AOC. Current operations utilize centralized planning and assessment activities at the AOC, and distribute orders in the form of the Air Tasking Order (ATO) directing forward entities to perform missions aligned with the Commander's intent. In order to perform C2 activities forward in theater, research and development must be conducted to advance planning and assessment activities which allow these entities to act with the best information available, while meeting the intent of the Commander. This will require reasoning over the various attributes comprising the context of the situation, to include intent, assessments, existing plan, etc. Assuming that communications with higher echelons will be lost, research must be done to identify and document the right artifacts which must be pushed forward prior to loss of communications, to include Commander's Intent, Air Operations Directive, and Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List, to name a few.</p>
<p>The near-term goal of this focus-area is to support the continued operations of forward entities (such as TACS/TAGS) for days beyond the current capability. The spirit of the longer-term research goal involves enabling continued operations through a "Living Plan" capability, where missions are planned far beyond the current time horizon, with plan branches, sequels, and adaptations are continually happening on a rolling basis, based on new world state information and assessments of on-going and future operations.</p>
<p>Providing an assessment of how a campaign is unfolding is extremely difficult, even if all co-located AOC operators have perfect and unambiguous situation awareness. It is even more difficult to conduct accurate and timely assessments at forward nodes within contested environments and uncertain world state. Meeting this challenge requires prepositioning commander's guidance at lower echelons and interfacing with local data sources and those in the cloud which may be accessible to conduct assessments, techniques to improve context formulation, trigger change notifications when plans deviate and recommend re-plan options.</p>
<p>Technologies are required to support the move from the current centralized, military planning paradigm to a distributed planning environment. Enabling continued operations through a "Living Plan" capability at forward nodes is paramount to success in anticipated anti-access/area-denial A2/AD environment. The complexities of this challenge lie in Disrupted, Disconnected, Intermittent and Limited (DDIL) bandwidth connectivity of distributed planning nodes. Distributed planning, assessment, and plan adaptation tasks need to be flexible to support traditional top-down planning paradigms, while enabling the complex synchronization of Air Force activities in a distributed, asynchronous manner during periods of DDIL connectivity. To address this focus area, the development of automated adaptive planning and assessment algorithms, as software services, are required to be capable of recommending new and revised missions based on assessments and world state information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b. Project 2: Distributed Integration and Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>The two objectives of this project are to 1) integrate software components produced in Project 1 into a robust information cloud and 2) conduct tests/experiments to assess system-level efficacy of these combined technologies and determine amount of improvement.</p>
<p>The following describes the Project 2 FY 16 Focus Area:</p>
<p><strong>Integration, Demonstration, Test and Evaluation</strong>: As part of any research and development, the software shall be integrated, tested and evaluated to ensure the software satisfies measure of performance parameters. Offerors are encouraged to utilize concise metrics for measuring performance of proposed technical solutions. Metrics should be identified, tracked, and available for analysis during integrated evaluation and testing events. This research will develop and implement an overarching test and evaluation methodology that assesses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This will also be comprised of developing sample end-user scenarios with varying degrees of simulated communication degradation and data that are mission-focused and relevant to the research and development emphasis of this BAA.</p>
<p>Also see the Supplemental Information Attachment.</p>
<p><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab<br />=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION</strong>:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted, are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab<br />=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6. <strong>GRANT AWARDS ONLY</strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking a contractor to assist with   the provision of case management services through the HUD-VASH program. The program is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the VA Supportive Housing (VASH) program to place and maintain homeless Veterans in permanent, community based housing using HUD Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers that are paired with ongoing VA case management services. Many of these Veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other serious medical conditions. VA intends to engage a Contractor to provide ongoing case management services to HUD/VASH eligible Veterans and their families.
Contractors that are interested in providing these services should be aware that HUD-VASH is a national program serving Veterans and their families throughout the country. This program continues to expand and has become one of the largest VA interventions to assist homeless Veterans. It represents on of VA's most significant efforts to achieve the President's goal of ending homelessness among Veterans. To be eligible for the HUD-VASH program, a Veteran must be:
a.	Eligible for VA health care as determined by the local VA medical center
b.	Determined to be homeless based on McKinney-Vento Act definitions by the local VA medical center HUD-VASH program with every effort made to identify and serve the most chronically homeless and vulnerable Veterans.
The target population for the HUD-VASH case management contract shall include chronically homeless Veterans who are the most vulnerable and may have severe mental health and/or substance abuse problems. Veterans may not be chronic and may fall into one of the priority groups such as women, women Veterans with children, OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, and/or Veterans who have physical health problems and/or Substance Use Disorders (SUD), with frequent emergency room visits, multiple treatment failures, and limited access to other social supports. Through this contract initiative, the VA will place individuals into housing and will then refer Veterans to the contractor for case management and supportive services; who will assist the Veteran in maintaining housing until the Veteran is eligible for discharge.
It is the VA's intention to solicit proposals on a competitive basis for a Firm-Fixed Price contract. Proposed prices shall be all inclusive and will include malpractice insurance, benefits and contractor's fees.  The contract will be awarded as a base year (one year from date of award), with four (4) one-year renewal options that can be exercised at the option of the Government.  This solicitation will be issued as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 15.  NAICS is 624190.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 02/01/2016 with responses due on or about 02/29/2016.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />NHLBI Genomics Portal (GenPort)<br />&nbsp;
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking to create and operate a genomic portal (GenPort). The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-HR-17-05-CS. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking a small business under NAICS code 541712 with the ability to create and operate a web-based genomics portal (GenPort) that will provide HLBS researchers access to genomic and phenotypic data from multiple cohort studies, together with tools for creating synthetic cohorts and performing statistical analyses.</p>
<p>Omics data from well phenotyped human cohorts are an invaluable window into the involvement of particular molecules and pathways in diseases. While much omics data has been made accessible through NIH programs such as dbGaP, most investigators lack the bioinformatic expertise and computational tools that are required to analyze available data. Hence, there is widespread interest in developing tools that will provide non-informatic scientists, as well as informaticians, the opportunity to probe multi-platform, individual-level omics data. Providing wider access to omics data will help to focus basic science and human biomarker research on pathways and systems that are most relevant to human disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the quantity of omics data is increasing at an explosive rate. For example, NHLBI has launched a Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) project that is generating sequence data from approximately 20,000 well-phenotyped individuals in heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) cohorts. The WGS project defines a "high value" collection of cohorts and studies that will be used as the focus of the GenPort program, which will support development of a web-based portal for user-friendly access to and analysis of WGS-generated sequences, together with other omics and phenotypic data from these subjects.</p>
<p>The GenPort program is expected to leverage and be interoperable with NIH's NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.AmaOgKKl.dpbs, which is currently developing tools for integration and analysis of large, multi-dimensional data sets. The GenPort contractor is expected to use general methods and approaches being developed through other efforts such as BD2K and to customize those tools to the data characteristics, scientific questions, and investigator capabilities of HLBS research.</p>
<p>The GenPort resource will incorporate and harmonize data from multiple studies. All software and tools developed for GenPort will be open source, transportable, and freely shared. To the extent practical, GenPort systems will be interoperable with informatics resources developed through the BD2K initiative (http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.In0UiDjR.dpbs). The selected contractor must comply with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy (http://gds.nih.gov/) and adhere to NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?document_name=dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf).</p>
<p>The GenPort contractor must have the capability to develop, operate, and maintain a resource that facilitates investigators' access to and analysis of existing omics, molecular, and phenotypic data from a select group of cohorts of human subjects. In addition to developing and providing information technology systems needed for interfacing with users and for accessing individual level study data, the GenPort contractor will 1) harmonize data elements across studies and identify phenotypes of relevance to HLBS conditions that can be defined across multiple studies, 2) support the creation of synthetic cohorts by external users which may draw subject data from multiple primary studies, 3) provide web-based analytical tools for data visualization and analysis, 4) deliver individual level data to approved recipients for their advanced analyses, and 5) provide educational resources and/or links to educational resources that assist inexperienced users wishing to explore the datasets accessible through GenPort.</p>
<p>The GenPort contractor is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:</p>
<p>1. Create a Database and Catalogue of Studies. Obtain access to phenotype and whole genome data from approximately 10 studies per year related to HLBS conditions, together with permission to re-distribute those data to secondary users as an "NIH Trusted Partner" (http://gds.nih.gov/02dr2.html). Studies must be chosen from among those selected by NHLBI for whole genome sequencing and must include at least one study with phenotypic data related to each of heart, lung, blood, and sleep research. Create a GenPort database including study data, available omics data, and genome-wide genetic variant data for these studies. Develop a tabulation of key information from these studies (e.g., sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria, cohort demographics, data collected, methods, data quality, data use restrictions) needed by investigators to evaluate the value of study data for contemplated secondary analyses. Maintain the confidentiality of the data received, produced, and distributed. Maintain a secure, off-site backup of GenPort data and software. In accordance with HHSAR Clause 352.239-72, Security Requirements For Federal Information Technology Resources, the contractor shall be required to submit an IT-Security Plan.<br />2. Provide Logistical Management of an External Advisory Committee. Nominate members and obtain the advice of an External Advisory Committee which shall provide recommendations to the GenPort contractor on scientific issues relevant to GenPort development and operations. <br />3. Create a Dictionary of Common Data Elements. For each pair of studies selected for inclusion in the GenPort database, identify data elements for which the study designs are sufficiently similar to allow combined analyses of those data elements. Document any differences in study designs that would limit the reliability of combined analyses or could generate systematic errors in those analyses. Incorporate within the GenPort database annotations that indicate the comparability of data elements between studies.<br />4. Curate Harmonized Phenotypes. Define at least 20 discrete or quantitative phenotypes that can be specified using the data elements or combinations of the data elements available in the GenPort database. Incorporate these phenotypes as computed variables in the GenPort database. <br />5. Develop a Tool for Creating Synthetic Cohorts. Develop a data query system that permits users to define synthetic cohorts by selection of individuals from multiple studies in the GenPort database through specification of phenotypes or custom ranges of data values. Users shall be able to specify inclusion and exclusion criteria as Boolean combinations of at least six data elements, computed variables, and/or defined phenotypes. Develop interactive analytical and informatics tools for identifying research subjects meeting specified criteria, for performing basic analyses of subject data within these synthetic cohorts, and for reporting and visualizing the analytical results. Analyses shall include statistical characteristics of single data elements (distribution, mean, standard deviation, etc.), measures of relationship between pairs of data elements within a cohort (e.g., correlation coefficients, scatter plots, etc.), and statistical comparisons of data elements between or among cohorts (e.g., case-control design). <br />6. Develop Tools for Downloading Individual Level Data. Develop or adapt existing software utilities to allow approved users to download selected individual level data elements from synthetic cohorts defined through the GenPort system. Data shall be provided to users in standard formats appropriate to the data content and file size, which may include tab-delimited text, SAS, PLINK, and VCF. For datasets that may be too large for practical storage within the GenPort system (e.g., whole genome sequence data), develop web service application programming interfaces (APIs) for analyzing and/or downloading "big data" (e.g., whole genome sequence data) that are linked to subjects in the GenPort database but are stored remotely (e.g., in enterprise-level cloud data storage).<br />7. Develop or Adapt Tools for Omics Data Visualization and Analysis. Develop or adapt existing software utilities for visualization of and statistical analyses of transcriptomic and genetic data within the GenPort database. Analytical and informatics capabilities shall include data quality assessment and control, preprocessing and scaling, univariate and bivariate statistics, multivariate regression, identification of differentially expressed genes, principle components analysis, unsupervised clustering, allelic association testing, and logistic regression. Visualization capabilities shall include volcano plots, heat maps, and Manhattan plots. Develop interfaces that allow web-based specification of analyses as well as visualization and downloading of results.<br />8. Provide Educational Resources. Develop or link to existing reference materials that are appropriate for self-study by biologically trained scientists and that provide sufficient information to allow individuals without prior experience in omics or genetics research to 1) understand the objectives, approaches, and limitations of omics and genetics research, 2) utilize GenPort to conduct preliminary analyses of existing omic and genetic data, and 3) effectively communicate regarding questions and hypotheses relevant to their own research with experts in omics and informatics.<br />9. Design and Implement Procedures for Registering Users and Processing Data Requests. Develop and implement a web-based process for online registration of external GenPort users, for controlling their access to data and analyses, and for tracking their use of the portal. Downloads of individual level data will be permitted only by individuals who have submitted a specific application through a procedure analogous to that employed for access to data stored in dbGaP (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), and whose application has been approved by the NHLBI.<br />10. Create and Operate a Web-based User Interface. Develop a public website that accepts registration requests from potential users and allows access to all of the GenPort features described in sub-tasks 1-9, above. The website shall provide an intuitive interface that allows users to readily understand the purpose and capabilities of GenPort and to access the resources available through it. Access to features and data that could compromise the confidentiality or privacy of human subjects shall be password-restricted to approved users (see subtask 9, above). The website shall track in a statistical manner user activities, data access by study, data downloads, and analyses performed. The website shall also include a description of GenPort organization and procedures, a link to the NHLBI public web site, GenPort contact information, and a means of collecting feedback from users. The website must acknowledge NHLBI as funding source for the study, provide a link to the NHLBI public website at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/, and be compliant with the standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (see http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm) described in Subparts B 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41. http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm) described in Subparts B 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.<br />11. Advertise the availability of GenPort through efficient media designed to reach heart, lung, blood, and sleep scientists whose research could be enhanced through omics analyses. Prepare and publish reports that describe GenPort datasets, capabilities, processes, and best practices. <br />12. Provide support to GenPort users, which shall include soliciting and responding to queries from individual users regarding GenPort capabilities and analytical tools, study protocols and data, harmonized data elements, and phenotypes. Track the number and nature of queries and the time between query submission and response.<br />13. Provide continuing administration of the GenPort program, which shall include annual ethical review of GenPort procedures, maintenance of access to study data, correction of any flaws in tools and errors in data elements that are recognized, updating of educational materials and links, and logistical management of GenPort committees and boards. <br />14. Solicit, receive, summarize and evaluate feedback from GenPort users regarding user satisfaction with the portal and its operation; validity of curated data, annotations, and phenotypes; accuracy and understandability of educational resources; contribution of GenPort usage to research planning, establishing collaborations, and applying for research funding; and users' research progress and publications enabled by GenPort.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Government anticipates award of one (1) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with cost plus fixed fee task orders for a period of approximately five years with an estimated award date of March, 2017.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps Web page at www.fbo.gov on or about mid to late January, 2016. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. The offeror is responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web page for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.</p>

<CONTACT>Young, Gerold
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase on a sole source basis a membership with the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CaFCP) through Bevilacqua-Knight, Inc (BKI).  The CaFCP is a voluntary public/private organization that provides advancing automotive fuel cell technology to help move the world toward practical and affordable environmental solutions through a unique collaboration of auto manufacturers, energy companies, fuel cell companies, the State of California, and various Federal Agencies. The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b).  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services with a small business size of $15,000,000.00.
	
The CaFCP is focused on advancing automotive fuel cell technology to help move the world toward practical and affordable environmental solutions.  Through the CaFCP, automobile companies, fuel suppliers, government entities, and others can come together to facilitate the demonstration of fuel cell vehicles under real day-to-day driving conditions.  As a member of the CaFCP, the EPA will participate and share in the information and experiences generated through the collaborative activities of its various members. The benefits of membership encompass opportunities to build relationships with all key stakeholders in the fuel cell dialog.

The CaFCP selected BKI based on its unique qualifications in administering vehicle demonstration programs.  Because CaFCP cannot enter into contracts, governmental entities pay their membership dues to BKI, who manages the funds under the direction of the CaFCP Steering Committee and who provides management services to facilitate and coordinate the cooperative efforts of the CaFCP, including operational, financial, contract, and project management services.    

CaFCP/BKI is the only known source able to satisfy this requirement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing membership services with CaFCP may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored. Award estimated date is January 29, 2016.

The USGS requires instrumentation and personnel to collect high-resolution swath bathymetry mapping data for 23 days along the southeast Alaska continental shelf and slope in water depths between 100m and 2000m. The primary purpose of the work is to map and characterize the seafloor expression of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault system to better constrain regional and transoceanic earthquake and tsunami hazards. The project requires continuous, high-quality coverage at approximately 10 m resolution, using a Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System, a POS MV motion referencing unit, and expendable bathythermographs for sound velocity data. (See details below)

The contractor will provide two technicians, lead the mobilization and demobilization, provide and install a transducer pole mount, conduct an accurate patch test and system calibration, and perform all underway data acquisition and real-time QA/QC. All survey equipment will be provided and maintained throughout the survey in operational order by the contractor. 

The planned window of operations is May 1  June 25, 2016 and will take place on a contract vessel. The R/V Medeia (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) has been identified as appropriate and available. We are working towards securing the vessel through a cooperative agreement. A purchase request will be submitted as soon as funding is confirmed. 

Equipment and data Specifications

The final deliverables expected from the survey contractor are the following: 
1.	Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System (minimum source frequency of 40 kHz)
2.	Pole mount for multibeam transducer/receiver compatible with contract vessel to be determined. Pole mount and motion referencing unit should be collocated
3.	POS MV motion referencing unit
4.	Raw, unprocessed multibeam data files
5.	Acoustic backscatter, snippets and water column backscatter data
6.	Motion corrected survey line files in a format compatible with CARIS HIPS and SIPS (i.e., s7k files)
7.	Preliminary gridded mosaic generated during real-time acquisition
8.	Any additional navigation/GPS data files generated during acquisition
9.	The POS-MV data recorded at 100Hz with the POSPac loging group packets selected.
10.	The Sound Velocity data with associated station location, time and/or underway navigation data
11.	Frequent data backup (e.g., twice per day)

For further information, interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer, Stewart Evans at (916) 278-9334 or sevans@usgs.gov.

<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE of a proposed requirement to award a service contract for a Research Protocol Compliance Web-based tool. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and no offers will be accepted. The requirement is for full service access and include set-up and maintenance to a web-based suite for biomedical, clinical, rehabilitation and health services research protocols to support the Minnesota Veterans Administration Health Care System's (MVAHCS). 

This service shall provide tools for electronic protocol file management, on-line document submissions, and electronic tools supporting the management, submission, review and oversight of each research protocol for MVAHCS. The web-based service shall include protocol sharing and collaboration, automatic notifications, research agendas and meeting minute wizard, electronic submissions and reviews, TMS and CITI user training interface, and audit capabilities including electronic revision histories, electronic signatures and event tracking.

The Contractor shall also provide initial and as needed training at no additional cost. 

As a minimum, the Web Based System shall provide following: 

a.	Hosting web interface: 24-hr security patrolled, long-term storage, automated backups, multiple fiber carriers, more than one power grid, FIPS 140.2 compliance and 508 compliance (VA requirements).

b.	Committee membership appointments - add new members and notices when current appointments expire or are ending / renewed.

c.	VA-specific forum for networking with peers who utilize the system.

d.	Unlimited custom letters and forms wizard.

e.	Accessibility: Ability to access system from VA intranet and the internet, as well as use the system and forms with Windows or Mac.

f.	Unlimited submissions to five boards (IRB, IACUC, Research Safety, IBC, Subcommittees and R&D) and conflict of interest program/module.

g.	Program that enables streamlining via a single system, rather than combining paper-based and disparate electronic solutions.  

h.	An adaptable system that can be tailored to fit the procedures in use; ease of customization of forms and processes on the client end, without requiring technical support.

i.	Unlimited users and usage for all registered users, as set forth above.

j.	Online direct completion and submission of forms within the system, rather than having to download forms, complete, save and then upload; this will alleviate compliance issues with document control.

k.	A program that is database driven, not document driven, for greater ease of interoperability, which covers a wide range of options, allowing automation for all programs: IRB, IACUC, as well as SRS only or RDC-only protocols.

l.	User friendly interface as people with varying levels of technological expertise will be using the system.
 
m.	System direct retrieval and tracking of training records from both CITI and TMS.

n.	Allow the VA a "bird's eye" view of the protocols being reviewed by the    
       subcommittees.

<DESC><strong>Department of Homeland Security<br />Immigration and Customs Enforcement<br />Office of Acquisition Management<br />Request for Information<br />Armed Transportation Services<br />Baltimore Area</strong>
<p><br />U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking information regarding vendors capable of providing, operating, and managing the armed transportation and escort of detainees in ICE custody. Services will be primarily, but not limited to, locations within the Baltimore Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR) and in some cases locations in bordering states. Contractor will be evaluated on ability to respond timely to pick-up and drop off times required by ICE. The contractor will abide by all rules and regulations governing Detention/Transportation Officer Performance.</p>
<p>All responses to this synopsis should be sent via email to Pamela W. Odhiambo, the Contract Specialist (CS), at Pamela.odhiambo@ice.dhs.gov , and Bill Fuller, the Contracting Office (CO) at William.Fuller@ice.dhs.gov by January 15, 2016.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice and submissions are for market research purposes only.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a capabilities statement in PDF format [15 pages or less] by the response date.</p>
<p>All business sizes are welcome to respond; however, ICE is specifically trying to determine small business interest and especially Hub-Zone small businesses.<br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS codes should not submit a response to this notice. The applicable NAICS codes that are being considered for this requirement are: 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) develops and maintains the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) which is a part of TOXNET, a group of databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health and toxic releases. HSDB focuses on the toxicology of potentially hazardous chemicals. It is enhanced with information on human exposure, industrial hygiene, emergency handling procedures, environmental fate, regulatory requirements, nanomaterials, and related areas. All data are referenced and derived from a core set of books, government documents, technical reports, selected primary journal literature and other sources. HSDB is peer-reviewed by the Scientific Review Panel (SRP), a committee of experts in the major subject areas within the data bank's scope. HSDB is organized into individual chemical records, contains over 5,800 such records and is accessible free of charge, via TOXNET at: http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE<br /></strong><br />The purpose of this procurement is to acquire professional services to compile and deliver information on the environmental fate and exposure of chemicals and/or substances and related information such as chemical physical properties, production, manufacturing, risk assessment, end use, and overviews of chemicals and substances. This effort requires detailed knowledge of environmental fate and exposure sources and proven experience with environmental fate estimation models, and chemical risk assessment.<br /><br />The Hazardous Substances Data Bank has approximately 150 data fields that are grouped into sections which include specific data. The information and services obtained in this procurement are to populate Section 3 (Chemical and Physical Properties), Section 7 (Environmental Fate and Exposure), and portions of other Sections when that data relates to the information and/or sources used in Sections 3 and 7. All information obtained for these sections are to be entered into the NLM/SIS provided Specialized Information Services Edit/Update System, SSEUS, for review. Section numbers are for sections as labeled in SSEUS, not the public HSDB Table of Contents sections. <br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br /></strong>The contractor will perform the following tasks:<br />1. Identify and compile all data and information necessary to populate Sections 3 and 7. See http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/help/hsdbf.htm for a description of HSDB data fields where section titles are listed in boldface and may be expanded to view subsections. Coordination with the primary HSDB contractor handling toxicology data and other sections will be necessary. This information is required for new and existing HSDB records that need to be updated. Access to SSEUS will be given at time of award for all data delivery.</p>
<p>2. Identify and compile all data and information necessary to populate portions of other fields related to information in Sections 3 and 7 such as, but not limited to, manufacturing, production, use, overviews, and export data in Section 2. Coordination with the primary HSDB contractor will be necessary.</p>
<p>3. Summarize the fate and exposure of chemicals in the environment. In the absence of experimental values, estimate and calculate environmental values.</p>
<p>4. Efficiently retrieve full text articles from environmental databases, extract portions of the articles for HSDB and refer to the articles during peer review meetings while consulting with subject matter experts and the NLM HSDB team.</p>
<p>5. Provide health effects and toxicology information available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) such as Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions (TSCATS) and other government agencies.</p>
<p>6. Provide a Senior Environmental Scientist for attendance at the Scientific Review Panel (SRP) meetings and provide an Information Specialist or Scientist as needed at the SRP meetings to consult with the SRP and the NLM project team regarding environmental fate and exposure data and related information. The SRP and the NLM project team normally meet for 3 days, 3 times a year. This schedule is subject to change.</p>
<p>7. Identify chemicals or substances which may be hazardous to the public and the environment, for which there is a public demand for information, for which there may be a hazardous risk of exposure and/or credible reports, studies or information exists that would support an HSDB record be built or updated. Collect and maintain databases for sorting and prioritizing chemicals for selection to be added or updated in HSDB and provide this information to the NLM project team.</p>
<p>8. Provide chemical and physical properties data for related NLM/SIS databases that link to HSDB such as ChemIDplus. These properties may include: boiling point, melting point, solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient, and other chemical/physical properties as specified by the project officer.</p>
<p>9. Provide information that aids in improving approaches to estimate chemical exposure. This may include identifying routes of exposure, identifying specific use, linking specific products and general use categories.</p>
<p>10. Identify and provide information for alternative chemicals to consider in the interest of safety for specific uses such as information from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safer Choice Program formerly Design for the Environment (DfE) alternatives assessments.</p>
<p>11. Provide data and information for special projects related to the tasks and information described in Tasks 1-10. Meaning, similar activities may be performed outside of the usual record building schedule. This task may be in support of special enhancements to HSDB to improve the current-ness of the data and/or expand content or impact on existing or new user groups.</p>

<DESC>The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified firms, including small business concerns capable of furnishing the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Radar Operation Center (ROC) located in Norman, Oklahoma with repair and maintenance service requirements for the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler Towers (WSR-88D).  This includes tower inspection, engineering evaluation services, structural repair, replacement services, and restoration of galvanic coating services, supplies, materials, and engineering data. The estimated maximum number of towers serviced per year is eight (8). The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 811213 Communication Equipment and Repair with a size standard of $11.0 Million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the System For Award Management (SAM) system.
<p>The NEXRAD program is a tri-agency joint effort of the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Transportation (DOT). The operational user agencies involved are: DOC NOAA NWS; DOD United States Air Force (USAF) and Naval Meteorological and Oceanography Command (NMOC); and, DOT Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NEXRAD program has deployed 158 operational and 3 non-operational (training, test, and repair) towers supporting the WSR-88D weather radar systems throughout the United States with isolated locations and various overseas locations in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Korea, Azores, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) has support management responsibility for these radars for the tri-agency NEXRAD program. Part of the support management responsibility for these radars is the maintenance of the tower structure in a fully operation condition to ensure the mission of the tri-agency radar network can be continuously met.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide for initial WSR-88D tower inspection and engineering evaluations services. Based on the results of these evaluation services, this contract will provide for the WSR-88D tower repair services and WSR-88D tower supplies and materials required for restoration of the inspected tower for a timely restoration to its original conditions. Restoration may include, but is not limited to, replacement of structural components, replacement of fasteners, repair/replacement of lighting protection systems components, corrosion removal, cleaning, painting, and repair/replacement of galvanic coatings and tower foundations. Although the Government does not require the use of OEM parts, the contractor must specify any proposed replacement components that are not OEM parts, and demonstrate to the Government's satisfaction that the substitute part is interchangeable and the same quality of the like OEM part. Finally, the work under this contract provides for the delivery of WSR-88D tower engineering data and engineering change proposals resulting from any modifications to the documented tower configuration.</p>
<p>The Government does not own complete data rights associated with the WSR-88D Tower. The design and engineering data for the WSR-88D Towers are the proprietary property of Valmont-Microflect (CAGE: 29189). The Government does have data rights to the unique as-built drawings for each tower and detailed bills of material for each tower configuration. The Government has available, a set of installation drawings and detailed bills of material to reconstitute any tower height contained within the WSR-88D network for both the Limited Phase Production and Full Scale Production configurations. These drawings contain references to all Valmont- Microflect part numbers and parts/quantities required to install any tower configuration in the NEXRAD network.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</p>
<p>Interested sources must provide the following information:</p>
<p>1)  Contractor's name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS Number, business type and size, i.e., small, large, non-profit, educational, etc.</p>
<p>2)  Documentation to support the contractor's capability to provide WSR-88D tower inspection, repair and replacement including complex logistic support for work on Government site-locations worldwide. No references to websites will be accepted.</p>
<p>3)  A detailed plan explaining the implementation and coordination of resources (i.e. workforce, materials, etc.) to meet tower inspection, repair, and maintenance requirements in the United States as well as isolated and overseas locations. Some tasks are required on a sporadic basis, which means maintenance is accomplished outdoors and exposure to elements. However, a majority of the work is accomplished during the late spring, summer, and early fall.</p>
<p>Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will review each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above. Detailed information must be submitted by email to the address noted below by 5:00 PM, January 11, 2016.  Email Address: mark.caban@noaa.gov. Questions of any nature must be addressed in writing as NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.</p>

<DESC>This base notice was originally posted to FBO on December 9, 2015 10:45 am, but was pulled down and reposted with the same information due to functional issues on the FBO site.  The text included in that original posting is as follows
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) replaces SOL-R7-16-00003. Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. Background The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte). The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data). The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples. About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples. Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual  summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample  data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database. Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project: standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases. Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory. The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD. SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data. The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables. Purpose and Objectives U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software. Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist.

<DESC><br />SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is seeking&nbsp; Sustainability and Energy Analysis consultants or firms&nbsp;for the services described below.&nbsp; A solicitation will be provided to credible&nbsp;firms.<br /><br />This notice is not a Request for Proposal.&nbsp; Interested vendors are requested to register thru the Interested Vendor&nbsp;tab in this posting.&nbsp;
<p>Phase 1 is to meet the EISA 2007, Section 432 includes documentation listing the facilities evaluated, type of evaluation, estimated energy use, square footage, re-commissioning/retro-commissioning measures, and potential life-cycle cost-effective Energy and Water Conservation Measures (ECM). In order to meet the EISA requirement, the evaluation/assessment needs to include covered buildings that consume at least 75% of SLAC's site energy use. The basis shall be the SLAC Consolidated Energy Report (CEDR) Covered Facilities list. Currently this list includes approximately 50 facilities that consist of approximately 1,000,000 gross square feet, a Low Conductivity water (LCW) System, and an Automated Logic Control (ALC) System.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is to complete a Detailed Energy Survey (DES) of the facilities from the Phase 1 evaluation that present potential life-cycle cost-effective ECMs. The DES will include Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Return on Investment (ROI) estimates in order to provide SLAC with a basis for future strategic funding justification and resulting in energy/electric/natural gas/water reduction. The DES will include identifying existing buildings as potential candidates for HPSB conversion in order to meet the DOE HPSB goal by year 2025 and note what needs to be done in order to comply. The DES will specifically address the ECMs that meet the energy and water reduction HPSB requirements. The DES will also note which buildings can implement low cost or no cost ECMs and provide a list of these low cost or no cost ECMs. The DES will be due on 9/30/16.</p>
<p>Both EISA Evaluation and DES Report will have one 90% review by SLAC and one final review by SLAC.</p>
<p>The Consulting Firm shall supply all labor, materials, transportation, tools, and equipment to perform the evaluation and analysis of our site and to produce both reports on or before the required due dates. They will need to have an adequate and knowledgeable staff to handle the requirements and fast track schedule of the above two phases. The staff will need to be knowledgeable and have experience in the required field work, required evaluations and assessments, and in producing the actual EISA Evaluation Report and DES Report as well as in HPSB and Sustainability. The Consulting Firm will also need to comply with the SLAC and DOE requirements (Security, Safety (ES&amp;H), etc.).</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), St. Paul, Minnesota District is seeking interested sources for the Fargo Diversion Inlet Structure project. The work site is in Fargo, ND (Cass County). Our intent is to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in approximately June 2016 for the award of one firm-fixed-price contract.<br />&nbsp;<br />Using USACE supplied plans and specifications, the contractor will accomplish the following summary Scope of Work:</p>
<p>This work is part of the Fargo Moorhead Metro Area Flood Risk Management Project. The work includes, but is not limited to all plant, labor, and materials to construct a gated control structure that will control the amount of water that enters the diversion channel from the upstream staging area. Features include steel piling, mass concrete, three 50-foot wide tainter gates, a parabolic spillway, stilling basin, abutment walls, dam walls to tie the structure to the dam embankments, a vehicle service bridge across the top of the dam walls and across the structure, a mechanical platform and a control building. Mass Concrete involves concrete placed in large dimensions with unique materials and mix designs. The placement requires special considerations to reduce or control the heat of hydration and the resulting temperature rise to avoid damaging the concrete through excessive temperatures and temperature differences. The work also includes approximately one thousand feet of diversion and connecting channel and dam embankments. All work will require the Contractor to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual.</p>
<p>This phase of the Fargo Moorhead Metropolitan Area Flood Risk Management Project is being competed and awarded by USACE and is separate from other phases that are currently being constructed and will be constructed by the non-Federal entities such as the Flood Diversion Board of Authority and the City of Fargo.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990; Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a size standard of $36.5M.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000; the contract will require 100% performance and payment bonds.</p>
<p>Information submitted will be used in determining an acquisition strategy. It is your responsibility to provide adequate detailed information for the Government to determine, without doubt, that your firm is capable of completing a project of this scope and complexity.</p>
<p>In order for your response to this sources sought to be considered, you must provide all of the following:</p>
<p>1) A capability statement expressing your firm's interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel. <br />2) A statement or list of your firm's current or past technical experience similar to or the same as the summary scope of work and construction magnitude for this requirement. Include a brief description of each project scope, schedule, and dollar value. <br />3) A statement or list of your firm's current or past performance similar to or the same as the summary scope of work and construction magnitude. Include a point of contact name, phone number and email address. <br />4) A statement of your firm's bonding capacity. A statement from your surety is not required. <br />5) A statement of your firm's business size and type with regards to the NAICS code listed above. If your firm falls into one of the sub-category small businesses, e.g. HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned, please provide that information as well.<br />6) CAGE Code and DUNS number (for your firm and any potential subcontractors or partners).</p>
<p>Submit this information to Mr. Aragon Liebzeit, Contract Specialist, 180 5th St. E, Suite 700, St. Paul, MN, 55101 or via email to Aragon.N.Liebzeit@usace.army.mil. Your response to this notice must be received, in writing, on or before 4:30 PM (local time) on January 6, 2016.</p>
<p>This sources-sought announcement is used to identify concerns with the capability to accomplish the work. This is not a solicitation. Funding is not currently available for this action. An RFP will not be issued until funding is received.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433- 5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of student admission services at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT).<br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-l(bXl).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611710- Education Support Services. Business size standard for NAICS 339113 is $15M.<br />The proposed source is Education Evaluation Services, 3935 Enon-Xenia Road, Enon, Ohio 45323-9746. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Monday, 28 December 2015, 1:00. P.M. EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Selection of contractor must verify the selectee has an in-depth knowledge of the Air Force's need for advanced education degrees. The contractor must understand how advanced education plays into the career of an Air Force officer and the evolving needs of the Air Force. The contractor must have an extensive working knowledge of the advanced higher education degrees offered at the Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT. Extensive knowledge of and experience with the Air Force Education Review Board, AFERB, selection process, as well as the enterprise-wide Colleague student information system and the OnBase digital document management system are critical to the performance of these responsibilities. Contractor must successfully determine eligibility of applicants for entrance into advanced AFIT degrees, which is crucial. Selectee must know how to determine eligibility for admittance to the programs. This individual must also understand program requirements, education requirements, how quotas are determined by AFPC and the selection process for filling AFIT quotas.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the<br />DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to jeremy.gardner. 9@us.af.mil no later than Monday, 28 December 20 15, I :00. P.M. EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "AFIT Admission Services". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterso n AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only<br />.PDF, .doc, or .xis documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>1.	Background

The ability to store large amounts of energy safely and efficiently is critical to meet the growing power needs of more electric aircraft.  This research activity is needed in order to understand the safety aspects of high electrical energy density storage devices, Lithium (Li) battery technology, and to develop new regulatory requirements to support this technology.  

Recent in-service aircraft have suffered several highly visible battery failures during this development and early service life. These were the largest Li batteries to date, and ran into trouble while in use aboard a small, young fleet of airplanes. Together these led to temporary grounding of the aircraft type, an expensive redesign and repair to restore and retain our expected level of safety, and an extensive toll on resources during the recovery. 

More airplane designs using similar Li battery systems are in certification and in design now. Lessons learned during the investigation include: there has been no usage of reduced-flammable electrolytes in Li batteries, existing standards are difficult to comply with, and such standards need to be applied to all batteries and electrical storage devices for aerospace use. 

The main safety issue with Li battery systems is a failure mode called thermal runaway.  Thermal runaway in a lithium cell occurs when internal heating is greater than the rate at which heat leaves, resulting in the runaway of internal temperature rise. Lithium Ion cells can produce their own oxygen and employ an electrolyte that is highly reactive and flammable making thermal runaway a common occurrence under multiple conditions.  
 
The public and Congress possess an extremely high expectation of the safety of new and novel systems, for which they hold the FAA responsible. To meet the expectations of congress and the flying public the FAA is required to investigate and provide data on new and novel ways to reduce hazards of electrical energy storage devices installed on aircraft.

2.	Purpose
The purpose of this BAA is to study and develop technology, and supporting data for industry standards to reduce the risks associated with the installation, operation, in-service maintenance of Lithium Batteries and other high electrical energy storage devices of all sizes. This BAA is focused on electrical energy storage systems installed and used on aircraft. 

The Energy storage program is investigating the feasibility of new technologies such as less flammable electrolytes, methods to reduce the impact of thermal runway, the need for the development of an aerospace standard for high energy density battery cells. We also would like to investigate technology to implement using COTS battery cells and maintain or increase the current safety and reliability levels.  

Technology developed under this program should maintain or increase the safety of using high electrical energy storage devices on aircraft. This technology should provide faster reaction times, greater diagnostics abilities, and methods to achieve a better understanding of incident precursors as well as repair and maintenance techniques for the hardware necessary for the implementation of high electrical energy storage devices on aircraft.

 Finally the program is studying current guidelines, standards, and regulations related to electrical energy storage devices and develop a set of guidelines to improve, standardize, and system verification and validation.  The program will ultimately include an implementation plan of these guidelines into a standard or specification using any accepted aviation governing bodies such as Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 

This program will explore techniques that focus on improving aircraft reliability, safety, reducing maintenance and unscheduled downtime with the implementation of high electrical energy storage devices.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background: </strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds basic and applied research in the biomedical and health sciences, generating large amounts of new research data every year. As the scope and scale of research data have increased, the standard mechanisms by which data are found and shared (indexes, web portals, journal articles, scientific conferences, direct transmission of data via electronic networks, to name a few) are insufficient. Further, federal policies now require that data generated with federal support be shared, making them broadly accessible, easily computable and readily sharable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">As part of its efforts to resolve this problem, the NIH is developing <em>the Commons<a name="_ftnref1" href="file:///H:/2015%20RFPs/NIH%20Commons/2016%20RFI/Request%20for%20Information%20on%20Second%20Draft%20Specification%20For%20Conformant%20Cloud%20Providers%2020150223.docx#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">[1]</span></strong></span></span></a></em>, a shared, virtual space for sharing data, software, digital learning resources, workflows and other products of research. (see https://datascience.nih.gov/commons). <em>The Commons</em> will help ensure that the digital artifacts of publicly funded research are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). NIH is supporting implementation of <em>the Commons</em> concept via a variety of pilot activities within the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Computational infrastructure for the Commons is initially envisioned as employing cloud computing services. A &ldquo;conformant provider&rdquo; of cloud services for the Commons would offer an array of options, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). A conformant provider is one that meets NIH defined requirements for business relationships, interfaces, capacity, networking and connectivity, information assurance and authentication and authorization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">On Dec 23, 2014, NIH released a Sources Sought Notice<a name="_ftnref2" href="file:///H:/2015%20RFPs/NIH%20Commons/2016%20RFI/Request%20for%20Information%20on%20Second%20Draft%20Specification%20For%20Conformant%20Cloud%20Providers%2020150223.docx#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">[2]</span></span></span></a>, SS-NIHCOMMONS-2015, in FedBizOps, requesting information on an initial set of proposed conformance requirements. Comments were received and the initial requirements revised.&nbsp; NIH now wishes to get community input on these requirements prior to identifying conformant providers and is therefore requesting comments on the revised version of the conformance requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">It is the NIH&rsquo;s intention to finalize these requirements based on industry and scientific feedback during January/Feburary of 2016, and to open a process for providers of cloud compute services to become conformant as soon as practicable after the requirements are finalized. Although all details of the conformance certification process have not been finalized, NIH intends to utilize a reviewed self-certification process during the pilot phase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Information Requested:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The NIH is requesting input in two major areas:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">1.<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The NIH wishes to obtain feedback from potential providers about (a) their ability to meet these conformance requirements, (b) their interest in acting as providers and (c) any requirement deemed by the provider to be sufficiently burdensome that it would prevent the potential provider from participating.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">2.<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The NIH wishes to obtain feedback from potential users of conformant cloud services, that is, from the research community, as to (a) whether services described by the proposed conformance requirements would meet their needs, (b) If additional capabilities are required, what types of capabilities would be necessary to meet general requirements for scientific computing and (c) barriers researchers have experienced in using cloud services to host data sets. NIH is particularly interested in responses from those who already use cloud services to store data and make it widely available</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The draft conformance requirements are posted at: <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/commons/technical_conformance.pdf">https://datascience.nih.gov/commons/technical_conformance.pdf</a>. Please direct comments to <a href="mailto:conformance_requirements@nih.gov">conformance_requirements@nih.gov</a>.

Leasing of Parking Spaces
Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Purchase Order to Lease Parking Spaces

THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT AN RFQ.  NAICS: 812. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Office of Environmental Compliance and Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Interpark Holding Incorporated for (8) covered parking spaces from January 1, 2016  December 31, 2016, with three one-year option periods. 

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Due to the job description of the EPAs criminal agents, they require close and ready access to their government vehicles.  Covered parking is also required due to law enforcement vehicles having expensive law enforcement equipment installed.  Having the vehicles out of sign helps to reduce any breaking and entering which can cause extensive damage to the vehicle as well as the equipment.  As such, all parking lot accommodations for the Criminal Investigation Division must be located within close proximity (2 blocks or closer) of US EPA CID office space.  OCEFT-CID Facility Standards also states: Secure parking spaces are required for government owned or leased law enforcement vehicles.  Access to the parking area is required at all times (24 hours per day).  If parking cannot be provided on-site, it should be located within a two block radius of the office.  Preference will be given to secured, covered on-site parking.

Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPAs requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Sheila Fagan via email to fagan.sheila@epa.gov no later than December 28, 2015 at 10:00 am EST.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of IDIQ Contract HHSP233201500185I to CW Government Travel, Inc., awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) on May 29, 2015. The IDIQ performance end date is May 31, 2017.
<p>The increase is needed to account for the transfer of the&nbsp;&nbsp;United States Marine Corps (USMC) transaction workload that is currently being processed on ARMY-USMC contracts, to this USMC contract.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this procurement is 561510. The DTMO could not have foreseen this transaction change, as it is a direct result of the United States Army, transitioning to an automated reconciliation process that limits the Centrally Billed Accounts (CBA) use to Army only travelers that are entered in the Army Defense Travel System. This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $692,969.20.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for 5 days. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Buffalo, New York has a requirement for maintenance on Better Water, Inc. equipment. These requirements include maintenance and parts for the Reverse Osmosis equipment in Buffalo. The maintenance provider must be able to provide emergency repairs with a one (1) hour response time due to the critical nature of the equipment. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, and because the manufacturers warranty will be voided if an unauthorized representative provides these parts, repairs and technical support, it is the determination of the Contracting Officer that the only reasonable source is Aqua Sciences, Inc.  It is of intent to enter into a sole source procurement with Aqua Science, Inc., this is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely by the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquiries will only be accepted by email at steve.tompkins@va.gov

The published per diem rate for Washington, DC for the time period in which the event takes place shall prevail.</p>
<p>This contract requires lodging for a Period of Performance as stated in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation with stated Option Years. The unit prices for the single occupancy room and/or suites lodging only line items stated in this contract can be re-determined in accordance with this clause, only if a written request of the contractor is received by the Contracting Officer, at least 30 days prior to performance. No other unit prices for rooms or non-lodging line items shall be re-determined.</p>
<p>These single occupancy room and/or suite lodging unit prices can be adjusted to reflect changes in the per diem rates as published by GSA. The unit price for each single occupancy room or suite line items can be adjusted, by the difference between the JTR Per Diem which will be in effect at time of performance and the JTR Per Diem in effect at time of quote.</p>

<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br />Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Addendum)</p>
<p>B. BASIS OF AWARD-EVALUATION</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Award will be made to one (1) quoter deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements, and whose quote, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified in this solicitation, represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable with acceptable past performance.</p>
<p><br />2. Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted. Unreasonably high/unrealistically low, unbalanced, inaccurate or incomplete price quotes may be the grounds for eliminating a quote from competition.</p>
<p>3. The Government will evaluate quoted prices for reasonableness using price analysis techniques. Quoted prices evaluated as unreasonable may be grounds for eliminating a quote from competition. The Government may use one or more price analysis techniques to evaluate price. Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced. Unreasonably high or low quoted prices may be grounds for eliminating a quote from competition either on the basis that the quoter does not understand the requirement or the quoter has made an unreasonable quote.</p>
<p><br />4. Award for All of the Work. The Government intends to award one (1) Firm Fixed Price contract as a result of this solicitation. Quotes received for less than the stated number of items listed in the Schedule may be considered ineligible for award. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one (1) contract without discussions with quoters. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a cost or price, past performance and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>1. The quotes will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors: Technical Acceptability, Past Performance, and Price.<br /><br />Factor 1: Technical Acceptability<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>2. Factor 1: Technical Quote</p>
<p>A technical quote is required from all quoters and shall be provided with the quote. The contents of the technical quote shall be directly aligned with the qualifications enumerated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Quoters shall use the PWS/Technical Quote Alignment Table provided in Appendix A or a similar format that directly aligns technical quotes with the measurable qualifications listed in the PWS.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 -Technical. Technical capability of the product/services quoted to meet the Government's requirement aligned with the measurable qualifications in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. The Technical Acceptability Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below. Note: Failure to meet any one (1) of the specified technical factors will result in the quote being deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Technical Quote Acceptability<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Factor 2 - Past Performance. The Past Performance evaluation will assess the quoter's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance. Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the quoter's recent past performance and focusing on performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Quoters are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the quoter's quote and data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists. Three past performance references for similar services performed within the last three (3) years to either Government and/or private industry contracts are required to be submitted by the quoter. References shall include name(s) of Government agency(s) or commercial firm(s), customer Point of Contact (POC), telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. Past performance areas of evaluation include:</p>
<p>- Business Relations<br />- Quality of Service<br />- Schedule<br />- Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>(a) Each quoter will receive a performance rating of "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" based on the Quoter's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the Contract requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Recency Assessment. An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(c) Relevancy Assessment. To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity. The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature of work, size, and complexity to the services/products being procured under this solicitation. Recent past performance is defined as not more than three (3) years from the RFP release date; relevant in terms of similar nature of work, size and complexity.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(a) Note. In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably, or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote electronically furnished to the successful quoter within the time for <br />acceptance specified in the quote shall result in a binding contract <br />without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified <br />expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a <br />quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a <br />written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><br />4. Factor 3 - Price. Price will not be scored or rated. Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques. Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.</p>
<p>(a) Unbalanced Pricing may be evaluated to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions.</p>
<p>Reasonableness. A price is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.<br />Appendix A<br />PWS/Technical Quote Alignment Table</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<CONTACT>Robert C. Ramba, Purchasing & SM Specialist, Email robert.c.ramba@usps.gov - Jacquelyn P. Lyne, Purchasing & SM Specialist, Email Jacquelyn.P.Lyne@usps.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Buildout project at the Brooklyn Times Plaza CAX located at 594 Dean Street, Brooklyn, NY 11238. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 with construction completion within 210 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of three to five buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as buildout projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON January 5, 2016 at 1pm EST. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov or Wendi Butterfoss, gwenda.b.butterfoss@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on January 11, 2016.</p>
<p>There will be no public opening of offers. All proposal information received is CONFIDENTIAL until award of a contract. Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

Leasing of Parking Spaces
Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Purchase Order to Lease Parking Spaces

THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT AN RFQ.  NAICS: 812. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Office of Environmental Compliance and Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Interpark Holding Incorporated for (8) covered parking spaces from January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2016, with three one-year option periods. 

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Due to the job description of the EPAs criminal agents, they require close and ready access to their government vehicles.  Covered parking is also required due to law enforcement vehicles having expensive law enforcement equipment installed.  Having the vehicles out of sign helps to reduce any breaking and entering which can cause extensive damage to the vehicle as well as the equipment.  As such, all parking lot accommodations for the Criminal Investigation Division must be located within close proximity (2 blocks or closer) of US EPA CID office space.  OCEFT-CID Facility Standards also states: "Secure parking spaces are required for government owned or leased law enforcement vehicles.  Access to the parking area is required at all times (24 hours per day).  If parking cannot be provided on-site, it should be located within a two block radius of the office.  Preference will be given to secured, covered on-site parking."

Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Sheila Fagan via email to fagan.sheila@epa.gov no later than December 28, 2015 at 10:00 am EST.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<p>21-16-446PCZ141</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED, AND THE INTENDED USE:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN ERF has a requirement, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of electronic repair and replacement parts to be used in centralized depot repair of U.S. Coast Guard Electronic Equipment, specifically the Engine Start Electronic Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) that is a part of the 110' Class Cutter Marine Propulsion System. A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: thirty (30) each, Variable Delay Timers, part number 79-201/02; twenty-five (25) each, Variable Delay Timers, part number 79-201/01; both manufactured by Man Diesel Turbo North America, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these parts. The parts requested are exact replacements that make up the Engine Start Electronic Circuit Card that is a part of the 110' Class Marine Propulsion System.</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:</p>
<p>The OEM specifications for these items are proprietary commercial property. The Coast Guard did not purchase this information when Marine Propulsion Control Systems for 110' Class Cutters were originally purchased. Man Diesel &amp; Turbo North America, Inc. originally manufactured the Delay Timers and Flasher Assembly components found in the Engine Start CCA of the 110' Class Marine Propulsion Control System. Adequate item information, documentation, and specifications are not available to develop an appropriate purchase description for full and open competition. Man Diesel is the only known provider meeting system requirements for form, fit, function, configuration, records, and integration with the installed Marine Propulsion Control System, Engine Stop CCA's. Any variances could cause catastrophic damage to the ships' propulsion systems and pose a serious safety risk to ships' crews.</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:</p>
<p>Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using part numbers and item names for a list of manufacturers/vendors that could provide time delay relays and flasher modules; several companies were contacted and no one could meet the OEM specification. The market research showed that only Man Diesel could provide replacement parts that meet the minimum technical specifications to ensure compatibility with existing electronic and mechanical circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p><br />EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The material technical specifications and supplementary data are proprietary to the OEM and cannot be provided to other manufacturers, which eliminates any opportunities for full and open competition. The ships' propulsion control system is critical for safe navigation. Changes in design could lead to malfunction jeopardizing the safety of the ships and crews.</p>
<p>PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The U.S. Agency for International Development, Bureau for Global Health, Office of HIV/AIDS (USAID/GH/OHA) is seeking services for the provision of technical assistance (TA) to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Expenditure Analysis (EA) Initiative's implementation process, improve expenditure data quality, and strengthen the use of expenditure analysis data for program planning and budgeting.<br /><br /> Expenditure Analysis is the routine financial monitoring of the PEPFAR portfolio. The purpose of EA is to better understand the expenses the U.S. Government (USG) incurs to provide a broad range of HIV/AIDS services. It improves the accountability and oversight of PEPFAR's contribution globally by tracking spending and accomplishments over time, as well as supports the strategic planning process with country government counterparts and other key stakeholders.<br /><br />USAID is seeking proposals from qualified Contractors to provide the services as described in Section C of the attached RFP. This is a 100% small business set-aside, under NAICS Code: 541690.<br /><br />In support of the United States President&rsquo;s Emergency Plans for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 3.0, the Efficiency Action Agenda&rsquo;s goal to increase transparency, oversight, and accountability across PEPFAR and its interagency partners, PEPFAR pioneered the use of results-linked financial indicators (expenditures) through its Expenditure Analysis (EA) Initiative, to support financial data for decision making. Use of financial data for decision making has become a cornerstone for PEPFAR. The Implementation of the PEPFAR EA progressed through extensive piloting and phased approaches. <br />Interested Offerors must submit separate technical and cost proposals that comply with the requirements of Section L of this solicitation. USAID plans to award a Cost-plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) term type contract for a performance period as stated in the attached RFP, subject to the availability of funds.</p>

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>A. Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of the quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under FAR 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows:</p>
<p>1. Technical acceptability: Determining Factor: The vendor will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. A vendor's quotation will be deemed acceptable if all the criteria outlined in the Quote Specifics above (per the SOW) are satisfied.</p>
<p>2. Price: Determining Factor - The vendor whose total prices per line item will be added together to arrive at a total price. The vendor whose price is the lowest will be deemed the "lowest price". The vendor must have completed the quote sheet (Attachment III). The Government will evaluate the vendor's quote with competitive quotes received from other companies in the industry.</p>
<p><br />C. AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. This is a competitive solicitation for quotations on a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable basis conducted in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 13. The Government will award from among the technically acceptable quotes based on price and technical acceptance.</p>

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for roadmap and strategy to implement the AMI pilot project.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>The Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company, Inc. ("Grantee" or "CEPALCO") requested a USTDA-funded feasibility study to develop technical specifications and associated implementation plan to complete the AMI pilot project for 2,000 industrial, residential and commercial customers.  The pilot project would determine viability of a scaled implementation of AMI that would be integrated into CEPALCO's smart grid system.  The pilot project would also demonstrate benefits of a AMI roll-out project  and justify CEPALCO's application for capital expenditure approval from the Philippine Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).  CEPALCO anticipates the pilot and AMI roll-out projects would improve power reliability and efficiency, enhance customer services, reduce power interruptions and losses, and optimize the electricity generation and utilization of distribution assets.  Full installations of advanced metering equipment with support communications and control systems for the AMI roll-out project would involve approximately 120,000 customers in CEPALCO's service area.</p>
<p>CEPALCO, the third largest distribution utility in the Philippines, covers franchise area in  the City of Cagayan de Oro and major municapalities in the Province of Misamis Oriental, including a 3,000-hectare industrial estate.  CEPALCO is experiencing  extraordinary growth in electricity sales to serve a total customers of 120,650 with power demand exceeding 142 megawatts via a distribution network of 138 kilovolt (KV), 69 KV, 34.5KV and 13.8 KV facilities.  Since 2010 CEPALCO has invested over $30 million in automation systems, including substation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), feeder automation, and Enterprise Management System (EMS),a dn a Geographic Information System (GIS) that were integrated in its Smart Grid Project Initial Phase.  CEPALCO has approved $1 million to conduct the AMI pilot project.</p>
<p><br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>CEPALCO has requested that USTDA support a feasibility study to conduct the AMI pilot project and a scaled implementation plan that would inform the viability of a full AMI roll-out to achieve full potential benefits of a smart grid system.  The feasibility study will address important technical, regulatory, and financial issues related to improving power quality and service efficiency needed to attain regulatory compliance and approval for capital expenditure investments in power distribution infrastructure.   The preparation work for the AMI pilot project is expected to take eighteen months from awarding of the contract for the pilot project.  The roll-out of meters and the implementation of the pilot project will help CEPALCO comply with the requirements of the Philippine ERC on net metering, pre-paid billing, retail competition open access, and capital investment and enhance its ability to cope with future disruptive technologies and regulatory changes.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $701,287 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

In an effort to promote a clear understanding of this requirement, the Government is soliciting comments and suggestions from potential Offerors. No proposal is required, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this draft solicitation.
<p>Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this DRFP is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration in any U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, an official Request for Proposal will be released at a later date in accordance with FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions, comments, and suggestions on any aspect of the draft solicitation via email to Mr. William Mebane III at william.e.mebane2.civ@mail.mil and Mrs. Keyonna Hogan at keyonna.l.hogan.civ@mail.mil.

<p>Changes, as appropriate, to the Government's requirement will be incorporated into any resultant formal solicitation, which will be posted to the ASFI website.</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Edgewood Contracting Division, APG, MD, APG-EA Branch, in support of the Joint Project Manager, Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance ( JPM NBC CA) is issuing a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP), has a requirement to develop and produce prototype systems for the Chemical Surface Detector (CSD).</p>
<p>The CSD is intended to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System (DWSS), the liquid/ground contamination sampler currently installed on the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV). The CSD will satisfy the Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) 2- Surface Contamination Locator (SCL) objective requirement for the NGCD 2-SLC to be mounted on the Stryker NBCRV. The CSD will provide a near real-time, on-the-move capability to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA), Non-Traditional Agents (NTA), and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC). The detection/identification function will continually interrogate the surface, provide data for processing, and apply algorithms to the data to detect and identify the contaminant which is present. A warning function will display detection/identification information locally and store the information in a format compatible for transmission to external communication systems.</p>
<p>Contract requirements are for the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase - where the contractor provides prototype hardware with Government testing, program, systems engineering and logistics support, and delivery of technical data (end-item products, software, and logistics). Initial prototypes will be Brassboard for laboratory tests. Final prototypes will be capable of integrating on a M998 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and under future efforts the CSD will integrate onto the Stryker NBCRV. The only application for integration on the M998 HMMWV is to test on the move capability. The Government intends to award to three (3) sources; however, the Government reserves the right to award to more or less sources.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAICoE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. The majority of USAICoE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new HTASC.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of USAICoE's WFF/SETA requirements (previously discussed under the Special Notice/RFI for HTASC) will be supported by other contract vehicles (to be announced through separate FBO announcements) allowing the Government to focus HTASC's scope on USAICoE's core mission: Military Intelligence training. Requirements anticipated to be outside of HTASC include:</p>
<p>- USAICoE Chief Information Office (CIO) - G6;<br />- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) - Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0024; and<br />- Knowledge Based Assistance and Advisory Services to include: USAICoE Knowledge Management Office; USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO); USAICoE Safety requirement; and USAICoE Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC).</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Please submit all responses (and any other written correspondence) to the following email inbox (the size limitation is 20MB) with email Subject: "HTASC Sources Sought Notice Response". <br /><br />usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.htasc@mail.mil</p>

Past performance should be recent (meaning contract is ongoing, or, if the contract has ended, the contract end date shall be no more than three years prior to this SSN posting date). Firms can provide verbatim language from the HTASC RFI #1 submission as needed.</p>
<p>Section II. The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc. Describe your firm's perspective on effective strategies for satisfying this requirement, focusing on real-world and/or conceptual solutions and relevant lessons learned that address the Government's HTASC requirements. Please provide any realized or theoretical earned value (e.g. cost, schedule, performance) that may be derived from the strategy/strategies. Describe the basis behind the recommendation and the expected outcomes. Outcomes should be rationalized and articulated in terms of the costs and benefits to the Government.</p>
<p>Section III. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The Government may narrow the HTASC scope to strictly instructors and training development requirements to allow a) industry to focus on USAICoE's core mission, Military Intelligence training, and b) provide more competitive opportunities to industry to support the other training support/professional services USAICoE requirements (to include, but not limited to, advisory/assistance services, USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO) support, Safety requirement support, and Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) support as described in the HTASC RFI #1). What is your firm's perspective regarding this acquisition strategy?</p>
<p>2. Is it your firm's intention to support HTASC as a prime contractor?

<p>3. What would your firm consider an appropriate length of time for transition from the incumbent contract to the HTASC contract?</p>
<p>4. In general, are there specific portions of the Government's DRAFT requirements documentation that your firm feels need to be defined more clearly?</p>
<p>5. Do you feel the requirements are defined enough to allow for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, or, some FFP line items for specific tasks?</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: 16-R-05357.

AMENDMENT A002: Issued December 23, 2015 to extend date for questions to January 6, 2016 and due date for proposals to January 21, 2016.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 21, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, connie.m.houpt@faagov, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, January 21, 2016.  


Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, January 21, 2016, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

Inquiries regarding this SIR/RFO should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

<DESC><p align="left"><strong>Solicitation Notice Information</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation has been charged by the DHHS with developing products for the mitigation and/or treatment of radiation injuries resulting from a nuclear and radiological attack to the stage where products are eligible for advanced product development by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) or acquisition under the Project BioShield Act of 2004.<br /><strong><br />Description</strong></p>
<p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to solicit proposals for contracts entitled "Development of Radiation/Nuclear Medical Countermeasures or Biodosimetry Biomarkers/Devices" to advance the development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCM)&nbsp;or biodosimetry biomarkers/devices to assess and reduce mortality and/or major morbidities associated with exposure to radiation from a radiological or nuclear incident. NIAID anticipates that research and development studies supported by this BAA will advance lead candidate MCM or lead biomarkers/devices toward eventual FDA approval or licensure to assess/mitigate/treat radiation-induced injuries and thereby improve survival following a radiological event. For this Broad Agency Announcement, it is anticipated that candidate MCMs will enter the evaluation and development pathway at various stages, from early research to post marketing (for drugs/devices or biologics that are already licensed or approved for other indications), so the offeror is expected to provide a Statement of Work based on the stage of the candidate and the work that needs to be performed to advance the MCM/biomarker/device. <br /><br />Proposals will be evaluated on the extant, underlying data supporting the amelioration of radiation-induced tissue damage and reduction of mortality and/or major morbidities, and the comprehensiveness, soundness, adequacy and suitability of the proposed scientific approach and methodology used to support the advancement of the candidate MCM/biomarker/devices for the assessment, mitigation or treatment of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) towards FDA approval or licensure under the FDA Animal Rule. The evaluation will also be based on the adequacy of the scientific and technical personnel, facilities, equipment, (GLP, cGMP compliance) and project management. <br /><br />It is anticipated that up to <strong>4</strong> cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a <strong>3-year</strong> period of performance beginning on or about December 1, 2016<em>.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is <strong>$1-2</strong>million per contract award per year. However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed three years.<br /><br />Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. <em>This BAA will be available electronically on/about December 28, 2015 , and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. <br /><br />For this solicitation, NIAID requires proposals to be submitted via two methods: (1) Disc (CD or DVD) and (2) Online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. The content of the disc and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.</em></p>

<DESC>Replace/rebuild second story deck on Swissmont hotel building in Stehekin WA.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The hotel was constructed in 1958 as a single-story structure; a full second level and an upper story deck on the lake-facing (south) side were added in 1968.  The building has gone through various remodels since 1968, with the addition of decks for the lower units in the early 1990s as well as remodeling of the staircase on the south side of the building.  This project includes the demolition and replacement of the second floor deck, including steel pipe and tube railing systems, and construction of a new shed roof over a portion of the west elevation.  There will be an option to construct privacy dividers.  The total (existing and reconstructed) deck is approximately 72 feet long, with six rooms opening onto it.  
Additional details are provided in the attached Statement of Work and drawings.  The contractor will have 75 calendar days to complete the construction after the Notice to Proceed is issued.  Construction must be completed by April 29, 2016.
PROJECT LOCATION:  The Swissmont is in Stehekin, WA, in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Stehekin is a remote community located 50 miles from Chelan, Washington, at the north end of Lake Chelan. The Stehekin Valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system.  Stehekin is accessible from Chelan only by boat, barge, or float airplane.  The Swissmont is approximately 200 feet from the ferry landing, adjacent to a road suitable for hauling heavy equipment.  
Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and, if needed, it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge companies before submitting a quote.  Some tools and materials may be sent on the passenger ferry runs, however restrictions apply.  Please contact the ferry and barge companies for more detailed information.
Lodging and meal services in Stehekin will be limited during the period of performance.   Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/stehekin.htm, www.lodgeatstehekin.com, www.stehekinvalley.com, and www.stehekin.com. 
SITE VISIT: A site visit will be held on January 11, 2016, at 12:30 pm.  Contractors will be required to secure their own transportation to and from Stehekin.  There is regular boat service available from Lake Chelan Boat Company (schedules and rates are at www.ladyofthelake.com).  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged so that prospective quoters gain a good understanding of the logistical challenges of this site.
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 and the small business size standard is $36.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $100,000 and $250,000; however, note that the RFQ is being issued using the Simplified Acquisition methods described in FAR Part 13, which are applicable to actions valued under $150,000.  Payment protection (bond or irrevocable letter of credit) will be required after award.  Prior to the solicitation closing date, all offerors must establish and/or maintain an active registration and complete the online representations and certifications at www.SAM.gov.  
Prospective quoters must visit FBO periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no notifications will be sent.   No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however quoters who have not completed the SAM requirements prior to the RFQ due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  
For more information, contact the Contracting Officer at sarah_welch@nps.gov.  The Contracting Officer's mailing address is North Cascades NPS Complex, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley WA  98284.

<DESC>This Solicitation is hereby CANCELLED. Please see attached.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1. This is an <strong>amended</strong>&nbsp;Solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.303 supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>2. Product proposals are being requested by the United States Naval Air Systems Command as a Request for Proposal to purchase Digital Oscilloscopes in accordance with Calibration Standards Specification <strong>CSS-02-250A</strong> (Attachment 1), including manufacturer's commercial warranty. The Government anticipates that this requirement can be satisfied with commercially available products.</p>
<p>3. This will be a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The minimum quantity to be ordered over the life of the contract is three (3) each; the maximum quantity to be ordered over the life of the contract is three hundred thirty eight (338) each. This maximum quantity consists of up to 316 each Domestic units (CLINs 0001, 0101, 0201, 0301 &amp; 0401) to be shipped to a specified location FOB Destination, plus up to an additional 22 each Foreign Military Sales (FMS) units, for which the shipping address is unspecified at this time but which is to be provided with each Order. Shipping costs for the FMS CLINs (0002, 0102, 0202, 0302 &amp; 0402) will be borne by the Government as FOB Origin. Intent is to issue a Delivery Order for the minimum quantity at the time of IDIQ award. Additional quantities may be ordered from time to time as required by the Government. These subsequent orders will have a minimum quantity of one (1) each and a maximum quantity of seventy five (75) each.</p>
<p>4. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334515. This requirement is being conducted using Full and Open Competition procedures per FAR 6.1.</p>
<p>5. Technical Acceptability and Price are the factors that will be evaluated in order to determine whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Award will be made to the responsible offeror who provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer</span> (as detailed in Paragraphs 6 and 7 below). All responsible sources may submit a proposal for evaluation. The Government anticipates awarding this contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Evaluation</span>: Offeror's technical proposals (product description) will be required to include sufficient information to satisfy evidence of technical acceptability, by meeting the required standards on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, as defined in Attachment 1, the Calibration Standards Specification (CSS 02-250), and Attachment 2, the Technical Evaluation Checklist. This checklist excerpts each of the required characteristics from <strong>CSS 02-250A</strong> that will be evaluated. It provides for rating the acceptability, on a "pass/fail" basis, of each required characteristic of the Digital Oscilloscope, as defined in the Specification document. For each and every criteria evaluated, "Acceptable" is defined as meaning that the proposal demonstrates that the offeror's product clearly meets the minimum requirements of that particular solicited specification (as defined in Attachment 1). "Unacceptable" is defined as meaning that the proposal does not clearly demonstrate that the offeror's product meets the minimum requirements of that particular solicited specification (as defined in Attachment 1). An overall rating of "Technically Acceptable" will require that offeror's proposal receive a rating of "acceptable" in all of the listed characteristics (100%). Technical acceptability will require that the offeror has provided sufficiently detailed information to clearly demonstrate that their proposed product satisfies each specified requirement. The Offeror has the burden of proof to demonstrate compliance with all of the evaluation factors identified in Attachment 2. In presenting material in the proposal, the Offeror is advised that quality of information is more important than quantity. Clarity, brevity, and logical organization should be emphasized during proposal preparation. The Offeror should present enough information to allow the Government to evaluate the offerors product's capability to meet the required specifications. Failure to address a specific evaluation factor clearly will likely render an offer unacceptable. There is no need to repeat information in more than one volume if an overlap exists; the detailed information should be included in the most logical place and summarized and referenced in other areas. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentation materials beyond that which is sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal is neither necessary nor desired. Offerors are encouraged to use the Technical Evaluation Checklist (Attachment 2) to identify where in their technical proposal (product description) each item is addressed.</p>
<p>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price Evaluation</span>: Since this will be an indefinite quantity type contract, "lowest priced offer" shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>Each proposal must include a unit price for each of the five contract years for both Domestic and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements that is stable regardless of the quantity actually ordered. Total proposed price for evaluation purposes to determine the "lowest price offer" will be the sum of each estimated maximum line item (CLIN) quantity times the proposed unit price quote, for all line items (see table below and in attached Solicitation).<br /><br />&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;D<br />CLIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QTY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNIT PRICE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TOTAL EVALUATED PRICE<br /><br />0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0201&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0202&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0302&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0401&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br />0402&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor Quote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B times Column C<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 338 ea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sum of Column D for all ten CLINS = Evaluated Price</p>
<p>NOTE: There is no guarantee that the above quantities will be ordered. These quantities are for proposal price evaluation purposes. The minimum quantity that will be ordered over the life of the contract is three (3); the maximum quantity that will be ordered is three hundred thirty eight (338) each. The minimum quantity pre order is one (1) each); the maximum quantity per Order is seventy five (75) each. No stepladder pricing.</p>
<p>8. The Contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of the standard manufacturer's commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale for at least one year. Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government's right under the inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of the resulting contract. In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty. The warranty period shall begin upon acceptance by the Government of the delivered product.<br /><br />9. All items shall be preserved, packaged, and marked in accordance with best commercial practices. Items shall be delivered to the Government no later than ninety (90) days after award of each specific delivery order, though earlier delivery at no additional charge to the Government is acceptable and encouraged. FOB is Destination for Domestic CLINs, and Origin (Shipping Point) for FMS CLINs. Inspection and acceptance will be at Destination for Domestic CLINs and at Origin (by DCMA) for FMS CLINs.</p>
<p>10. In accordance with FAR 19.702, all offerors that are other than a Small Business are required to submit with their proposals either evidence to support a determination that no subcontracting opportunities exist, or a Small Business Subcontracting Plan, which must be evaluated and approved by the Small Business Administration prior to receiving a contract award.</p>
<p>11. In accordance with DFARS 252.211-7003, all products with a unit price above $5,000 are required to be marked according to the criteria in MIL-STD-130, Identification Marking of US Military Property.</p>
<p>12. The offeror shall provide Representations and Certifications prescribed in FAR 52.212-3 Alt I Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items with their quote, or electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM).</p>

<DESC>This notice amendment was originally posted to FBO on December 18, 2015 11:43 am, but was pulled down and reposted with the same information due to functional issues on the FBO site.  The text included in that original posting is as follows:<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) replaces SOL-R7-16-00003. Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. Background The STC currently has a locallydeveloped Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte). The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data). The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples. About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples. Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database. Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project: standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases. Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory. The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD. SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data. The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables. Purpose and Objectives U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software. Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist. Region 7 manages sample receipt and analysis for two in-house laboratories and two external (contracted) environmental laboratories. Period of Performance: Unknown at this time Scenarios 1. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for for full replacement of the database and the front-end forms. 2. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the updated Oracle database. 3. In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database). All solutions need to be able to migrate historical data from the current Oracle database into the new solution, migrate analytical data from the analytical instruments into the new system, and provide a similar range of forms and reports. Deliverables include the following: 1. Company Name and DUNS 2. Company point of contact name, email address and telephone number. 3. Demonstration of capability 4. Socioeconomic category 5. Experience working with environmental laboratories 6. Explain how the system would work in the laboratory setting 7. Explain who would perform minor and major changes Please do not include any cost information at this time. Your company may provide information on as many Scenarios, as applicable to your qualifications (even if it is just for one Scenario). Be sure to reference each specific Scenario your information is referring to. For more details on this requirement, please go to: www.fedconnect.net All questions shall be sent through Fedconnect only. All information pertaining to this RFI shall be submitted through Fedconnect only. Questions/information received by other means than Fedconnect will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted, no later than December 31, 2015. All information must be submitted through Fedconnect, no later than January 7, 2016 at 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>This notice amendment was originally posted to FBO on December 21, 2015 3:53 pm, but was pulled down and reposted with the same information due to functional issues on the FBO site.  The text included in that original posting is as follows:<br /><br />Amendment 1 &amp; 2: Answers Contractor questions.
<p>1. Q: Are there requirements for managing unstructured (Big) data? A: No.</p>
<p>2. Q: Are there any specific high availability requirements? (e.g., system must maintain 99.999% availability through the year, require automatic failover between nodes, must replicate all data, binaries, configurations to a remote site for disaster recovery). A: No.</p>
<p>3. Q: Is the data from the instruments transferred to the database in real-time data streams? (vs manual load, batch process, etc.). A: No.</p>
<p>4. Q: I'm inquiring about the Front-end capabilities requested in this RFI. The Oracle database application does have a generic UI interface associated with it. My assumption is that EPA region 7 might not be satisfied with this or is seeking specific capabilities/functionalities associated with an updated front-end user interface. Is this accurate? If so, can you provide some guidance about what type of capability or functionality EPA is expecting from the front-end UI? I feel the RFI does not address this. It would be great to speak with the end user to really get a sense of what they'd like to have in an updated Front-end user interface.<br />A: No User Interface requirements have been included in this RFI.</p>
<p>5. Q: The RFI states: The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. What technology was used to develop this application? Oracle Forms and Reports? Application Express? Other? A: Primarily Oracle Forms and Reports version 6. Some third party add-ins used to handle PDF generation, email, and MS Office integration. Extensive use of Oracle stored procedures and/or database triggers.</p>
<p>6. Q: The RFI states: About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Do you already have 200 forms and reports or do you need 200 forms and reports developed as the front-end of this system? A: We already have 200 forms and reports in production, but assume that none of them will be usable in the new system.</p>
<p>7. Q: The RFI states: In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database). A: Ok.</p>
<p>8. Q: Does STC currently use Promium solutions? If so, what is the back-end Promium database (for example: Oracle, MS SQL, Access, proprietary, etc)? A: No, the STC does not currently use Promium solutions.</p>
<p>9. Q: Can you give examples of the functionality of a front-end solution? A: Yes, but have been instructed not to provide this information as part of the RFI process.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0002 -&nbsp;24 Dec 2015<br /><br />Synopsis:
<p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 111 OF THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATION ACT, 2015 (DIVISION I OF PUB. L. NO. 113-235) AND SIMILAR SECTIONS IN SUBSEQUENT MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACTS, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS OPEN ONLY TO UNITED STATES FIRMS OR TO JOINT VENTURES OF UNITED STATES AND HOST NATION (JAPAN) FIRMS</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION / CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (A-E) Act as implemented by FAR Part 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for multiple Indefinite-Delivery Contracts (IDCs) to support the US DoD construction program in Japan. The acquisition will have a total aggregate capacity of $90 Million (M) shared amongst all awardees. A target of five (5) to ten (10) individual IDCs will be negotiated and awarded. Contracts will be awarded to the most highly qualified firms. The period of performance for each A-E IDC will consist of a one-year base period and four (4) consecutive one-year option periods. Services will be obtained under the multiple A-E IDCs through negotiated firm-fixed price task orders, having a magnitude of $2.5K to $7.5M. TO selections will be determined based on a firm's qualifications for a specific project. Updates to SF330s will be required annually in accordance with FAR 36.603(d). In the event the firm is a JV, the offer must be accompanied by the original copy of the Joint Resolution of the Boards of Directors of the firms composing the JV. To be eligible for contract award, United States firms or United States JV firms that partner with a host nation (Japanese) firm must be registered in the U.S. Government System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM Internet site at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. The Government can issue a Letter of Identification to the employees of the successful firm upon their request after contract award, which entitles individual employees of the A-E firm to enter Japan to perform work on task orders issued under the contract under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and Japan, Article 1(b). This invited status is only granted to individual employees; no status will be granted to the A-E firm as a whole under SOFA Article XIV.</p>

Criteria f is considered secondary and will only be used as a "tie-breaker" among highly qualified firms that are essentially considered technically equal. For purposes of evaluating selection criteria, the use of the term "firm" means the entity/entities listed on the SF330, Part I, Section C (proposed team) identified as a prime, JV partner, or subcontractor. For the purposes of awarding a contract, a firm that is a JV must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) as a JV.</p>
<p>a. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE. The Government will evaluate specialized experience and technical competence based on the information presented in the Architect-Engineer Qualifications - Standard Form 330 (SF330). A maximum of ten (10) example projects may be submitted for consideration under SF330, Part I, Section F. A minimum of one (1) example project must be submitted in order to be evaluated for this primary selection criteria. Example projects should be for design efforts completed within six (6) years of NOP closing. Incomplete projects (less than 100% contract complete will not be evaluated. For purposes of evaluating selection criteria, the use of the term "project" means a single undertaking executed via a single-award contract or task order. A "project" is not considered a cumulative effort of single-award contracts or task orders. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) / Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is not considered a project on its own, but a task order awarded under an IDC or IDIQ would be considered to be a single "project". Additional information demonstrating a firm's qualifications may be presented in other sections of the SF330 as appropriate</p>
<p>(1) Past experience in accomplishing comprehensive design efforts as the Designer of Record (DOR) for Design-Bid-Build or Design-Build projects and criteria development in support of US DoD Construction Programs in Japan, as described in section 2 of this synopsis. All facility types physically located within installations and / or supporting military installations will be considered relevant. Projects of greater scope complexity and requiring participation of multiple disciplines, including subcontractors, will be evaluated more favorably. For example, past experience in the complete designing of a 500 MW electric power plant at Camp Zama, Japan will be evaluated more favorably than past experience in designing a 500 square foot concrete equipment pad at the same location. Demonstration of prior working relationships between the prime and subcontractors, with direct involvement of the prime on past projects, will be evaluated more favorably. Example Projects that have been completed by multiple entities within the same firm (e.g., by both members of a joint venture, a subcontractor, and/or a prime contractor), should identify the approximate amount of work (as a percentage of the total value) contributed by each entity of the firm in regards to the total effort. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and supplemental information provided in Section G and H. <br /><br />(2) Experience and knowledge of Japanese construction criteria, methods, materials, and standards. Demonstrate the ability to incorporate this experience and knowledge to meet the intent of US DoD construction criteria while facilitating and maximizing the use of local materials and construction methods. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to incorporate these elements into the overall design process for projects contemplated under this acquisition action. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and information provided in Section H. <br /><br />(3) Experience in developing construction cost estimates for US DoD projects in Japan. Demonstrate the capability to develop accurate construction cost estimates for US DoD projects in Japan based on the ability to articulate the basis of cost estimates through written narratives that justify cost data sources and rates, assumptions, assumed methodology, indirect costs, and other cost implicating factors. Indicate experience with pricing/estimating in foreign and changing markets, as well as ability to obtain cost data and using this information effectively within MCACES/Mii. Firms may include historical data comparing awarded contract amounts to cost estimates developed during design to demonstrate cost estimating accuracy. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(4) Experience in sustainable design and development (SDD) practices, including experience implementing federal mandates (including but not limited to EPAct 2005, EISA 2007, E.O. 13423, E.O. 13514, and the Federal High Performance and Sustainable Building Guiding Principles), Department of Defense SDD policies and regulations, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) documentation, and LEED certification procedures. Clearly identify the role of the firm, and whether each project has been registered with US Green Building Counsel (USGBC) or certified by Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). Provide a maximum of ten (10) recent (completed within the past 6 years) projects that achieved LEED Silver or higher certification. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and supplemental information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(5) Experience in the total building commissioning process, serving as the Commissioning Authority (CxA) responsible for acquiring all necessary Government systems information, providing technical guidance to develop design, construction, and commissioning documents, and commissioning the various project systems. Additional clarification regarding the CxA process, procedures and responsibilities are presented in USACE Engineering and Construction Bulletin No. 2015-6. Demonstrate CxA oversight work experience on a maximum of five (5) recent (completed with the past 6 years) projects. Project information may be presented under SF330 Section H and is not required to be presented as a separate example project under SF330 Section F. Provide a narrative description of the firm's CxA roles and responsibilities for each project cited. <br /><br />(6) Ability to prepare design drawings in 2D and using Building Information Modeling (BIM) with the latest versions of software from Autodesk and Bentley Systems. Example projects should state if BIM was employed in the preparation of drawings. Firms shall provide a short narrative addressing the firm's adoption of BIM, including when the firm first began using BIM on a regular basis, and what it perceives to be the benefits of BIM. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and brief historical information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(7) Quality Management. Firms will be evaluated on their approach to ensure technical quality and accuracy of work products as prescribed in USACE ER 1110-1-12 Quality Management. A firm's approach to resolve issues of quality will be analyzed to determine their ability to provide quality design products. Describe and define the processes of the firm's quality control plan and list, by name and position, all key personnel responsible for its execution. Quality control information shall address and identify the key relationship between safety and quality, particularly in respect to tasks which require site work and site investigations. Information describing Quality Management may be presented in SF330, Part I, Section H. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will be required prior to contract award from firms who are selected under this NOP.</p>
<p>b. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. Provide a minimum of one (1) individual / up to a maximum of two (2) individuals per discipline for each of the key personnel disciplines identified below, (1) through (19). Firms will not be evaluated more favorably for identifying additional Key Personnel beyond the minimum identified above. Identified key personnel will be more highly evaluated if he or she demonstrates longevity with the firm, and if he or she participated in the firm's sample projects submitted in the SF 330 Section F. Use a separate Section E for each individual. Do not generalize professional registrations or certifications but provide specific details. The lead architect or engineer in each discipline must be registered in the appropriate professional field. For purposes of selection criteria, the use of the term "registered" means a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer registered to practice in the particular discipline in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States. Accepted Japanese equivalent "registered" personnel are listed below. The Government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. This criterion primarily focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the "capacity to accomplish the work" criterion. The Designer of Record in each discipline must be registered in the United States, but does not have to be registered in a particular US state or territory.</p>
<p>Firms shall provide key personnel for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>(1) PROJECT MANAGERS (U.S. Registered Architect or Engineer)<br />(2) U.S. REGISTERED ARCHITECTS<br />(3) U.S. REGISTERED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS<br />(4) U.S. REGISTERED MECHANICAL ENGINEERS <br />(5) U.S. REGISTERED CIVIL ENGINEERS<br />(6) U.S. REGISTERED GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS<br />(7) U.S. REGISTERED STUCTURAL ENGINEERS<br />(8) U.S. REGISTERED FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEERS<br />(9) COST ENGINEER (Qualified means a degree in Engineering or Architecture with at least ten (10) years cost estimating experience and be a Certified Cost Consultant (CCC) or Certified Cost Professional (CCP) as certified by the AACE.

<p>c. PAST PERFORMANCE. Firms will be evaluated on past performance for quality of work products, compliance to project schedules, and effectiveness of management. Past performance data for example projects presented under Part I, Section F of the SF330 will be considered. Past performance evaluations will be retrieved through the Government's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and managed through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). PPIRS is the primary source of information on past performance. Performance evaluations will be queried for all firms. Any credible, documented information on past performance may be considered, but the Government is not required to seek other information on past performance if none is available through PPIRS. Complete evaluations will be reviewed if a board is considering downgrading or eliminating a firm due to adverse past performance evaluations. (Note: Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) can be used to provide or supplement a firms past performance with other than U.S. Governmental clients. Firms which choose to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to the below referenced POC via email.). NOTE: if no relevant past performance information is available to evaluate, or if the record is so sparse that no meaningful rating can be reasonably assigned the offeror will be assigned a rating of neutral and shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>d. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK. The Government will consider a firm's experience with similar size projects and its available capacity to perform multiple simultaneous task orders while completing the work within the schedule required by the Government. Demonstrate the firm's capacity to perform up to three (3) task orders concurrently, at separate locations within Japan, not within the same prefecture. Firms will be evaluated on their capability to perform the assigned work based on the number of employees, specified in a list addressing each discipline identified under criterion b; and on the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts that a firm has been awarded. List the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts for each entity of the firm in SF330, Part I, Section H. The basis of this evaluation for this criterion will focus on the information identified in SF330, Part I, Section H and Part II General Qualifications. To receive a rating of Satisfactory for this criteria, the firm must demonstrate availability of the following number of employees, given the full potential value of any current IDCs that the firm currently has been awarded:</p>
<p>Based on total potential value of current IDCs (less than $10M/$10M-$25M/$25M and above)<br />Project Managers - 5/10/15<br />Architects - 5/10/15<br />Landscape Architects - 2/5/7 <br />Interior Designer - 2/5/7 <br />Electrical Engineers/Communication Distribution Designers - 5/10/15 <br />Mechanical Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Civil Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Geotechnical Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Structural Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Fire Protection Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Environmental Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Surveyors - 2/5/7 <br />CADD Operators - 10/15/20 <br />LEED Accredited Professional (AP) - 1/2/3 <br />Commissioning Authority (CxA) - 1/2/3 <br />Cost Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Certified Value Specialists - 1/2/3 <br />Facilitators - 1/2/3</p>

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.</p>

The current Labor Hour Task Order expires December 30, 2015 and has a current ceiling price of $10,925,945.78.
