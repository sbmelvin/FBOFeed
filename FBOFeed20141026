The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. <br>  <br> (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br>  <br> (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br>  <br> (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br>  <br> (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br>  <br> The Contractor represents that it ( x ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541611- assigned to contract number      . <br>  <br> (Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title). <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)  <br>  <br> This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor point of contact identified in the incident report at (d)(1) of this clause provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this clause. The Contractor shall comply with damage assessment information requests. The requirement to share files and images exists unless there are legal restrictions that limit a company's ability to share digital media. The Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer of the source, nature, and prescription of such limitations and the authority responsible. <br>  <br> 	(e)  Protection of reported information. Except to the extent that such information is lawfully publicly available without restrictions, the Government will protect information reported or otherwise provided to DoD under this clause in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.

Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal  <br> Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to  <br> ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor. <br>      <br> (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow. <br>     Solicitation: <br>  <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>             Item No.                  Supplies/Service        Quantity        Unit      Unit price      Amount <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> 0001............................
