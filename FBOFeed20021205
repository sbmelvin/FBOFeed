<ARCHDATE>12052003
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms= .gov;
<DESC>This announcement (0103RP70926) solicits White Papers, of not more th= an five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals=  Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program= , Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER), relative to assessing=  the effects of Hurricane Lili on offshore operations.    BACKGROUND: Promp= ted by the damages caused by Hurricane Lili on Gulf of Mexico OCS facilitie= s, MMS is interested in receiving White Papers for research proposals relat= ive to certain subject areas for structural assessment, reliability analysi= s of safety devices, and performance of selected offshore facilities. Propo= sals will be funded under the direction of the Technology Assessment and Re= search Program, and only efforts relevant to the technical/engineering task= s listed below will be considered.  A White Paper should only address one s= pecific task; however, an Offeror may submit one or more White Papers to co= ver additional tasks. The MMS anticipates a total budget of $800,000 for th= ese tasks and a level of effort of between one-quarter and two person years=  for each project; Offerors should keep this in mind when responding to thi= s request of interest. All or part of the following tasks may be funded dep= ending on the interest and scope of the White Papers received and total fun= ds available. Priority consideration will be given to proposals to be condu= cted as Joint Industry Projects.  OBJECTIVES: 1) Hindcast Study for Wave, C= urrent and Winds Fields for Hurricane Lili. The objective of this task is t= o develop a model to determine a reliable estimate of waves, currents and w= inds occurring at specific locations during Hurricane Lili. The information=  will be used to determine forcing functions for the assessment of damage a= s well as the performance of deep and shallow water offshore facilities as = a result of Hurricane Lili. 2) Assessment of the Performance of Offshore Sa= fety and Pollution Control Devices in the Aftermath of Hurricane Lili. The = objective of this task is to correlate damage to risers, conductors, pipeli= nes and other units which have specifically installed equipment such as dow= nhole safety devices for wells and emergency shutdown systems for pipelines= .  The study shall provide an assessment of the reliability of the safety d= evices during a major event to perform as intended. 3) Post Mortem Failure = Evaluation Study for Fixed Steel Jacket Platforms. The objective of this ta= sk is to conduct a post mortem analysis of several fixed platforms exposed = to or damaged by Hurricane Lili to determine why some failed and others sur= vived. The information developed should be compared to results obtained fro= m similar studies as a result of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and should addres= s current API guidelines with recommendations for any design changes and/or=  mitigation strategies. 4) Post Mortem Failure Study for Single and Multi W= ell Caisson Facilities. The objective of this task is to conduct a post mor= tem assessment of damaged or failed caisson facilities. The results obtaine= d should be compared with similar studies conducted after Hurricane Andrew = noting similarities in failures, adequacy of current design guidance and re= commendations relative to future guideline changes or mitigation strategies= . 5) Assessment of Drilling Rig Failures During Hurricane Lili. The objecti= ve of this task is to gather and review information available from the loss=  of station keeping of a MODU and the failures associated with two jack-up = rigs. The study should address failure scenarios and any similarities in th= e failures, with recommendations for possible mitigation measures. 6) Asses= sment of the Performance of Subsea Completion Systems. The intent of this t= ask is to assess the performance and reliability of subsea trees, both hori= zontal and vertical, as well as mud line hangers, umbilicals, valves, chemi= cal injection systems, and direct hydraulic and electro-hydraulic control s= ystems. The study should evaluate subsea completion systems performance ove= r the last 10 years and assess the oceanographic impacts on the three subse= a completion systems that were damaged as a result of Hurricane Lili, notin= g future mitigation strategies. 7) Evaluate Hurricane Induced Damage to Off= shore Pipelines. The objective of this task is to investigate pipeline fail= ures as a result of Hurricane Lili to include flow lines, major trunk lines=  and platform risers for both fixed and floating production facilities. The=  results of the investigation should be compared with studies conducted as = a result of Hurricane Andrew and make recommendations for possible changes = in design or operations guidelines which might prevent future failures or p= ollution. 8) Assessment of the Performance of Deepwater Floating Production=  Facilities. The objective of this study is to collect and assess informati= on on the performance of deepwater production facilities that were impacted=  by Hurricane Lili. The study should address the total performance of the s= ystem to include risers and moorings, assess any occurred damage or potenti= al impacts associated with the hurricane to include noted vortex induced fa= tigue, waves in decks and facility motions.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: As a = result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated=  for funding. Efforts to be considered should be specifically related to th= e above stated issues. Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.  HOW T= O RESPOND:  White Papers, not more than five (5) pages in length, an origin= al plus five (5) copies and one (1) electronic copy to be submitted concurr= ently in pdf or Word format on CD or standard 3 =BD inch diskette shall be = submitted to RICHARD P, BOLICK, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS M= ANAGEMENT SERVICE, 381 ELDEN STREET, HERNDON, VIRGINIA 20170-4817, not late= r 4:00 PM, EST January 3, 2003.

<DESC>NA This is Sealed Bid (IFB), full & open competition. The overall project is divided into two (2) construction phases.  Phase 1 was constructed earlier in 2002.  This solicitation and the work requirements described herein are for construction Phase 2 only.  Phase 2 general work description follows:  Stabilize approximately 1,300 linear feet of the left bank of the Kansas River for the protection of the Kansas River bridge along FAS route 209 (Leavenworth County Road 1).  Construct stone-fill dike and revetme nt stabilization features using approximately 22,500 tons of stone.  Associated work includes some limited clearing, the construction of roughly 1,500 linear ft. of access route, and the grading, excavation and fill needed to prepare river banks for stone placement.  Tree planting and revegetation work is also anticipated.  Much of the work will be accomplished in the Kansas River channel during expected winter low-water period.  Successful Phase 2 construction will require the capability to rapidly place ( avg. 4,500 tons/week) the stonefill using bankside staging and operations that will extend into the river channel as dike and revetment features are built out.  Barge placement is not practical for most work due to typically shallow river levels.  The NAIC S Code is 23499, the SIC Code is 1629.

The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 

Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov/, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.**************************************************

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA, intends to issue a contract to The Boeing Company, Saint Louis, MO on an other than full and open competition basis in support of the High Speed Anti-Radiation Demonstration (HSAD) Project.  To support the HSAD demonstration, the Boeing Company will conduct loads and separation wind tunnel testing and analysis on the F/A-18 aircraft.  As the prime contractor for the Navy's F/A-18 aircraft from which the HSAD vehicle will be launched, they have the in-depth knowledge of the F/A-18's unique flow field and structural characteristics that is required to evaluate the safety of carrying and launching the HSAD from an F/A-18.  The effort will include technology support, data reduction, documentation and reporting of analysis results.  To ensure compatibility with Boeing's F/A-18 6% scale model aircraft the government requires Boeing to provide a 6% scale model of the HSAD air vehicle that will meet the wind tunnel facility's requirements for separation issues associated with the wind tunnel testing.  The HSAD Project is directed toward increasing the range and average velocity of an advanced version of the High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) system.  To meet the increased range and average velocity, the HSAD air vehicle will incorporate an integral rocket, variable flow ducted rocked ramjet and a tail controlled steering concept.  The HSAD project is administrated by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Time Critical Strike (TSC) element.  The government contemplates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Services type of contract for this effort.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 19 December 2002 and will be available through the Contracts Competency homepage Web site at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to perform the requirement or submit a proposal.  Responses/proposals must be received within 45 days from date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete the requirement, based on responses received, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Technical POC:   Mr. Brian McKeon, Program Manager, (315) 330-7348, email:  Brian.McKeon@rl.af.mil.   Contracting POC: IFKA, Contracting Officer, email:  AFRL/IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The Sensors Directorate, Photonics Technology Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of microwave photonics.  Specific areas of interest to be addressed in this BAA include devices, components, and techniques for the analog modulation of optical carriers, including both external and direct modulation, to achieve high spur free dynamic range performance. The goal of this program is: Two-tone spur free dynamic range > 130 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth, at 10 GHz  center frequency, with bandwidth > 3 GHz. Issues of concern include ease of fabrication and fabrication tolerances, performance stability, ease of implementation, and potential for extending performance to higher frequencies and wider bandwidths, ( nominally 2 -20 GHz).  Furthermore, approaches to achieving high modulation linearity must also be consistent with the ability to also achieve high modulation efficiency.  While demonstration of high modulation efficiency is not required, the viability of achieving this goal should be shown.  For the purposes of this effort, we define modulation efficiency for an external modulator (fiber coupled) to be the slope of the transfer curve normalized with respect to input optical power, Sext(1/Volt), and for a directly modulated laser to be the fiber coupled slope efficiency Sdir (Watts/Amp).  Our goals are: Sext > 0.75 (1/V); and Sdir > 1 (W/A). Deliverables will include technical reports, technology demonstrations which prove out the concepts proposed, and samples of components and devices developed.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a four (4) to ten (10) page white paper on their proposed research topic with a cover letter.  All responses to this BAA must be addressed to:  AFRL/SNDP, Attn:   Mr. Brian McKeon, 25 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4515.   The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Objective, Section C: Task Objective and, Section D:  Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  White papers must reference BAA 03-01-IFKA, and shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY-03, 30 DEC 02; FY-04, 1 Jun 03; FY-05, 1 Jun 04; FY-06, 1 Jun 05.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.   It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, (2) The potential contribution and relevance to the Air Force mission and, (3) cost benefits. The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously.  Criteria (1) and (2) will be used to determine whether the white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.   In addition, the Government may consider other factors such as:  (1) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (2) The qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel; and (3) The offeror's record of past and present performance.   
Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement begins in FY03. Individual awards will not normally exceed twenty-four (24) months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. Total funding for the BAA is $4,500,000.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.   
Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer at email IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The e-mail must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission and reference BAA #03-01-IFKA.   This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 06.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point at IFKA@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description:   THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRDA MODIFICATION #6 IS TO PROVIDE A LIST OF THE TWENTY SEVEN (27) SHIPS THAT MARAD CONSIDERS TO BE HIGH PRIORITY FOR DISPOSAL BASED ON THEIR MATERIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 5, 2002. THIS LIST IS ONLY PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES BASED ON INQUIRIES FROM INDUSTRY. DUE TO CONTINUOUS VESSEL CONDITION ASSESSMENTS AND TIME, THIS LIST IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS VESSELS ARE ADDED TO OR REMOVED FROM THE LIST BASED ON UPDATED ASSESSMENTS AND DISPOSAL ACTIONS.  
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
?Y Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
?Y Production throughput/capacity
?Y Environmental considerations
?Y Worker safety and health considerations
?Y Hazardous abatement considerations
?Y Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror?s may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

 Instructions for the Submission of Proposals:
Initial responses to this PRDA must be submitted not later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on November15, 2001 to:

	U.S. Department of Transportation
	Maritime Administration
	Office of Acquisition, MAR-380
	400 Seventh Street S.W., Room 7310
	Washington DC 20590
	Attn: Ms. Rilla Gaither

Offerors must submit five (5) complete copies for each proposed approach, inclusive of  technical/engineering/production/management and funding/pricing proposals. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  

It is the intent of the Maritime Administration that this notice be valid until 1 year from the initial date of posting, unless otherwise canceled/amended. 

Subsequent proposal submission periods under this PRDA are as follows, unless otherwise canceled/amended:

	January 7 ? 11, 2002
	April 1 ? 5, 2002
	July 8 ? 12, 2002

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), General and Industrial Directorate, is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor for the roll out of the Facilities Maintenance Services Initiative. The goal is to have a multi-service multiple award contract vehicle that would allow base facility managers to order services on an as-needed basis.
The initiative will encompass all services associated with facilities maintenance.   The areas that will be targeted include: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, fire alarms, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition and facility operations. This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all services that will be in the initiative.  The initial implementation was awarded in September of 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States. This roll out region defined as the Southeast Region of the Continental United States (CONUS) target audience will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In addition, military bases and other Federal activities located in Puerto Rico and the American Virgin Islands are included in the Southeast Region. 

Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum potential of $100 million annually.  The maximum dollar value is contingent on the number of facilities and the extent of the participation of those facilities at any given time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235990, facilities maintenance services.  

Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contracts being firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity.   One of the resultant contracts will be reserved for a small business provided that at least two responsible small business concerns will submit competitive proposals under this solicitation.  The performance period will be for five years, including a two-year base period with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Oral presentations will be a part of the technical evaluation. All information submitted is at the offeror?s expense. The Government is not responsible for any aspect of transportation to or from the location for the oral presentation.  Solicitation number SP0500-02-R-0038 will be issued on 02 DEC 2002 with a closing date of 16 JAN 2003.   After the initial contracts are awarded, all services will be procured through the issuance of individual task orders, each one defined by a separate statement of work. All industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services are requested to obtain a copy of this solicitation that can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home. From the Gateway homepage, select Search RFPs from the left-hand sidebar. Then choose the RFP you wish to view. You must be registered in order to download RFPs.  If you are not, follow the prompts and you will be instructed on how to get registered at time of download. RFPs are in portable document format (PDF).

<CONTACT>B. A. Hartlage TELEPHONE 812-854-1882
<DESC>The Navy is seeking sources to design, develop, integrate, test, install and support Scaleable Operations Center Systems (SOCS).  Current high technology Command and Control (C2) systems require an extensive array of power, network, and video cables in order to achieve successful integration of a multi-workstation environment.  The need for rapidly deployable C2 systems requires the necessary components to quickly establish a C2 system within the confines of a rapidly deployable shelter (tent) environment.  The hardware that can achieve this includes a framework to support large screen displays and projection surfaces, as well as cable management of the myriad power, network, and video cabling.  The system must have internal mechanical separation of power, classified networks, unclassified networks and computer video.  It must have embedded network switches to optimize cable mana gement.  SOCS provide modular components to support tactical communications and data systems, video display systems, and tactical rapidly deployable shelter systems to support mobile military forces.  The modular nature of SOCS allow units to maximize the capability of their existing C2 systems, information, video, network and telephone systems.  Components obtained would be integrated with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to provide maximum scalability to support configurations required for a specific C2 environment.  The scaleable nature of SOCS provides flexibility to provide this capability across the spectrum from a single user to a twenty-user environment.  This effort will include procuring, fabricating, and integrating communications equipment, materials for tactical furniture, computer systems, video display systems (to include projection systems and truss mounting  systems), and rapidly deployable shelter systems and accessories.  The majority of components to be integrated will be commercial off the shelf (COTS) items that require little or no modification.  The contractor would also be expected to provide on-site technical and logistics support.  In order to support mobility requirements, the system must be able to be transported in protective packing cases and must be rapidly deployable by either military or civilian transportation systems (to include military air lift).  Please submit, on or before 20 December 2003, company literature, resumes, references, and any other pertinent information for the Governments evaluation.  Include business status (e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone, women-owned, etc.) and reference N00164-03-R-6611.  POC: B. A. Hartlage, 812-854-1882, hartlage_b@crane.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for the regulation of national banks.  OCC is headquartered in Washington, DC, with district and field offices nation-wide.  Because all of the OCC office space is leased, the OCC is continuously involved in relocation and renovation activity.  Currently, relocation and renovation activity is planned for the OCC Denver District and Field Offices.

This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information announcement issued in accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research.  The OCC requests information on the feasibility of an acquisition strategy that entails a furniture dealer to manage the purchase, storage, delivery and installation of office furniture for the Denver, CO locations.  Potential manufacturers include Rudd or Davis for conference, task and visitor chairs; Steelcase for file cabinets, table desks and work chairs; Howe for training tables; and Herman Miller or Haworth or Steelcase for case goods for private offices.  The estimated budget for furniture for the Denver offices is $400K to $500K.

The OCC anticipates award of a fixed-price contract around March 2003, with delivery and installation to be completed by September 2003.  A dealer with an established presence in the local Denver area is preferred.  A Project Manager is required to serve as the single point of contact with the OCC in order to coordinate all aspects of the project.  

A solicitation is not available at this time.  The OCC requests brief written statements from responsible companies, indicating their capability to meet this requirement.  The response should include at least three references for work of a similar nature, as well as list any commercial interior architectural firms with which the respondent has worked in the past.  Please address any special terms and conditions or standard industry practices that the OCC should consider in finalizing its acquisition strategy.  Information provided in response to this announcement should be mailed to the address indicated.  Questions or requests for additional information may be faxed to (202)874-5625 or emailed to marguerite.brown@occ.treas.gov.  Telephone inquiries are discouraged.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NFFN7300300023
<RESPDATE>112702
<CONTACT>Jeanie  Jennings , Contract Specialist , Phone 816-426-7267, Fax 816-426-7530, Email Jeanie.M.Jennings@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, Central Administrative Support Agency is seeking sources who can or have Designed and Developed a Hook Timer Assembly prototype.  The National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories in cooperation with the Atlantic Pelagic Longline Fishery, NMFS Sustainable Fisheries Division, and Protected Resources Division is conducting research to develop mitigation measures to reduce endangered and threatened sea turtle mortality associated with pelagic longline gear.  A significant need in the research is the development of a reliable device to measure trends in time and depth of sea turtle captures to reveal particular time intervals or depth of longline operations for which turtles are most vulnerable.  Experiments conducted in 2001 and 2002 revealed that hook daylight soak time is a significant variable in determining loggerhead turtle cpue by pelagic longline gear.  This data has resulted in a proposal to develop a timed bait release that could be used to avoid turtle interaction by releasing baits during the time when turtles are most vulnerable.  This technique could also be applied to reduce other longline bycatch, but neither can be accomplished without specific information on the times and depths at which turtles, target species, and other bycatch species interact with longline gear.  IT IS CRITICAL TO THIS PROJECT THAT RELIABLE HOOK TIMERS BE DEVELOPED, TESTED AND DELIVERED PRIOR TO THE 2003 FISHING SEASON (JULY 2003).

The following specifications describe the hook timer assembly units; however alternate proposals for a different design accomplishing the same goal for timing and giving consideration to the restrictions on exterior surface obstructions and weight, as well as the environment in which the units will be operating, will be considered for award.

The Hook Timer Assembly must operate reliably within a hostile marine environment of extreme temperature, pressure and vibration (shock).  The units must withstand temperatures of 0 degrees to 48 degrees C pressure of atmosphere to 700 PSI and shock force of ten (10) gravity.

The mechanical housing must provide a clear view of the liquid crystal display be equipped with eyelets which allow a quick and efficient attachment to the gangion, permit the installation of new batteries, provide a method for adjusting the tension force from two (2) pounds to ten (10) pounds at one (1) pound increments for the activation magnet removal.  Shall contain no obstructions on the exterior surface, which would snag during deployment or contribute to entanglement of the main longline.  The operational package shall be small light weight (less than one pound) naturally buoyant with minimal adverse effect from sunlight.

The electronics shall consist of a clock module (VOSCA Corporation CM-42A or equivalent) containing a liquid crystal display (LED) powered by one 1.5V AAA lithium battery, activated by a magnetically contained reed switch.  The clock assembly shall be designed such that when the magnet is removed power is applied through the magnetic reed switch contacts starting the counter.  The clock shall run continuously for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours and display the lapse time in the LCD in hours and minutes.  The electronics must not be encapsulated in a solid potting material thus preventing failure from temperature changes.  In the event AAA lithium batteries are unavailable, alkaline may be substituted provided a means to substitute lithium at a later time is provided.

Firms who can meet the above requirements shall respond to this sources sought announcement by 1:00 pm CDST on 27 November 2002.  Qualifications which make your firm responsive and responsible to this sources sought must be included in your response and mailed to Contracting Officer as given below:  U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA; 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a solicitation.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this announcement.  
All questions relating to this announcement shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Jean Jennings at Jeanie.M.Jennings@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of anti-CD 30 immunotoxins for the treatment of cancer
<DESC>To develop a novel therapeutic agent to treat Hodgkin's disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, NCI has  made a panel of recombinant immunotoxins specific for CD30 using Fvs of newly produced anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and a truncated mutant of Pseudomonas exotoxin. CD30 is highly expressed on both Hodgkin's disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. NCI is currently seeking cooperative partners to work with the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the development and clinical application of immunotoxins directed against CD 30 epitopes found on cells in Hodgkin's Lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Potential Areas of Application:

?	Treatment of Hodgkin's Lymphoma
?	Treatment of anaplastic large cell lymphoma
	
Main Advantages of Technology/Invention
Recombinant immunotoxins are chimeric proteins in which a truncated toxin is fused to the Fv
portion of an antibody. The binding activity of the Fv moiety targets the immunotoxins to antigen-positive cells, which are killed by the cytotoxic activity of the toxin moiety. For cancer therapy NCI has produced many different recombinant immunotoxins using PE383 that lacks its cell binding domain and Fvs that bind to tumor-related antigens or to differentiation antigens such as CD22 and CD25. NCI has also improved the therapeutic potency of several immunotoxins by protein engineering and chemical modification. These efforts have been directed at making immunotoxins that are smaller for better tumor penetration, that are less immunogenic and less toxic to animals, that bind antigen with higher affinity, that are more stable, and that are suitable for large-scale production. One of the important advances is the development of dsFvs in which one of the immunoglobulin variable chains genetically fused with PE38 is linked with the other chain by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues engineered in the framework region of each chain. These immunotoxins showed greater stability in vivo and in vitro than the widely used scFv forms. Recent clinical trials indicate that targeted therapy by recombinant immunotoxins shows great promise especially for some types of hematologic malignancies. The anti-CD25 scFv immunotoxin, LMB-2, produced major clinical responses in various types of leukemia and lymphoma, and the anti-CD22 immunotoxin, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38, gave a remarkable high rate of complete remissions in patients with drug resistant Hairy cell leukemia. 
	

Current State of Development
?	In vitro demonstration of toxicity.
	
Further R&D Required
?	To identify modifications to the immunotoxin molecule to increase anti-tumor activity and to decrease immunogenicity.
?	To conduct in vivo tests of anti-tumor activity.
