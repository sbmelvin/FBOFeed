<DESC>"Razorback Sucker Selenium Effects Study" 

Notice Type: SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: 1. NOTICE: This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:  (1) to determine if responsible Indian Economic Enterprises (IEE) sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a IEE Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 813312 which has a corresponding size standards millions of dollars $15.0. The government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in IEE business concerns. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. 

2.  BACKGROUND:  This study is being funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support various consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Water quality concerns associated with irrigation return flows from projects such as the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project  (NIIP) were first identified in the preliminary findings of a Department of Interior study (DOI 1991). This study did find low level pesticide contamination in the San Juan River but the concentrations were below concentrations of concern. Of the contaminants found, only selenium (Se) was found to be directly associated with NIIP. Rehabilitation is planned for the San Juan Irrigation Systems along the Hogback and Fruitland Canals where Se loading from irrigation returns flows is also a concern.  Selenium will also need to be addressed in upcoming consultations due to lease renewals for the PNM San Juan Generating Station and the APS Four Corners Power Plant, both located west of Farmington.


Within the San Juan River, there are two endangered fish species, razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) and Colorado pikeminnow (Ptycocheilus lucius), and one candidate species, roundtail chub (Gila Robusta). Studies by Hamilton and Buhl (1995, 1996) demonstrate that Se toxicity is highest for razorback sucker larvae, followed by flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), and Colorado pikeminnow (least sensitive). Since the razorback sucker is the most Se sensitive endangered fish in the San Juan River, by determining the appropriate chronic Se toxicity threshold for razorback sucker the Colorado pikeminnow will also be protected.

The razorback sucker is one of the largest suckers in North America; growing up to 3 feet long and weighing up to 13 pounds. Breeding males turn gray-black with an orange belly. They were listed as endangered under federal law in 1991. The razorback sucker critical habitat includes the San Juan River and its 100 year flood plain from Neskahai Canyon in Lake Powell to the Hogback diversion dam (Bliesner and Lamarra 1999). 


The overall goal of this study is to determine the chronic tissue residue Se threshold that impairs overall reproductive health and vigor of the razorback sucker in the San Juan River. This will be accomplished by developing a Se dose-response curve for razorback suckers, determining the chronic effects of Se on hatchability, teratogenicity, growth, survival, and reproduction of razorback sucker from a range of combined waterborne exposure and dietary organic selenium exposure, relating these effects to razorback sucker egg Se concentrations in a controlled setting. Another aspect of this study that should be addressed within the proposals is how the laboratory based dose-response curve and chronic toxicity results for razorbacks can be extrapolated to wild San Juan River razorback sucker skeletal muscle Se concentrations so that the San Juan River razorback sucker Se toxicity can be easily monitored by collecting muscle plugs. Mathematical relationships for Se concentrations between muscle plug and whole body and muscle plug and egg shall be developed for San Juan River razorback sucker. This shall be similar to the work done by Osmundson and Skorupa on other species (Osmundson, 2011). These mathematical relationships must be applicable to the San Juan River

3. PROJECT REQUIREMENT:  All standard operating procedures (SOPs) used in this study shall comply with the Good Laboratory Practice outlined in the latest Federal Register (40 CFR 160). Fish used in the study shall be treated according to all current state, federal, and institutional guidelines.


The frequency of teratogenic deformities in early development stages of fish continues to be the most useful indicator of Se toxicity.   Thus, this is very similar in objective and design to the Colorado pikeminnow Se toxicity study conducted by Hamilton and Buhl (2000), except this study will examine razorback sucker Se toxicity.  Proposals shall make recommendations as to the need and importance to mimic the water chemistry of the San Juan River. This raises questions on how to address the interaction of other constituents specific to the San Juan River that could have antagonistic or synergistic effects on Se toxicity. Recommendations to mimic or not mimic the San Juan River water chemistry shall be well documented. At minimum, the basic chemistry (major cations and anions, electrical conductivity and pH typical of the winter flow conditions in the San Juan River at Shiprock, should be maintained in the treatment water. If further mimicry is suggested, the proposed scope of work shall describe how antagonistic and synergistic effects on Se toxicity will be addressed. 

Listed are the key components recommended for this study. Some of these components were derived from the Hamilton and Buhl (2000) protocol. These are only recommendations and the proposal can deviate from these components as long as justification for doing so is included:  Securing and Handling of Fish; Adult Exposure Study Phase; Egg Viability Study Phase; Larvae Viability Study Phase; Development of Mathematical Relationship; and other requirements.

4. ANTICPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Delivery 5 year after receipt of the Notice to proceed.

5. CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION: (Please limit submission to 20 pages).  Capability statement must reference the ability to provide all of the items. Potential offerors must include in their capability statement the point of contact, organization name, address, Dunn and Bradstreet number (DUNS), size and type of business pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. Interested Contractors must provide the above information to the point of contact listed herein. Information submitted shall be in sufficient detail for a decision to be made based on the criteria previously mentioned.  Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after April 15, 2014 will be answered.  Submission Information: Interested sources submission must be clear, concise, complete, and be submitted via e-mail by 3:00 pm MDT on April 20, 2014 to Mary Jane Johnson at maryjane.johnson@bia.gov.

6. CONCLUDING: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted

<DESC>Title: PICOM Cloud Licenses and Support
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS),&nbsp;Morgantown, WV 26505 intents to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Scimage, Inc., 4916 El Camino Real, Ste 200, Los Altos, CA 94022-1445 for PICOM Cloud Licenses and Support. <br />Other software may be able to accomplish this requirement, but we would have to design, validate, and implement a complete system that would cost much more than buying additional licenses. Scimage is the only company that provides the support proprietary PICOM Cloud software that we already use for 80 radiography facilities. <br />Statement of Work<br />Title: PICOM Cloud Licenses and Support Period of Performance: 5/1/2015 to 4/30/2016<br />SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND <br />NIOSH approved radiograph facilities (hospitals, clinics, and mobile health units) send digital radiographs to NIOSH as part of the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP). The CWHSP was created to improve the health of our nation's coal miners and occupational health research. An information system was purchased and implemented in 2009 to enable NIOSH to receive, manage, classify, and store digital radiographs. The original contracts (200-2009-32569 and 254-2010-35292) were awarded to ScImage in Los Altos, CA. ScImage provided a complete customized hardware and software solution that included 80 Picom Cloud software licenses for radiograph facilities. The contracts included optional technical support and updates that could be exercised on an annual basis. The PICOM Cloud portion of that support ends on 8/31/2015, and we have used all 80 of the software licenses. The PICOM Enterprise portion of the support ends on 4/30/2016. <br />SUBSECTION A - DEFINITIONS <br />DICOM - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine is the standard for distributing and viewing any kind of medical image.<br />Active Directory - a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks that is used by CDC to identify and authenticate employees and contractors that need access to the CDC network.<br />LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory servers over a network. LDAP is not used at CDC and only Active Directory is supported.<br />Secure ID Key fob - a security token that displays a cyclic number that allows the assigned person to access the CDC network allow with their user identification and password.<br />SECTION 2 - PURPOSE<br />NIOSH needs to purchase 50 additional PICOM Cloud licenses; obtain an annual agreement for custom reporting/Active Directory software support and updates for the Surveillance Image Management System (SIMS); and renew the annual agreement for technical support and remote server updates from 9/1/2015 to 4/30/2016 (8 months). The CWHSP was expanded in 2014 and we have new facilities that need to use the system and send radiographs to NIOSH. Technical support is needed to have ScImage available to fix problems and install updates. ScImage can provide the software licenses, updates, and technical support. The software licenses are needed as soon as the purchase is approved and the tech support is to be provided during the performance dates.<br />SECTION 3 - SCOPE OF WORK<br />The contract should include the following deliverables and services.<br />&bull; Picom Cloud DICOM Transfer software for 50 new sites.<br />&bull; Remote support, testing, and validation for 50 new sites. Each site requires various levels of support needed to troubleshoot and solve any technical problems that are encountered. Remote desktop software should be provided and maintained by the contractor and is only installed at the contractor's location.<br />&bull; Remote support management and meetings. Some of the remote support may require a meeting with NIOSH or assessment of the problem to determine staff assignment.<br />&bull; Picom Cloud software updates. Regular software updates are needed to keep components compatible with the operating systems and internet browsers. Software updates may also be needed when information security requirements change. Picom Cloud software updates will be for a period of 8 months between 9/1/2015 and 4/30/2016.<br />&bull; Picom Cloud remote server support. The contractor will need to connect to the CDC network and install updates on the NIOSH server. Picom Cloud server support will be for a period of 8 months between 9/1/2015 and 4/30/2016.* <br />&bull; Custom reporting software support and updates. The contractor should provide remote technical support and updates for the custom reporting software that was installed in 2010 that allows physicians to complete a classification of each radiograph and automatically send the electronic report to NIOSH for processing.*<br />&bull; Active Directory / LDAP interface support and updates. The contractor should provide remote technical support and updates for the custom active directory interface that was installed in 2014 by ScImage (contract 211-2013-55955). The active directory software allows NIOSH to authenticate using the network credentials provided by CDC and conform to CDC information security requirements.*</p>
<p>* The person(s) providing the remote support for the Picom Cloud server, custom reporting software, and active directory interface will need to receive the necessary background checks and credentials for accessing the CDC network.<br />SECTION 4 - TASKS TO BE PERFORMED<br />The contractor will determine the tasks needed to provide the services provided under this contract. <br />SECTION 5 - GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS <br />The government will furnish the security credentials and Secure ID key fobs to access the CDC network for no more than 3 of the contractor's employees. No other equipment or materials are provided by the government.<br />SECTION 6 - PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />&bull; Payment for the software licenses and remote installation support is payable upon delivery of the software licenses to NIOSH. The remote support for new facilities is to be provided when needed as long as NIOSH has an active support contract in place with the contractor. <br />&bull; Software support and updates for the custom reporting and active directory interface are to be provided between 5/1/2015 and 4/30/2016 (or from actual award date until 4/30/2016). Payable on or after 5/1/2015 (or actual award date).<br />&bull; Remote server support and updates for NIOSH to be provided between 9/1/2015 and 4/30/2016. Payable on or after 9/1/2015.</p>
<p>SECTION 7 - PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />All support is remote and provided during normal business days and hours. The contractor is not required to travel to CDC, NIOSH, or health facilities. The Picom Cloud server is located at CDC and will remain in that location.<br />Remote desktop software is to be used to support new facilities installations. <br />CDC credentials and portals are to be used for computers and systems located at CDC or NIOSH.<br />SECTION 8 - DELIVERABLES/REPORTING SCHEDULE <br />Items Description Quantity or No. of Copies Delivery Date Deliver To<br />Picom Cloud software licenses<br />DICOM transfer software that requires no installation at health facilities.<br />50<br />5/1/2015<br />NIOSH/DRDS, 1095 Willowdale Rd, Morgantown, WV 26505</p>
<p>A certificate or proof of purchase should be provided by the contractor.<br />Technical support and updates should be tracked by the contractor.<br />SECTION 9 - TRAVEL<br />No travel requirements.<br />This contract action is for a product for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) and 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1).

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Regulatory, Analytical, and Evaluation Support Services for Radiation Protection Programs. The mission of the Radiation Protection Division (RPD) of the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) is to establish and manage a national program to ensure that public health and the environment are protected from the risks of unnecessary exposure to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. ORIA accomplishes its mission by developing and implementing standards and guidance, fostering the use of innovative technologies, and serving as a reliable source of credible information on issues related to radiation protection.
<p>Major program areas include (1) Radioactive Waste Disposal and Management (e.g., WIPP, Yucca Mountain, TENORM, Low Activity Waste, clean materials, disposal of waste from weapons of mass destruction); (2) Cleanup (e.g., radioactively contaminated sites, federal guidance, technology assessment, risk modeling); (3) Air Toxics [e.g., NESHAPs (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants)]; and (4) related areas (e.g., modeling, risk assessment, risk harmonization, Toxics Release Inventory, radiation information management).</p>
<p>Contractor support is required for the development and implementation of regulations and guidance; the development and support of voluntary partnerships and programs; the evaluation and characterization of radiation sources and their disposition through the environment; the development of guidance and site-specific analyses associated with remediation; the evaluation of innovative technologies, and the provision of reliable public information on issues related to radiation protection. To provide this support, the Contractor shall be familiar with all significant Agency policies/practices and guidance and be able to prepare documents and deliverables that meet "plain English" requirements. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, hardware and software, services, and facilities to perform any work as specified in work assignments.</p>
<p>The EPA anticipates the award of a cost-plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The anticipated contract award date is November 16, 2015. The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty (60) months for a total of 101,000 labor hours consisting of a base quantity of 13,000 labor hours and 6,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base year and each option period (with the exception that Option Period 4 will have 10,000 optional quantity labor hours). This effort is a follow-on to contract EP-D-10-042 with SC&amp;A which expires on November 15, 2015. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $15M in average annual receipts over the last three years.</p>
<p>The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on or around April 27, 2015 as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology (hereinafter referred to as "Technology").   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the Technology under a sponsored research agreement.
<p>THE PATENT-PENDING TECHNOLOGY IS:  An advanced high-energy density, aqueous zinc polyiodide flow battery that efficiently converts chemical energy to electrical energy without the use of expensive catalysts or membranes. By storing its active chemicals separately until power is needed, it greatly reduces safety concerns. The battery uses a highly soluble iodide/triiodide redox couple that has more than two times the energy density of the all-vanadium flow battery, while overcoming problems associated with the corrosive bromide ion and bromine gas in current zinc bromide batteries.  The battery may be used to improve reliability of the power grid, accelerate adoption of renewable energy generation sources (wind / solar), and potentially enable mobile applications such as powering trains and cars.</p>
<p>See also http://availabletechnologies.pnnl.gov/technology.asp?id=403</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 30441.</p>
<p>NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing the Technology must respond with a Letter of Interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than forty-five (45) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the Technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  <br />Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the Technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 30441.</p>

Provide new siding, roofing, wall insulation, roof insulation, and mechanical ventilation. Modifications to existing fire sprinkler and electrical system will be included.  <br>   <br> The solicitation will be posted on FBO at www.fbo.gov on or about 1 May 2015. <br>  <br> For information concerning NAICS and SBA size standards, go to http://www.sba.gov/content/small-businesssizestandards. <br>  <br> Interested contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database to receive a government contract award.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler St., Fort Detrick, Maryland, 21702, intends to award a sole source contract to Bio-Rad Laboratories for maintenance and repair of a Bio-Plex 200 System with HTF for the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR). The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2). The FAR citation is 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  <br>  <br> Bio-Rad Laboratories is uniquely qualified to provide the required service as it is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  As the OEM, Bio-Rad Laboratories possesses the qualification to perform repairs, upgrades and preventive maintenance (PM) services on the very delicate and advanced Bio-Plex 200 system.  Due to the highly specialized nature of the experiments being conducted, it is important to maintain system consistency, and Bio-Rad Laboratories reagents can only be used on Bio-Rad Laboratories equipment.  Since the Bio-Plex 200 system is relatively new to the market, no other known sources are capable of adequately performing this needed service. <br>  <br> RFQ W81XWH-15-T-0171 will be issued on a sole source basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219 and the small business size standard is $20.5M. Any sources that believe they are eligible to provide these services must respond in writing or respond to the RFQ. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence which articulates the ability to perform the services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the purchase order will be awarded without further remark.  <br>  <br> All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ms. Samantha L. Connors at samantha.l.connors.civ@mail.mil. Interested concerns must identify their capability to the above email address no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 28 April 2015. <br>

<SUBJECT>192" Dynamometer - Landing Gear Test Facility
<SOLNBR>FA2486-16-R-0009
<RESPDATE>042715
<CONTACT>Jonathan A. Heitkam, Contracting Officer, Phone 5755721245, Email jonathan.heitkam.2@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The Government is seeking information from all sources regarding a potential contract to upgrade a 192 inch dynamometer at the 96th Test Group, OL-AC, Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF), located at Wright-Paterson AFB, OH. Respondents will not be notified of the responses to this RFI. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this notice is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary" or "Confidential" will not be disclosed outside of Government channels. While a final decision has not been determined, the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is preliminarily set as 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing (Dynamometers Manufacturing). A set-aside determination has not been made, but is being considered. The Product and Services Code (PSC) is 6659, Combination and Miscellaneous Instruments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p>The mission of LGTF is to test various aspects of existing and prototype landing gear for the Department of Defense and its partners over a number of differing airframe configurations. The LGTF houses a variety of test equipment to test landing gear and landing gear components. In broad terms, there are dynamometers, drop towers, loading machines, and associated test support equipment.</p>
<p>The 192 inch dynamometer at the LGTF is a world unique aircraft brake dynamometer. The dynamometer was designed and built during the World War II timeframe and has continued to provide unique brake testing capabilities to this day. It is an important tool for safety of flight brake performance evaluation. It does, however, have short comings in its performance with respect to drive torque, top speed, adjustable carriage, and the control system.</p>
<p>The 192" dynamometer is a variable inertia test system. To accomplish a test the flywheel / plates are spun up to an appropriate landing speed, an aircraft tire / wheel / brake assembly is hydraulically loaded against it, and the aircraft brake is made to stop the spinning mass. A stop replicates the energy the brake would have to absorb in service. Presently there is an upper carriage, a south carriage, and a north carriage. The dynamometer has a top speed of 200 mph. It is powered by a 400 hp motor. The present north carriage has only one axis of control for vertical load. The physical floor footprint of the present machine is approximately 56' by 48'. <br />The 192" dynamometer flywheel is 16 foot in diameter and 11 foot in length. The estimated weight of the bare flywheel, flywheel shaft, bolts, nuts, and bearings is 40,000 lb. Adding all of the bolt-on inertia plates gives a conservative total estimated weight of 325,000 lb.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 2 - PURPOSE OF RFI:</span></strong></p>
<p>This notice is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of meeting LGTF's upgrade requirements. The Government intends to use information gathered from industry to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support the formulation of an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 3 - SCOPE OVERVIEW:</span></strong></p>
<p>The modernized new system shall be based upon upgrading the present 192" diameter dynamometer. At its core will be a 192" variable inertia drum. It is assumed that the equipment will sit in the same physical footprint, and interface with the existing foundational tie-ins. <br />There are several keys subsystems that require modernization:<br />1. The flywheel / inertia plate system<br />2. The motor / motor drive system<br />3. The data acquisition and control system<br />4. The north carriage load application system</p>
<p>The baseline assumption is that these subsystems will need to be removed in total and replaced with newly designed and fabricated equipment. Please see the attached Draft Requirements for additional information</p>
<p>It shall be the awardee's responsibility to demolish or remove existing equipment as needed, design, build, and install all the new equipment. The new system shall go through a functional checkout and satisfactorily pass acceptance testing prior to turn over to the Air Force. The awardee shall hold to standard engineering design practices with appropriate reviews and approvals from the Government.</p>
<p>The awardee will be required to develop a complete engineering and installation plan. The plan will need to be tailored to track funding as well as meet specific milestones. Due to the current utilization of the 192 test system, downtime must be minimized. The awardee will be responsible for subcontracting the various subsystem vendors as needed and for all construction / demolition contracts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 4 - INDUSTRY DAY </span></strong></p>
<p>An Industry Day for the LGTF 192" Dynamometer upgrade effort will be held In May 2015 additional information will be posted on Fed Biz Ops when it becomes available.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 5 - RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capability statement not to exceed 20 pages in length including any pictures, diagrams and other materials. If submitted electronically, all responses must be provided in a Microsoft Office or Adobe format. Physical submissions must include original plus two (2) copies.<br />Capability statements should include as a minimum:<br />1. Company Name, Address, <br />2.

<DESC>DO NOT CONTACT POSTER - L. NEWHOUSE.  FOR ANY INFORMATION CONTACT:  Amy Parker, (443)861-2958 <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only, and is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and possible issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any non-profit organization or small business programs. The Army is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of response to this Sources Sought Notice. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for bids and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Army. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Army to solicit for or award a contract. Unless otherwise stated herein, no solicitation regarding this announcement is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Please be aware that all information submitted in response to this request, whether written, oral, electronic, graphic, or any other medium, may be subject to disclosure upon receipt of a proper Freedom of Information Act request from any person. The Army will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis, and submittals will not be returned to the sender. <br>  <br> The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Logistics and Readiness Center (LRC), in conjunction with the Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare & Sensors (PEO IEW&S) and the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) are seeking industry ideas and solutions to address the technical capabilities that the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions will need to dominate the net-centric operational environment of the future using CDL and SATCOM.   <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice seeks viable and proven approaches for sustainment of current and next-generation manned and unmanned ISR airborne and ground platforms employed by the US Army using CDL and SATCOM. <br>  <br> Introduction: CDL and SATCOM provide the Department of Defense (DoD) standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, ISR data links for numerous DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms.  CECOM, PEO IEW&S, and INSCOM manage airborne and ground systems and sensors and are jointly responsible for the US Army's ISR mission.  A critical component of these ISR systems is the ability to transfer secured high bandwidth data over CDL and SATCOM between ground, air, and space segments in near real time with high assurance so that intelligence products can be produced, exploited, and disseminated in order to maintain battlefield dominance. <br>  <br> Background: Over the past two decades the previously stated ISR systems have been 100% sustained via a Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) approach.  In addition, during the past several years, the DoD and other US Departments and Agencies have invested heavily in high-resolution/advanced airborne sensors on manned and unmanned ISR platforms with the primary requirements centered around imagery, signals intelligence, radar collection, and data networking.  This investment has resulted in the creation of an ISR Enterprise that allows significant flexibility in manpower placement for processing the sensor data.  This enterprise has resulted in the Army's ability to reduce  quote mark boots on the ground quote mark  in deployed locations.  There has also been a significant increase in the number of ISR platforms and sensors, an increase in the data rate of sensors, the amount and type of data collected, and the number of users (to include tactical, allied, and coalition).  <br>  <br> Scope: This Sources Sought Notice is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in development, production, integration, systems engineering, operations, maintenance (inclusive of field and sustainment levels), and test of complex Over the Horizon (OTH) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) CDL, Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), and SATCOM systems and their component parts and software.  For the purpose of this Sources Sought Notice, the US Army considers the applicable CDL and SATCOM antennae, receivers, transmitters, amplifiers, software and associated bandwidth to all be integral components of subject effort in an attempt to maintain the Army's ISR Enterprise end-to-end solution.  The Army's intent is to maintain the current equipment set as requirements dictate.  CDL data throughput rates up to and including 274 megabytes per second are required.  Applicable SATCOM terminals must meet Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) certifications.  The Army desires to continue dialog with those Industry partners who feel they could be a viable prime contractor capable of performing the following activities:    <br>   <br> 1.	Maintain, repair, and sustain existing Army owned CDL/SATCOM equipment for which the US Army does not own the Technical Data Package (TDP).  This list of CDL/SATCOM equipment includes but is not limited to VORTEX, Extended Network Terminal (ENT), Guardrail Interoperable Airborne Network Terminal (GIANT), Mini-TCDL, Mini-TCDL2, VORTEX Satellite Modem (VSM), Gen-2 TCDL, Mini Router, Tactical Wideband Interoperability Surface Terminal (TWISTER), Space-Based CDL, Tri-band Satellite System (TSS), Deployable Multi-Channel SATCOM (DMCS), Transportable Medium Earth Terminal (TMET), Tactical Satellite Terminal (TST), Quad-band Satellite Terminal (QST), Joint Test and Integration Facility (JTIF), System Test and Integration Facility (STIF), Multi-Role TCDL (MR-TCDL), One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT), Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) family, and Automated Message Guard (AMG). <br> 2.	Provide depot support to include but not limited to provisioning, field-to-depot requisitioning, inventory control and storage for current/future unclassified and classified components, and maintaining test bed capabilities for applicable CDL/SATCOM equipment. <br> 3.	Provide Field Support Representatives (FSRs) for existing and future Army owned CDL/SATCOM equipment worldwide.  This support will include operations, on-site maintenance, trouble shooting, diagnostics, repair and replacement of failed modules and components, testing, on-site spare parts custodial support, and ISR mission support.  FSRs must maintain a Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearance, Level II Information Assurance Network Certification, and must be qualified for worldwide deployment.  FSRs will support Site Surveys and provide On-The-Job Training as required.  Historically, in excess of fifteen (15) FSRs at any point in time supported this portion of the Army's overall ISR mission in the Continental United States (CONUS), Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), and Combat Zones.       <br> 4.	Demonstrate compliance with Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current and future operations. <br> 5.	Provide effective end-to-end engineering support to ensure the least possible latency. This may include SATCOM bandwidth to support worldwide operations from airborne and ground sensors/sensor nodes.  This may also include Host Nation Agreements (HNA) for landing rights.      <br>  <br> Data Submission Requirements:  All material submitted in response to this notice must be unclassified. Interested parties possessing the ability to provide product outlined above are requested to provide a response in electronic format describing their capabilities and should address the following items: <br>  <br> 1.	A Statement of Interest (SOI) along with concepts and strategies to support the activities envisioned under a CDL Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) for the US Army CDL and SATCOM community. <br> 2.   A Statement of Capabilities (SOC) describing qualifications as a prospective contractor. The Army will use the information from the SOCs to determine how many contractors are currently capable of meeting the Army's requirements.  Given the Government's limited data rights and lack of technical data, please provide documentation describing how currently owned US Army systems will be maintained, repaired, and sustained. <br> 3.   Identify past TCDL/CDL and SATCOM operational experience and existing contracts with Government agencies under which proposed services would be considered within scope and might be procured, including contact information for the current Government contracting officers for such contracts.   <br> 4.   Respondents are also asked to identify if your business is Large, Non-profit, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business, or HUBZone Small Business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code (specify NAICS code here using: http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2007) with a size standard of (see size standards attached).   <br>  <br> WRITTEN RESPONSE <br>  <br> The Army requests that interested offerors submit an electronic response in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format in the form of a  quote mark white paper quote mark  of not more than ten (10) one-sided pages, 8.5 quote mark  x 11 quote mark  paper, 12 pitch font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.  Any charts and/or brochures will not be included as part of the ten (10) pages.  All responses must be unclassified.  Responsible sources having proven operational experience of similar scope as detailed above may submit their white paper, via e-mail to Amy J. Parker at amy.j.parker.civ@mail.mil no later than 4:00 PM (Eastern Time), 17 April 2015.  Responses received after this date and time will not be reviewed. <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The issuance of this Sources Sought Notice does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. CECOM, PEO IEW&S, INSCOM, and Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information properly marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for such. <br>  <br>

INTRODUCTION:  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a national presidential monument and living memorial, presents more than 2,000 performances each year to audiences totaling nearly 2 million.  The Center also hosts more than 1 million tourists each year.  Sited on 17 acres, the facility includes 1.5 million square feet of usable space, including four major theaters (Eisenhower Theater, Opera House, Concert Hall, and Terrace Theater), several smaller theaters and educational facilities (including the Family Theater, Theater Lab, and the twin Millennium Stages), rehearsal spaces, and meeting rooms, and a 1,971 - space parking garage.  The combined capacity of all the theater spaces totals over 7,200 seats.  There are two public restaurants, one staff cafeteria, nine special event rooms, and five public halls or galleries.  Three of the largest public halls or galleries contain interpretive exhibits, and the Grand Foyer-measuring six hundred feet long and sixty feet high-also contains a large bust of John F. Kennedy.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in total, uses thousands of light bulbs.

PURPOSE:  

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is continuously engaged in seeking more cost efficient, environmentally friendly technological solutions to its operational requirements to aid in the reduction of the public costs of operating and maintaining the monument.

<DESC>The US Government currently occupies 4,709 rentable square feet of office space in Fairfield, Idaho under a lease that will be expiring, for which there is a continuing need. While this space continues to meet our requirements, the Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous and will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements including telecommunications infrastructure costs and non-productive agency downtime. Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the lease and shall not be in a 100-year floodplain. The required lease term is 20 years, 15 years firm, pending a capital lease analysis, and must be available by December 1, 2015. Anyone with a location they would like the Government to consider must contact Brent Bailey at <a href="mailto:bbailey@fs.fed.us">bbailey@fs.fed.us</a> by April 21, 2015. This is only an inquiry as to availability of space for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Lease Proposal (RLP).

<p>Response Topics</p>
<p>Topic 1: In addition to receiving comments on the top level SOW, the Government is interested in obtaining information from industry concerning capabilities to meet the requirements of the SOW. In addition to your response to these specific topics, the Government requests that respondents complete the questionnaire in Attachment 1, based upon the requirements communicated in the SOW. This RFI is for market research and is not part of any down selection process.</p>
<p>Topic 2: The Government anticipates that this will be released under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330 Engineering and Technical Services. Under this classification, small business SBA 8(a) BD Program participant is identified as a business having less than $35.5M in annual revenues.

If your company is considered a large business, provide your subcontracting strategy of how you would best incorporate small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small business, veteran owned small business, and service disabled veteran owned small business, in the overall performance of this effort.</p>
<p>Topic 3: The Government has structured standard-based task areas to ensure that the current and future requirements are met over the term of the contract. These requirements, however, need to be tightly integrated. The Government wants to avoid stove-piped responses, and so is in favor of an integrated team to provide boundary-less support within the scope of the tasking, with only exceptions for some elements of network defense and security which need to be offset to ensure the integrity of those processes. Coincidentally, the Government wants a structured approach, with best of breed, standards based, repeatable processes and a strong program management office. Please comment on how the SOW could be structured to reinforce these desires.</p>

<p>The building is located at 150 Carlos E. Chardon Street which is on an existing 27 acre federal campus located in the Hato Rey area of San Juan.</p>
<p>The modernization of the Courthouse and Federal Office building, aspires to greatly improve the environmental impact of the facilities. These facilities were constructed in the early 1970s, and, aside from small retrofits, were still utilizing the original base building environmental systems. The existing system cooled the facilities using chilled water air-handling units served by a water-cooled chilled water plant located in the basement of the FOB. The chilled water plant rejects heat to cooling towers located on the roof of the FOB. In addition to this central plant, there is an auxiliary exterior, grade-mounted chilled water plant that provides additional cooling when necessary.</p>
<p>The facilities are located in the Hato Rey area of San Juan, Puerto Rico, which is a hot, humid environment. As a result, there is a continuous demand for cooling and dehumidification, particularly during the occupied daytime hours, and there is no demand for space heating. Improvements to the facilities have been implemented, including new window installations at the CH &amp; FOB, to reduce load and increase efficiency of the building systems.</p>
<p>In 2011 the high-performance green building modernization project began with the primary goal of reducing the annual energy consumption of the facilities and to further employ sustainable "green" strategies at the facilities therefore making healthier environments for their occupants. In this case, a healthier environment refers to greater thermal comfort, better indoor air quality, more comfortable lighting, and less toxic finishes (paints, floors, walls, ceilings, sealant, adhesives, etc.). To achieve this, the GSA committed to replacing all of the existing lighting and environmental systems with newer, more efficient, more effective systems.</p>
<p>As originally designed the project was to, at minimum, comply with the 2009 International Codes (including Mechanical, Energy, and Plumbing, among others), and achieve Silver Certification in accordance with LEED-NCv3.0. The original HPGB project outlined above has been completed generally through its second phase, including the complete upgrade of the chiller plant, replacement of the majority of the power distribution and substations, the installation of new roof and a solar photovoltaic system at the FOB and HVAC, lighting and ceiling upgrades to roughly 50% of the tenant the areas in the FOB and CH building. The project described by this document seeks to complete the intent of this project as close as possible to the original design intent as a "follow-on" comprising the unfinished portions of the both buildings per the original design documents for the HPGB, plus bid options for the extension to the Link Entry Building, upgrade of the Nazario Lobby HVAC and additional work items in the FOB.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the release of a Request for Proposals (RFP's) for the technical portion of this procurement on or about June 30, 2015. The RFP will be issued via the FedBizOpps internet site at: https://www.fbo.gov .

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 3:00PM on April 23, 2015. <br>  <br>  <br> Summary of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> The work described herein involves the replacement/upgrade of the navigation lock downstream gate hoist mechanical machinery and the associated electrical and control equipment, and the rehabilitation of the gate hoist friction sheaves.     <br>  <br> Background <br>  <br> The Lower Monumental navigation lock downstream gate is a counterbalanced vertical lift gate and measures approximately 84 feet tall by 88 feet wide and weighs approximately 690 tons.  The gate is connected to two counterweights (one on each side) with twelve 2-1/4 quote mark  diameter wire ropes.  The hoist machinery is located in two machinery rooms located at the top of the downstream structural towers, one on each side of the lift gate.  The wire ropes pass over an 18 foot diameter friction sheave.  The friction sheave is driven through an electric hydraulic pump driving a high speed hydraulic motor.  The speed is reduced and torque increased through a gearbox having an external pinion driving the gear around the perimeter of the sheave.  The wire rope passes over the uppermost surface of the hoist sheave.  The two hoist sheaves support the cumulative weight of the gate, the counterweight, and the hoist ropes.   <br>  <br> The downstream lift gate hoist machinery is the original machinery installed when the lock was placed into service in 1969, with the exception of the hydraulic power units (replaced in 1989) and the gear boxes (replaced with reconditioned gear boxes in 2011).  Electrical and control systems are original.   <br>  <br> Summary of Work <br>  <br> Mechanical upgrades consist of the hoist drive components required to operate the gate, the overhead service crane in each machinery room, and the mechanical aspects of limits and controls for gate operation. <br>  <br> Furnish and install the following items for the hoist drives in each machinery room:  new pinion gears, pinion shafts, pinion bearings, couplings, and brakes. In addition, install new Government-furnished gearboxes.        <br>  <br> Install new bearings for the friction sheaves in each machinery room. In order to replace the friction sheave bearings, the contractor must have technical experience, labor, and physical plant required for jacking and shoring of the existing 18 foot diameter friction sheaves that weigh approximately 112,000 pounds each.  Upon completion of the bearing replacement, the contractor will be responsible for precise alignment of the friction sheave bearings and the alignment of open gear contact between the new pinion gears and the existing friction sheave ring gears.    <br>  <br> The contractor will be responsible for gate hoist wire rope load balancing that will require the services of a qualified engineer with a minimum of three years experience with load cells and load monitoring equipment to ensure the loads are evenly distributed across all hoist wire ropes at the completion of the work. <br>  <br> The overhead service cranes in each machinery room will be replaced with commercially-available five ton rated electric wire rope hoists.  New overhead cranes shall be single-girder top running bridge-type furnished with pendant style pushbutton remote control and wall-mounted pushbutton control station.  <br>  <br> Structural upgrades consist of rehabilitation and weld repair of the downstream gate hoist friction sheaves, fabrication and installation of new machinery supports and pedestals, fabrication and installation of new work platforms, gratings, handrails, guardrails, ladders, and ladder cages, and structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels.   <br>  <br> All weld repair performed on the gate hoist friction sheaves must conform to American Welding Society (AWS) D1.5 - Bridge Welding Code requirements.  Accordingly, contractor welders shall pass the qualification tests prescribed by AWS D1.5 prior to performing work on this contract.  Develop welding procedures in accordance with AWS D1.5 and provide the services of AWS D1.5 certified welding inspectors to conduct required non-destructive testing of new and repaired welds on the gate hoist friction sheaves. <br>  <br> Structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels consist of the installation of an adhesive anchor system to increase the load capacity of the corbels from 5,000 pounds to 7,000 pounds.  Evaluate concrete drilling locations for the presence of existing reinforcing steel with Ground Penetrating Radar or an approved equivalent method. <br>  <br> Electrical upgrades consist of replacement of the machinery room motor control centers and power supply wiring and circuit breakers, installation of new variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped motors, new main power disconnects, new power distribution blocks, new VFD's, new control voltage transformers, new dynamic brake resistors, new programmable logic controllers (PLC), new network switches, new fiber optic panels, and new control relays. <br>  <br> New PLC installations require the contractor to provide PLC program development, licensed software packages, shop testing, and operator field tests.  New VFD installations require specified hardware, programming software, onsite installation supervision by the VFD manufacturer, VFD test plans, and execution of performance verification tests. <br>  <br> New control panel, graphic panel, and equipment panel installations require specified hardware to be verified through Government-witnessed shop testing prior to delivery to the work site. <br>  <br> A critical element of the project involves complex sequencing and coordination of commissioning and cut-over of new equipment and systems, and highly technical interfaces between new and old systems.  The Contractor must demonstrate experience and qualifications necessary to manage challenging Quality Control and Commissioning programs for both factory and on-site testing requirements.  The project involves the procurement of complex electrical and control equipment with long lead times.  Complete on-site work in close coordination with the Government lock and dam facility, and minimize outages and disruptions to operations.  <br>  <br> Provide on-site customer operations and maintenance training by authorized representatives of the new equipment manufacturers.  <br>  <br> Miscellaneous elements of the contract include RCRA 8 metal based paint and asbestos containing material (ACM) removal and disposal from existing equipment.            <br>     <br> Complete all work at the navigation lock within a finite work window of 12 weeks between December 2016 and March 2017.  Work must be completed within the specified work window in order to return the navigation lock to service in accordance with a coordinated Columbia/Snake River navigation system outage plan.

Offerors not responding to this RFI will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation.  When the solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of any potential Offeror to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <br>  <br> 8.  Background:  USAISR is part of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC).  The USAISR is dedicated to both laboratory and clinical trauma research.  Its mission is to provide requirements - driven combat casualty care medical solutions and products for injured soldiers from self-aid through definitive care cross the full spectrum of military operations; provide state-of -the art trauma, burn, and critical care to Department of Defense beneficiaries around the world; and provide Burn Special Medical Augmentation Response Teams.  <br>  <br> 9.  Scope  and Purpose:   <br> The University/Company shall support the USAISR in development of evidence-based checklist for en-route care. Under conditions simulating Role I-Role II/III transport in healthy subjects describe skin interface pressure and transcutaneous oxygen (tcPO2) over bony prominences (sacrum and heel) that are high risk for pressure ulcer development. The specific aim of the study is develop innovative strategies that can be immediately implemented to alleviate the risk of pressure ulcer development in this austere environment. <br> 9.1.  Subjects will be positioned, supine or supine with 30 degree backrest, on the NATO litter with standard aeromedical evacuation mattress and multiple physiological parameters will be recorded along with the collection of subject demographic information. <br> Skin Interface Pressure - is the pressure at the interface between a bony prominence, the overlaying skin, and a support surface is called the interface pressure. Peak interface pressure, which is the highest measured pressure for each body region will be measured using a specialized mattress system that is placed between the subject and the mattress.  <br> Transcutaneous oxygen (tcPO2) - transcutaneous oximetry measures oxygenation under loaded and unloaded conditions and will be the method to measure ischemia.  <br> Demographic information - height, weight, calculated BMI <br> 9.2.  Environment conditions will be normalized to control for the effect of ambient temperature cutaneous blood flow.  The ambient temperature of a controlled exercise lab will be adjusted to 70-73 F. <br> 9.3. Fifteen healthy volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 55 will be enrolled to meet the stratification scheme. Males   and females will be included. Subjects will have weight and height measurements as well as body frame size determination obtained. Height and weight are measured using a standard up-right scale. Body frame size measurement is accomplished by using a standard caliper over the elbow. Subjects will be asked to lie on the NATO litter with mattress in two different positions. (Total time on litter 2 hours.) Skin interface pressures will be obtained non-invasively using a thin sensor mat placed between the subject's body and the support surface. The interface pressure mat uses extremely low voltage current and is electrically grounded. In addition tcPO2 electrodes will be placed on the sacrum, heels, and occiput to measure pressure and tissues oxygenation. <br> 9.4. Statistical Plan - This analysis will allow us to inform future research by describing individual variability in physiological parameters over time, to identify appropriate periods for analysis (i.e., can we obtain reliable and valid data with a 20 test period compared to a 45 minute test period) and the feasibility of the methods (i.e., can an individual lie motionless for 45 minutes) <br> For each individual by area and tcPO2 electrode, descriptive statistics will be used to describe skin interface pressure and tcPO2 over time. <br> For each individual, by body area, descriptive plots of interface pressure and tcPO2 over time will be generated. Time series analysis will be conducted to describe within and across person variability in tcPO2 over time. <br> To address the primary hypothesis of this study, a linear mixed model will be used. For this analysis, the data will be collapsed to five minute intervals. For each individual, time and location (sacrum, heels, and occiput) will be analyzed separately with pressure as a covariate. For the sacrum and heels the tcPO2 will be the outcome variable. This analysis will allow for evaluation of the main effect (pressure- tcPO2), time (trend in pressure and tcPO2 over time) and the interaction between pressure and time on tissue oxygenation (tcPO2). This method of analysis has been previously used in a similar study evaluating pressure and tcPO2 in healthy subjects in supine position on a hospital bed and seated positions (wheelchair). <br> Qualitative information to evaluate the feasibility of the design in terms of subject comfort and ability to remain motionless will also be analyzed. A graphical exploration of differences in tcPO2 patterns between subjects who did and did not move during a given study period will be shown. <br> 9.5. Final Report - Final report analyzing differences in skin interface pressure, and indicators of tissue perfusion (transcutaneous oxygen and skin temperature) under baseline conditions. These results will inform the design of intervention trials to evaluate strategies to mitigate risk factors for pressure ulcer development <br>  <br> 10.  Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A Draft PWS dated 13 April 2015, Version 1 (Attachment A) is included with this RFI for informational purposes and identifies the scope of work.  The final PWS will be released with the solicitation.  <br>  <br> 11. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) - or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will NOT be returned.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification. 

NAICS Code(s):
541330 - Engineering Services
541370- Construction surveying services
541513- Computer Facilities Management Services
541512- Computer Systems Design Services


The VA is seeking a solution to model facility and water systems, throughout the US at VHA locations, using Building Information Management (BIM) modeling and associated services to provide accurate, timely, up-to-date spatial layout information and water systems.  The models shall provide accurate information for use during facility trouble shooting, emergency preparedness and renovations. The models shall have the ability to be enhanced over time to include additional levels of development and building systems.

Included in the VA's requirement is the verification of existing documents (paper drawings, electronic CAD drawings and in some cases Revit models) with the actual layout and configuration of the building and the water systems.  This data would then be used to develop a BIM model of VHA facilities.  All resulting BIM models and associated data must be able to be stored, and managed in a repository and must be able to generate CAD drawings with secure access from anywhere in the VA.

The repository shall be an enterprise-wide solution to centrally access, manage, update and control these drawings to include the database management services to accomplish this task.  Currently all sites do not have staff or computer infrastructure to facilitate BIM models; therefore, part of the solution will be to address these deficiencies.


Interested Contractors are requested to provide feedback to the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), and to respond to the questions in the posted attachments.

1)	To enhance the VA's understanding of Building Information Modeling, please provide responses to questions posed in the attachment, ATTACHMENT 1 - BIM/CADD Questions.docx.

2)	Complete the Vendor Survey, ATTACHMENT 2 - BIM/CADD RFI SURVEY.XLS.

a.	Org Information - Provide general information on your organization (i.e. name, address, email, etc.)

b.	Service Info - Provide the applicable NAICS for the service(s) your organization can perform which is attributed to your company's socio-economic category. Also, provide any GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Information or other existing contracts that can be used. 

c.	Labor Categories & Price Estimate - Provide recommended labor categories, rates and hours for the services your company can provide.


Provide as much information as possible as well as any questions/recommendations you may have. Responses must be received by this office on or before 4:30 PM EST on April 24, 2015. Submit all responses to Blake McIlvane at blake.mcilvane@va.gov.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) for Blended Adaptive Language &amp; Culture Training" Symposium</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Number</strong>: GGW033020151055</p>
<p><strong>Notice Type:</strong> Market Research</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, maintaining our Nation's global security interests requires a military force that is able to successfully communicate and interact with a wide range of cultures - in their native language. To meet this challenge the Department of Defense (DoD) must identify and develop new and innovative training approaches to make language and culture training more effective, more accessible, and more relevant. The challenge of teaching language and culture is not solely relegated to the DoD. Federal Agencies, like the Department of Education (DoEd), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of State (DoS), among others, are focused on the challenges of understanding how to better teach language and culture and on how to benefit from the most cutting edge language and culture training technologies. As an indicator of just how cross-cutting this problem is, the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy's National Science and Technology Council Committee on Science chartered the Interagency Working Group on Language and Communication to explore, document, and foster collaboration between the research communities across the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Blended learning, which combines instructional technologies with classroom instruction, is one of the most promising approaches to satisfying the language and culture training challenge. The Department of Defense is now investing significant resources to blend adaptive training technologies with classroom instruction to make language training more accessible and more effective for each student. To better understand how to do this, the Defense Language and National Security Education Office (DLNSEO), in collaboration with the Human Performance, Training, and BioSystems Directorate, and Human Systems Community of Interest (HS COI), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, is hosting a two-day Symposium to help identify key issues, challenges, and solutions for developing and integrating adaptive language training technologies into the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Security Classification</strong>: Unclassified.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description</strong>: The "Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) for Blended Adaptive Language &amp; Culture Training" Symposium will be conducted at the Executive Conference Center (4075 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203) on 11-12 May, 2015. The main focus of the Symposium is:</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding the S&amp;T challenges and opportunities associated with creating better, more effective blended and adaptive language and culture training in more efficient ways to maximize the return on training investment.<br />Topics to be covered include:</p>
<p>&bull; State-of-the-art and outstanding challenges underlying blended learning</p>
<p>&bull; State-of-the-art and outstanding challenges underlying adaptive training</p>
<p>&bull; Opportunities and challenges for delivering blended, adaptive language &amp; culture training <br /><br />The format for the Symposium will feature keynote speakers, panel discussions that map onto the three areas listed above, breakout/brainstorming sessions, and opportunities to demonstrate new technologies and research. The outcome from this Symposium will be: (1) a draft roadmap that will address the next stages of Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) research needed to develop and integrate adaptive training technology into the classroom; and (2) an edited book, to help capture the scope of activities in which Symposium participants are engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Participants:</strong> Symposium attendance is limited and will be by-invitation only. Symposium attendees will include representatives of government, industry, and academia. Those wishing to attend are asked to submit an abstract (no longer than one page) that summarizes their efforts and interests in Blended Learning; Adaptive Training; Language and Culture Training; or other areas relevant to the Symposium's topics and focus. There are a number of opportunities for participation throughout the event. Discussion is highly encouraged during and after the Keynote Addresses and the special Panel Sessions on Day 1. Additionally, Day 2 of the Symposium offers an opportunity for all participants to share their expertise with others in the field during constructive breakout sessions focused on developing a strategy for the future of blended learning, adaptive training, and, in particular, delivering blended, adaptive language &amp; culture training.</p>
<p>&bull; There are a limited number of panelist positions available. If you are interested in participating as a panelist, please include a supplement to your abstract submission that describes: (1) on which panel you are interested in sitting, and (2) what topics you would like to cover as a panelist.</p>
<p>&bull; There are a limited number of spaces available for standard poster presentations. If you are interested in having a poster showcased during the symposium, please include a supplement to your abstract submission that describes the poster content.</p>
<p>&bull; There are a limited number of spaces available for technology demonstrations. If you are interested in showcasing a relevant technology please include a supplement to your abstract submission that describes: (1) the technology and its relevance to the Symposium; (2) size, power and related requirements.</p>
<p><br />Abstracts are due by 1200 EDT 23 April, 2015. Abstracts will be reviewed by the Symposium's Interagency Executive Steering Committee, and both selected and non-selected submitters, as well as panelists, will be notified by event POCs by 1700 EDT 24 April, 2015. To submit abstracts go to: http://www.sa-meetings.com/HPTBtrainingmay2015. Login: "Blended Adaptive"; Password: "May_2015". <br />Cost reimbursement will not be provided for Symposium attendance.

<CONTACT>Kristen Kachur, 973-724-3217

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Department of Assistant Secretary Army Acquisition Logistics and Technology (ASAALT) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties about the Government's interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support Department of the Army Cyberspace Operations requirements as related to weapons or weapon systems.  <br>  <br> The ASAALT develops, acquires, fields, and sustains the world's best equipment and services through efficient leveraging of technologies and capabilities to meet current and future Army needs.  The ASAALT is seeking to leverage multiple vehicles as a holistic approach for effective and efficient execution of Army Cyberspace capability development.  Additional information about ASAALT is available at http://www.army.mil/asaalt. <br>  <br> The Government is anticipating establishing a Section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with a new or existing consortium that has significant non-traditional contractor participants.  The goal of this consortium community is to assist in maturing Army Cyberspace Operations through re-use and augmenting existing cyber technologies and fostering relevant cyber weapons systems and awareness in the newly established Cyber domain.  Cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers (JP 1-02).  Maturing the Army Cyberspace domain requires an effective understanding of the technology landscape as it relates to current and future cyberspace capability needs.  <br>  <br> The mission of the consortium will be to establish the Army as a leader in cyberspace operations, capability development, R&D, education and training programs, and policy development. Additional goals will include:  <br>  <br>  - Be a thought and action leader across the cyberspace operations stakeholder community  <br>  - Serve as proof-of-concept test bed and blueprint for requirements articulation and capability development <br>  - Facilitate the advancement of membership cyber maturity levels (as this domain knowledge grows the probability of warfighter technological advantage increases) <br>  - Create a cyber center of gravity as incubator and engine for a cyberspace capability <br>  - Shape and enable cyberspace operations education <br>  <br> Section 845(a)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. In accordance with the above referenced law, the Government must ensure that no official of an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for a prototype project under this authority unless there is significant non-traditional defense contractor(s) participation in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.  <br>  <br> In addition to existing consortiums, industry members may propose forming a new consortium that would seek to work with the Government, through an OTA agreement in the below areas. Any company, university, or research organization is eligible to join the consortium. The Government is seeking interested parties that are willing to join and/or establish a consortium with collective expertise in the following technology areas specifically related to Army Cyberspace Operations: <br>  <br> Cyberspace Operations Technology Objectives:  <br>  <br> Innovative technologies, processes, methods, facilities and capabilities are sought to identify, develop, test, provide access to, and improve technologies resident in universities, private and federal labs, incubators and industry that are focused on Army Cyberspace requirements (offensive, defensive, and DoDIN) related to weapons and weapons-systems. At all levels, the Army seeks to build, operate, and secure defensible networks, defending them against specific threats to achieve mission assurance, while denying the adversary freedom of action in the cyberspace domain. <br>  <br> Offensive Cyberspace Operations Objectives - Technologies to supporting operations to project power by the application of force against enemies and adversaries in and through cyberspace. <br>  <br>  - Technologies for Cyber situational awareness and integration with offensive operations. <br>  - Technologies for delivery of denial effects in cyberspace. <br>  - Technologies for planning and management of integrated cyberspace and electronic warfare tools. <br>  <br> Defensive Cyberspace Operations Objectives - Technologies supporting operations conducted to defend DOD or other friendly cyberspace and preserve the ability to utilize friendly cyberspace capabilities. <br>  <br>  - Technologies to gain and maintain situational awareness through the visualization of key cyber terrain and an understanding of the actions occurring within. <br>  - Technologies that actively predict and hunt (search and discover) for advanced internal cyber threats and vulnerabilities that do not trigger or generate warnings using routine detection measures.  <br>  - Technologies that allow friendly cyber forces to outmaneuver adversaries by performing preapproved, automated, agile, internal countermeasures that stop or mitigate cyber attacks; and when authorized, conduct  response actions external to friendly networks in order to create effects that deny the adversary use of offensive cyber capabilities.   <br>  - Technologies to conduct DCO mission planning and protection that identifies and assures the availability of key cyber terrain and critical infrastructure to the Army, DoD, host nation, and civil authorities that support Army missions.  <br>  - Technologies that protect networks, information technology platforms, and data by controlling inbound/outbound traffic, dynamically managing locations of critical services, and hardening information systems.   <br>  - Technologies to conduct mission assurance actions that dynamically re-establish, re-secure, re-route, reconstitute, or isolate degraded or compromised networks.   <br>  - Technologies to conduct site exploitation and forensic analysis and determine technical and operational impacts of intrusions.   <br>  - Technologies to evaluate the defensive posture of networks and information systems using vulnerability assessment methods and threat emulation in order to recommend or direct changes to ensure operational readiness.  <br>  <br> DoDIN Operations Objectives - Technologies supporting operations to design, build, configure, secure, operate, maintain, and sustain networks.  <br>  <br>  - Technologies to build (plan, engineer, install) secure, resilient, and defensible networks  <br>  - Technologies that supports global, secure, adaptive, and rapid access across trusted and authenticated domains to authorized entities. <br>  - Technologies that allow for the secure operation of networks. (i.e. automated scanning and remediation of vulnerabilities) <br>  - Technologies that support the integration with mission partners during garrison and deployed operations. <br>  - Technologies that support the discovery, delivery, and storage of data to provide awareness and access to information in a timely and efficient manner. <br>  <br> An Industry Day is planned for Thursday, 28 May 2015 in McLean, Virginia which will provide Industry/Academia the opportunity to obtain further details and engage in discussion on Government requirements with the Government sponsors. Details of the Industry Day will be provided in a forthcoming notice, which will highlight Army requirements, expected funding profiles, and the framework of a follow on Cyber Innovation Challenge event, which will focus on addressing specific DCO requirements.  This Industry Day will serve as an initial opportunity for interested members of industry and academia to meet and discuss details with key Army stakeholders, Army Cyber, TRADOC Cyber Center of Excellence (CoE), ASAALT Program Executive Offices (PEOs). Advance information can be obtained by contacting Mr. Larry Jennings at larry.l.jennings8.ctr@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> After the execution of the Industry Day, the Government anticipates responses to this announcement from interested parties, with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include; industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support Army Cyberspace Operations.

This is not a request for competitive proposals and is announced for the purpose of compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the justification follows:
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Modification of contract P14PC00411 for additional within scope work.</p>
<p>3. A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, addresses electrical and plumbing upgrades resulting in improved visitor experience, improved operational efficiency, and unexpected contingencies occurring during contract performance. Proposed actions include upgraded flush valves, additional track lighting, replace rotten rafters, install new two inch domestic water line, provide new urinals with automated flush valves, demo ceiling and related, install new concrete water vault, fiberglass panels in mechanical room, install remote annunciator panel, install three new electrical panels, replace light fixtures, add extra power for data and exhibits. Net increase $55,246 (original award $1,145,293).</p>
<p>4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: NPS COTI 1443.06-02,&nbsp;and FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This was a competitive project that was properly synopsized and awarded. TCC-NLC JV was selected as the Best Value in accordance with the solicitation requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Contractor has performed quality work throughout the duration of the project and has completed construction per the construction documents (drawings and specifications). The contractor is presently actively mobilized and working at the Hoh Visitor Center which is located in a very remote part of Washington State and within a Rain Forest. Many of the identified changes will need to be performed during construction as it would not be possible or practical to stop work. The Government has requested and agreed upon a fair and reasonable price to perform the additional within scope requirements. It would be significantly more expensive to mobilize and demobilize new personnel and equipment needed to make the changes identified herein if this were part of a separate contract.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: The Notice of Intent modification will be properly synopsized.</p>
<p>7. A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Pricing for the additional work has been reviewed by the Program Manager and the Contracting Officer, documentation is on file.</p>
<p>8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market Research was conducted for the original contract. This added work is directly related to the original scope of work, it would not be practical to try and obtain a second contractor to do a small part of the additional work required.</p>
<p>9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A</p>
<p>10. A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A</p>
<p>11. A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: N/A, based upon the facts stated above.</p>
<p>12. Certification: I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:</p>
<p>Required signatures pending final review and approval. Fully approved documents will be maintained on file at North Cascades Procurement Office.</p>

<SUBJECT>H--LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data Processing
<SOLNBR>P15PS00893
<CONTACT>Lewis, David
<DESC>Giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are unique to the Sierra Nevada, where most sequoia groves are federally managed. In the southern Sierra Nevada, 68 giant sequoia groves stretch across three jurisdictions, including Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SEKI), Sequoia National Forest (SNF), and Giant Sequoia National Monument (GSNM).

While giant sequoias are difficult to study, much of what we understand about them has come out of these groves. Giant sequoias are a unique and significant part of the natural heritage of the region, the country, and the world, yet their existence may be threatened by climate change.

Scope of Work is to collect and analyze high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data to map the severity of drought effects on mature giant sequoia trees, assess confidence in the results using available ground data, and evaluate next steps to improve methodology and expand the study area. Collect high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery of giant sequoia groves during drought conditions. Timing of the study will be negotiated based on when the trees are likely to be most stressed and when the flights can logistically occur. Data collection for the two study areas totaling 145,808 acres (58,323 ha) will occur for 4 days. Total coverage will ultimately be based on weather during the 4 days of data collection. During this time period, all attempts to collect high quality, cloud free data will be made.

Data collection will be undertaken using an appropriate aircraft outfitted with a sensor package comprised of a high-fidelity Visible-to-Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer, a high-resolution multi-pulse waveform LiDAR scanner, and an embedded high resolution Global Positioning System-Inertial Measurement Unit (GPS-IMU). The VSWIR records data for the 400-2500 nm wavelength region in 5 nm bands, which are later processed to 10 nm spectral data. The data will be collected from 2000 m above ground level (a.g.l.), yielding a nominal spatial resolution (ground sampling distance) of 2.0 m for hyperspectral and 1.1 m for LiDAR data. With 50% overlap between adjacent flightlines, the nominal laser spot spacing averages 4 shots per square meter.

Following each data collection day, data will be downloaded and quality checks will be conducted on both the LiDAR and spectral data. All raw data will be transferred to a secure computer archive. 

Interested parties to this Sources Sought must submit their capabilities statement along with documented past experience of similar sized projects no later than 3pm (1500) PST on April 17, 2015. Submit documentation electronically to david_lewis@nps.gov

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action Code:</span> Intent 2015-1 SPXAV</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agency:</span> Department of Health and Human Services<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Office:</span> Office of the Secretary<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location:</span> Acquisitions Management, Contracts, &amp; Grants (AMCG)<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contracting Office Address:</span><br />Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response (ASPR)<br />Department of Health and Human Services<br />330 Independence Ave. SW<br />G640<br />Washington, District of Columbia 20201<br />United States</p>
<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) intends to use other than full and open competition to award a sole source contract to Chimerix, Inc. for procurement of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract will be posted for 15 calendar days to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government requirements. The Government seeks to avoid substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This 15 calendar day notice shall expire on April 28, 2015 at 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. If no credible responses to the intent to sole source are received by the Government, a request for proposal will be forwarded to Chimerix, Inc. Following, the Government will amend the intent to sole source by posting the redacted Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for 30 days. The proposed contract action will support services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested individuals may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting in writing their name, address, telephone number, email, and a statement regarding capability to provide the specified smallpox antiviral. Responses shall be limited to three (3) pages or less, including all attachments. Interested parties will be considered only if they respond to this notice with clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government, would not be cost or time prohibitive, and would not hinder the mission objective of delivering a second readily-available smallpox antiviral to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Strategic National Stockpile (CDC/SNS) with a mechanism of action that differs from the smallpox antiviral already in the CDC/SNS, ST-246. All capability statements, proposals, or quotes received prior to April 28, 2015 at 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time will be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any capability statement, proposals, or quotes submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Award Date and Period of Performance:</span></p>
<p>The Government anticipates an award date of fourth quarter FY2015. The estimated period of performance for the 60-month base period is 9/1/2015 - 8/31/2020 for initial deliveries of the second smallpox antiviral treatment courses to the CDC/SNS. Options may be exercised at the Government's discretion to achieve the potential delivery of a maximum of 1.7 million treatment courses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery Schedule:</span></p>
<p>The delivery schedule of the smallpox antiviral treatment courses to the CDC/SNS for the treatment of smallpox will be established during contract negotiations. The first delivery of smallpox antiviral to the CDC/SNS fulfilling requirements established by the FDA to support potential use of the product during a declared emergency is expected to occur in calendar year 2017 of the 60 month base period. The remaining product deliveries will be structured during the remaining 60 month base period.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract type:</span></p>
<p>The Government proposes the award of a hybrid contract consisting of a firm-fixed price component for purchase of smallpox antiviral and a cost-plus fixed fee component to support final development efforts of the smallpox antiviral.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimated award amount:</span></p>
<p>The total estimated dollar value for the 60-month base period contract is approximately $100M. If all options are awarded, the total dollar value is estimated to be $435M.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>BARDA awarded an advanced research and development contract to Chimerix Inc. in February 2011 to support development and approval of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox as well as dsDNA virus infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV). Since that time, significant progress has been made. A data package to support NDA filing for the prevention of CMV is nearing completion. Most non-clinical studies as well as drug manufacturing activities that are required to support approval for both CMV and smallpox indications have been completed. The number of human subjects that have received brincidofovir has increased to more than 1,000 human patients including pediatrics. Therefore, the human safety dataset to support approval and use for both commercial and biodefense indications is robust. During this time, there has also been extensive communication between the FDA, Chimerix, and BARDA about a data package that could support approval of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox in accordance with the FDA Animal Rule. These discussions have informed the studies that have been completed to date to demonstrate safety and efficacy in animal models of orthopox infection.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:</span></p>
<p>The Government seeks a second smallpox antiviral for delivery to the CDC/SNS with a distinct mechanism of action from the current procurement and delivery of SIGA Technologies smallpox antiviral, ST-246. Procurement of a second smallpox antiviral for the CDC/SNS will achieve the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) smallpox preparedness goal of having two smallpox antivirals with distinct mechanisms of action readily available. The Chimerix smallpox antiviral, brincidofovir, targets orthopox viruses with a distinct mechanism of action when compared to ST-246. In the event of resistance to one smallpox antiviral or if one smallpox antiviral is contraindicated for an individual patient, a second smallpox antiviral option will be available. In addition, the Government desires a product in an advanced stage of development (Phase 2 clinical development or greater) with a commercial indication to enhance sustainability of the smallpox antiviral and potentially reduce total life cycle costs to the Government. The Government desires a smallpox antiviral that has demonstrated activity against variola virus in vitro, and has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of orthopox virus infection in at least one animal model deemed suitable through correspondence with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Finally, the Government seeks a smallpox antiviral with a robust human safety database in adults and children. Brincidofovir, currently being developed by Chimerix, Inc has been identified as the one candidate smallpox antiviral therapy that has the potential to meet all of the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>An understanding of the drug-specific approval pathway for smallpox and significant progress in achieving the milestones along that pathway are unique to Chimerix. The Government considers that an award to any other Offeror would be a duplication of effort and require funding to complete animal model studies and clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy of the product prior to procurement and FDA approval. In addition, this duplication of efforts would significantly delay the time to drug approval for a smallpox indication as well as readiness of the product for procurement and stockpiling.</p>

The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance period of this contract at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required below:  <br> Workmen's Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance $100,000.00  <br> General Liability Insurance for Bodily Injury Liability:  <br> Minimum Per Occurrence $500,000.00  <br> Automobile Liability Insurance:  <br> Minimum Per Person $200,000.00  <br> Minimum Per Occurrence for Bodily Injury $500,000.00  <br> Minimum Per Occurrence for Property Damage $ 20,000.00  <br> b. Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall certify to the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained.  The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective (1) for such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed or prescribed (2) until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor give written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.  <br> c. The Contractor shall insert the substance of the clause entitled Insurance - Work on a Government Installation (FAR 52.228-5), in subcontracts under this contract that requires work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required above. <br>  <br> Service Contract Act Wage Determination 05-2187, Revision 15, dated 22 December 2014, is applicable to this procurement.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  <br> Source selection for this procurement will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.602, Streamlined Evaluation of Quotations, and FAR Part 13.106-2, Evaluation of Quotations or quotations.  For a quoter's submission to be determined Technically Acceptable and receive consideration for award based upon lowest price submitted, the quotation must receive a rating of Acceptable for both Technical Acceptability and Past Performance.  The Government will award the contract to the quoter that meets all the evaluation criteria with a Acceptability rating, and has the lowest price.  Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors will not be permitted.  <br> As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the quoter's final option period price to the quoter's total price. Quoters are required only to price the base and option periods.  Quoters shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period.  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an quoter to be considered for award.  Those quoters not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  <br> In the event of an unacceptable Past Performance evaluation rating for an otherwise Technically Acceptable low price quoter, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event a quoter receives a rating of Unacceptable for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the quoter would remain Unacceptable based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.  <br> Discussions or Negotiations: The quoter's initial quotation should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final quotations will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial quotations.  <br> Award for All of the Work: The Government intends minimum of one (1) contract(s) as a result of this solicitation; however, the Government may make multiple awards.  Each Schedule will be evaluated separately and awarding the most advantageous quotation for each Schedule.  Schedule B includes CLINs 0002, 1002, 2002; Schedule C includes CLIN 0003, 1003, 2003.  Schedule D includes CLIN 0004, 1004, 2004.  Therefore, quoters may submit quotes for one, all or any combination of the Schedules.  When submitting an offer for a Schedule, quoters must complete the associated Price List for the Line Items associated with that Schedule in order to be considered for award.  An incomplete Price List may cause the Quoter to be considered ineligible for award of the corresponding Schedule/Line Items.  For example if an offer intends to submit a quote for Schedule B; the Bid Schedule and the Price Lists for CLINs 0001, 1001, and 2001 shall all be completed and submitted in their applicable sections. <br> Evaluation Criteria.  <br> (1) Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  Quotations will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:  <br> Factor I: Technical Capability  <br> 1. Acceptability Standard 1: Management Approach  <br> Factor II: Past Performance  <br> Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with a quoter's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance.  In evaluating Past Performance, Quality of Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated.  <br> Factor III: Price  <br>  <br> Factor I: Technical Acceptability: The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the quoter's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.  <br> Acceptability Standard 1: Management Approach - Must demonstrate a thorough knowledge and understanding of how to fulfill the Government's requirement through the illustration of management approach.  Approach shall include approach to scheduling, timely performance, ability to supervise and manage a team of people to include subcontractors, and a detailed execution plan showing labor hours, and equipment. <br> The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below. The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.  <br> Table 1.  Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings  <br> Rating Description  <br> Acceptable Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br> Unacceptable Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  <br> (2) Factor II: Past Performance: The quoter shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the quoter's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the quoter's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation.  Quoters are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the quoter's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  <br> There is no minimum or maximum number of references required; however, the quoter shall submit sufficient past performance information to demonstrate the depth and breadth to successfully satisfy all areas of the proposed effort.  It is incumbent upon the contractor to present the past performance information in such a manner and in sufficient detail to ensure the Government clearly understands the information provided.  <br> Each quoter will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Quoter's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.  <br> Recency Assessment: An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.  <br> Relevancy Assessment: To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the quoter's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the quoter, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of a quoter's contract history would give the most confidence that the quoter will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the quotation and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.  <br> The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.  <br> The Past Performance Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  <br> Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings  <br> Rating Description  <br> Acceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br> Quoters without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, Unknown shall be considered acceptable.  <br> (3) Factor III: Price: The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 13.106-2.  Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.  <br> Options.  Pricing submitted for the Quoter Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness. The Government will evaluate the Quoter's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the second option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for a quoter to be considered for award.  Those quoters not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the quoter whose quotation represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quotation.  <br> Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.  <br> Quotations are due no later than 27 April 2015, 4:00 PM CST.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by the agency.  In accordance with 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, paragraph (f), quotes received after the established closing date will be viewed as late, and therefore not considered.  Quotations may be submitted via email (preferred) to matthew.e.wernert.mil@mail.mil or via mail to MICC - Fort Campbell, ATTN: MAJ Matthew Wernert, 6923 38th and Desert Storm Ave, Fort Campbell, KY 42223-5355.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.<br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [_] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.<br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br />[_] TIN:_____________________.<br />[_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:<br />[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;<br />(4) Type of organization.<br />[_] Sole proprietorship;<br />[_] Partnership;<br />[_] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />[_] Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />[_] Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />[_] Foreign government;<br />[_] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />[_] Other ____________________.<br />(5) Common parent.<br />[_] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent:<br />[_] Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ____________________________________<br />TIN ______________________________________<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

This service is critical to keep the system operational at optimal performance for the mission of CBER's research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cell-based transfusion products, such as platelets and red cells. This microscope is unique because it is capable of intra vital microscopy to observe cellular interactions in living animals. CBER uses the microscope to track fluorescently labelled cells infused into mice and rats to observe normal and pathologic interactions between the infused cells and various organ systems such as the lung, liver, mesentery and peripheral circulation. CBER's research focus is on the contribution of damaged transfusion products on the development of acute lung injury and in potentiation of thrombotic reactions in healthy and diseased animals. The animal models developed through this microscope are used to explain and anticipate adverse events associated with transfusion of regulated products to patients. The microscope is routinely used by research groups in LCH and Laboratory of Plasma Derivatives (LPD). The last maintenance agreement for the equipment expired 06/10/2014.</p>

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Quotation Evaluation:</em> <br />The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to an Offeror whose quotation offers an integrated approach for meeting the requirements of the Statement of Work/Specifications and is evaluated as the best value for the Government, price and other non-price criteria considered. This evaluation may result in an award to a higher-priced Offeror where the decision is consistent with the evaluation criteria and represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability, 2) Past <br />Performance, 3) Schedule and 4) Price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance. The non-price criteria when combined are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />1. Technical Capability (non-price)<br />Offerors' technical quotation will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror provides a sound, compliant product and/or approach that meets the requirements of the Government's Statement of Work/Specifications (attached). In doing so, Offerors shall demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the requirements in the Technical Quotation. Offerors' quotation shall detail their technical capability to accomplish the requirements in section 3 of the Statement of Work/Specifications. <br /><br />2. Past Performance (non-price)<br />The evaluation of past performance information will consider the extent to which Offerors' past performance demonstrates the capability and capacity to provide products and services within the scope of the Statement of Work/Specifications. The term "Offeror" here is defined as the prime contractor and any of its primary subcontractors. The Government may also use data obtained from other sources. Offeror's without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will neither be evaluated favorably nor unfavorably on Past Performance, and will be assigned a Neutral rating.</p>
<p>The Quotation will be assessed to determine the extent to which:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. The relevant past and present work of the Offeror or teaming partners demonstrate successful accomplishments of projects similar in size, scope and complexity to the SOW requirements.<br /><br />b. Offerors' past performance are found to be within an acceptable range to ensure minimal risk and high confidence in the Offeror's capability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors' or teaming partners - involvement) to successfully accomplishing the services described in the SOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by Offerors in their quotation, as well as data obtained from other sources.<br /><br />3. Schedule (non-price)<br />Evaluation of Schedule will consider Offerors' ability to meet milestone schedule of projects similar in size, scope and complexity to the SOW requirements.<br /><br />4.

Please provide all submissions to Government Point of Contact: Shayna Connery, (619) 556-5989, shayna.connery @navy.mil.<br />All offerors must comply with the requirements listed above for this request. Failure to comply may result in disqualification. This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be an unreasonably high or low price. Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all proposals. Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors.<br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION:<br />Offerors shall address the following two factors:<br />1. Factor 1 - Technical Capability - Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to meet the requirements of statement of work and the CLINs.<br />2. Factor 2 - Price - The offeror shall complete and submit a firm fixed price for each CLINs and a grand total for CLINs 0001-0005. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing on page one (1), the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the Contracting Officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offeror's prices.<br />DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br />AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows:<br />(1) Step One - Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability proposals received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable. If any factor is rated "unacceptable", the entire proposal is rendered technically unacceptable, and the proposal will be removed from the competitive range. Only proposals deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table.<br />Rating Description:<br />Acceptable proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those proposals determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical proposals are considered to be equal.<br />Unacceptable proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Proposals with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award.<br />(2) Step Two - Evaluate Price. The offeror's price will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price of CLIN 0001-0005 proposed as annotated under Factor 2 - Price. FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990) applies.<br />(3) Step Three - Award Decision. An award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offeror's proposal to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.<br />DISCLAIMER: This is a request for the submission of a proposal and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offeror's submission of a proposal constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work.<br />Please provide the following:<br />1. Company Name and Address<br />2. Company Point of Contact <br />3. Company Telephone <br />4. Company Facsimile <br />5. Company Email Address<br />APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:<br />Offers received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 shall be considered non-compliant. Lack of registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database will make an offeror ineligible for award.<br />The FAR requires the use of the System for Award Management (SAM) in Federal solicitations as a part of the offer submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3. More information on SAM is found at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI launched the C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire Transition Initiative (CITI) program in September 2011, four months after the end of post-election violence. The contested presidential election of November 28, 2010 was a part of the 2007 Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which outlined steps towards reunifying the country which had been divided between a government-controlled south and a rebel-controlled north. Instead of ensuring C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire's transition to a stable and democratic country, the contested elections provoked violence and resulted in three thousand people losing their lives, hundreds of thousands being displaced, and an already tense social and political environment throughout the region becoming more inflamed.</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made towards economic recovery and political stability since the 2011 electoral crisis. Since assuming the presidency in May 2011, Alassane Ouattara has promoted economic growth, extended state authority and services across the country, and overseen relatively peaceful legislative and local elections in 2012 and 2013, respectively. However, the underlying causes of the crisis have only been partially addressed, allowing community divisions to deepen and political tensions to simmer. Since 1990, elections have been major sources of instability and violence in Cote d'Ivoire. The Presidential elections in 2015 could emerge as an incendiary flashpoint, bringing to the fore unresolved issues such as nationality/citizenship, ethnicity, land tenure and impunity that were at the heart of the crisis and remain impediments to a successful post transition period. There is concern that these issues could be exploited particularly at the community level to disrupt the electoral process, undermine the gains made during the recovery period, and impede progress towards consolidating and achieving additional political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Given these issues, the second phase of OTI's Cote d'Ivoire Transition Initiatives (CITI) program, CITI 2, focuses on increasing community cohesion and resilience and providing support to the 2015 electoral process with a view towards local-level issues. Taking advantage of key partnerships with local government institutions and non-governmental organizations, and utilizing OTI's ability to rapidly design and implement activities through its small-grant mechanism, CITI 2 concentrates on grassroots solutions to potential flashpoint issues while continuing to strengthen relationships across and within communities. OTI's programming aims to increase voter access to information and participation in the elections, with the overall goal to further consolidate social cohesion and political stability through an inclusive and credible electoral process.<br />The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Africa Regional Team and will be based in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire along with the OTI Country Representative. The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is supporting the Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire country program. Working closely with the implementing partner staff, the Deputy Country Representative assists in the design and development of grant activities, program implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions including budget preparation, financial management, records management, and travel assistance, to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the OTI Country Representative to develop an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the U.S. Embassy, bilateral donors, United Nations organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br /><strong>FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</strong></p>
<p>As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:</p>
<p>EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL</p>
<p>Technical is approximately equal to price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s) For evaluation purposes of the pricing for CLINS 52.217-8, see paragraph E below.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, "EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</strong></p>
<p>A. This acquisition will utilize a LPTA approach, in which the Government intends to award to an offeror with a technically acceptable l proposal and the lowest overall total evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />The LPTA approach does not permit tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>B. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions; however, discussions may be conducted with all, some, or none of the offerors. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.</p>
<p>C. The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>D. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.</p>
<p>E. Price Evaluation. Each offerors' price submitted in the Offer Schedule will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price = (Total Evaluated Price for Base Period) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 1) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 2) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 3) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 4) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option to Extend Services IAW FAR 52.217-8). Total Evaluated Price for Base Period Option Periods 1 through 4: Quantities identified will be multiplied by the unit price to confirm the extended price and then the extended price for all CLINS will be added together for a total for that specific period. Unit prices shall be used in the event that extended prices are calculated incorrectly.</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price for Option to Extend Services IAW FAR 52.217-8: Offerors shall not submit pricing for the Option to Extend Services CLINS. The Total Evaluated Price for Option to Extend Services IAW FAR 52.217-8 will be calculated by multiplying a quantity of 6 months by the unit prices proposed at Option Period 4. The prices are evaluated in the Total Evaluated Price for evaluation purposes only. The Option to Extend Services is not considered part of the contract period of performance and resultantly these totals shall not be included in the contract, however the CLINS will be added as information only. If the government exercises FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, the extension will not exceed 6 months total and the information only CLINS will be changed to priced CLINS at a monthly price equal to the preceding period of performance's most current monthly price.</p>
<p>F. Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information.</p>
<p>The Technical factor will receive an overall rating of either "Acceptable," or "Unacceptable" using the rating and descriptions in Table 1 below: The Government's technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning one of the ratings described below for each subfactor. Any subfactor evaluated as "Unacceptable" will render the entire proposal unacceptable and, therefore, un-awardable. Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. However, the offeror is cautioned that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion.</p>
<p><br />Table 1. Technical Ratings <br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:</p>
<p><strong>Annual PMI Schedule- The annual PMI schedule will be rated acceptable if it demonstrates a reasonable approach for how the offeror plans to perform prevenatitve maintenance for the Aircraft Fire Training Facility.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technician Qualifications in accordance with paragraph 1.1.3 of the PWS - Technician qualifications will be rated acceptable if the offeror submits copies of current State of Florida license for handling LP-Gases issued by the Bureau of LP Gas Inspection, Florida Department of Agriculture for all employees performing under this contract.</strong></p>
<p>G. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br />(End of Addendum)</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br>  (ii) SOLICITATION TYPE This solicitation, numbered N6311615-01-ATOMS, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  <br>  (iii) CURRENTNESS The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37.  <br>  (iv) SET ASIDE:  N/A  <br>  (v) REQUIRED ITEMS The government requires the following items:  <br>    <br>  The Army would like the contractor to supply various digital pathology systems, which will include image management and scanners.  These systems are to be used at various military medical commands.  The Offeror is to submit unit pricing for the digital pathology systems available.  Further details will be provided per call. These items are laboratory type products that are used in support of medical research and operational digital pathology projects being performed by, but not limited to, clients within the Department of Defense (DoD) organization and whereas the primary client is typically the Air Force Medical Service or other Surgeon General offices or subordinate medical commands of the DoD.    <br>    <br>  Offerors shall submit unit pricing (inclusive of destination freight) for items represented in their catalog.  The government reserves the right to request quotes from the BPA holders for additional items which may not be currently represented on the list of historical usage.  All proposals submitted shall list the names, phone numbers, and email addresses for the contractor's Authorized Sales Representative, Billing/Accounting Representative, and Government Contract Representative to be assigned to this effort.  <br>    <br>  This BPA can be used as a standalone vehicle or a companion vehicle to a third-party systems integrator contract and shall specify such requirement when an order is placed.  When used with a systems integrator contract, further terms and conditions will be provided by the systems integrator, which the BPA holder will comply with.  For example, this includes dates of delivery, specific deliver details, coordination dates, etc.  The third-party systems integrator point of contact information will be provided in the BPA order.  The purpose of the third-party systems integrator is to facilitate installation, operations, and maintenance of these systems in a military secured environment.  <br>  	Contract Details  <br>    <br>  The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) will enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a three year ordering period.  The BPA holders' submitted pricing (TO INCLUDE ALL APPLICABLE DISCOUNTS & DESTINATION SHIPPING) is incorporated into this Agreement, and all BPA calls will utilize this pricing. Any updates or changes to the pricing must be approved by the Contracting Officer for incorporation into this Agreement.  The BPA holder must allow thirty (30) days for the incorporation of a revised pricing to be incorporated into the Agreement.  No single call order shall exceed $2,000,000.00.  <br>    <br>  This Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) does not obligate any funds and is not a binding contract.  The Government will be obligated only to the extent that authorized BPA calls are actually made under this agreement.    <br>    <br>  Ordering Procedures  <br>    <br>  	Only authorized Government employees who have been specifically named by the Contracting Officer may schedule deliveries under this agreement. STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THIS STIPULATION IS IMPERATIVE.  <br>  The Contracting Officer will provide the BPA holder a written notification of the appointed authorized ordering individuals for calls.  For the moment and until otherwise notified, the individual authorized to place orders for AFMS as an Ordering Officer is:  Trisha Scott at trisha.r.scott.ctr@mail.mil.  <br>    <br>  Each order under this agreement will be assigned a call number by the Army Contracting Command - APG Natick Contract Division (NCD) point of contact.  A call number will be associated with each delivery.  The NCD point of contact is:  Trisha Scott at trisha.r.scott.ctr@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  Invoicing  <br>    <br>  The BPA holder will be required to submit an invoice and receiving report (COMBO) with approving DD250 through Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) for each BPA call delivery. An approving DD250 can be obtained from the NCD by submitting an advance copy of the invoice (before loading into WAWF) to the NCD with the following information:  <br>    <br>  1.	Name of supplier  <br>  2.	BPA number and call number  <br>  3.	Date of Purchase  <br>  4.	Itemized list of accepted items being invoiced for (including quantity, unit price, and extended subtotals/total)  <br>  5.	Date of delivery or shipment  <br>    <br>  The BPA holder shall not bill the client for any items on back order until such items have been shipped, received, and accepted by the client.  If an item is not available for immediate delivery, the BPA holder will inform the client and offer to cancel the order, or place the item on backorder status.    <br>  (vi) DELIVERY   <br>    <br>  The BPA holder shall ensure that delivery ticket information is included with each report delivery.  All deliveries shall contain the following information:  <br>    <br>  1.	Name of supplier  <br>  2.	BPA number and call number  <br>  3.	Itemized list of supplies contained in shipment (including quantity, unit price, and extended subtotals/total)  <br>  4.	Date ordered and the name of the client placing the order  <br>  5.

Otherwise, in most cases, deliveries shall occur within 2 to 5 business days to the client scheduling a delivery.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>In support of the SEC, the scope of this performance-based blanket purchase agreement is to provide data/document conversion/migration; receipt and logging of productions; litigation support database loading; Electronic File Processing (EFP) or Electronic Document Discovery (EDD); documentation production for litigation support; eD2.0 system administration support; records management support; and IT forensics support. The contractor shall collect and analyze electronic evidence in the document discovery process, document and present findings impartially, and objectively analyze such findings in a legal environment using SEC-approved tools, procedures, and techniques developed by the ENF Information Technology (IT) Forensics program. The contractor shall support this effort at either the Government's site or their own depending on the task area. The contractor shall travel to case sites in support of Forensics gathering and analysis.
<p>The SEC has an increasing workload of requests for documents to be processed and to be produced electronically as well as an increasing IT Forensics case load. Several large cases require support where producing the documents in paper form is not feasible. The contractor shall perform computer forensic tasks with due diligence consistent with Federal law and SEC standards and procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall work with other SEC contractors who are providing imaging, electronic file processing, independent quality control, and litigation support software to the SEC. The contractor shall work with other SEC contractors who are performing task orders under this IDIQ contract. The SEC has separate contract vehicles for imaging paper documents and creating structured load files. The structured load file deliverables from other contractors will become input to this contract's database loading work. The SEC receives electronic data in a variety of formats from a variety of sources, including contractors. The contractors for this contract may receive electronic data for further processing from any of these sources. To assist in verifying the quality and consistency of litigation support databases used by the SEC staff, the SEC has an independent contract for quality control, including checking Recommind and Concordance databases against the original paper documents and electronic media.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel, particularly those performing forensic services, will not have ability, discretion or authority to determine investigation/litigation targets or strategy.<br /><br />This is a multiple award contract.</p>

This amendment modifies Attachments 14 and 17.  It also extends the proposals due date to April 30, 2015 and 2:00 PM EST.  The Q&A document and updated RFP are forthcoming and should be posted tomorrow.

<p>8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT<br />(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products.

A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>13.106-2 EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS OR OFFERS<br />After preliminary consideration of all quotations or offers, identify from all quotations or offers received one that is suitable to the user, such as the lowest priced brand name product, and quickly screen all lower priced quotations or offers based on readily discernible value indicators, such as past performance, warranty conditions, and maintenance availability; or<br />(ii) Where an evaluation is based only on price and past performance, make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations or offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best value when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer.</p>
<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<DESC>See attached Pre-Proposal Conference Slides and Revised Draft RFP documents.&nbsp; The USG anticipates release of the final RFP on or about 17 April 2015.<br /><br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />The release of the Final Request for Proposal (RFP) has been delayed.&nbsp; The USG expects to release the final RFP on or about 10 April 2015.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />Please see attached document entitled "Pre-Proposal Conference Notice" scheduled for 15 April 2015; registration due 10 April 2015.<br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br />Please see attached Pre-Solicitation Notice dated 9 March 2015.<br /><br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br /><br />To better understand the impact of PROS business processes upon potential offerors, the USG invites interested parties to respond to the question below:
<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>
****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />See the attached responses to industry questions regarding PROS V Draft RFP.<br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br /><br />The draft RFP package is posted for Industry review and feedback.&nbsp; Questions regarding any content in the Draft RFP package or in regards to this acquisition must be received in writing to the POCs listed below no later than 4:00 pm Eastern, Monday, February 9, 2015.

Describe how the USG should effectively incentivize the Prime contractor to award requisitions that are most challenging.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Describe how Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) and/or Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDRs) are handled within industry. How are SDRs/PQDRs best identified, investigated and resolved?<br /><br />7.

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Caitlin Williams, Phone 9372575799, Email caitlin.williams.6@us.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the research directed at understanding Phase 1 creep at temperatures in the range of 1000 to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit for the following composites: Gr/PI, GR/Ep and GI/PI. A usable computer code must be developed to associate with the various parameters considered. A factor of safety of 1.25 will be applied. The output of this effort will be a set of design stresses as a function of temperature and period of stress application that will provide confidence that a structure subjected to stresses and temperature below the appropriate stress/temperature line will strain less than 0.2%. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541380 - Testing Laboratories. Business size standard is for NAICS 541380 is $15M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Texas A&amp;M University. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, April 6, 2015. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Air Force Institute of Technology is in the process of aiding Eglin Air Force Base in the design of a missile that flies at Mach 5. Dr. Muliana has several research papers in the area of nonlinear viscoelasticity which is a major part of this research. She has access to a student that is interested in working on this research topic as part of the students MS thesis. Texas A&amp;M also has access to various professors in the area of metallurgy that can serve to be a benefit as the project is developed. Dr. Muliana has an extensive background in the required field and is the only individual with both the capability to lead the research and an interested graduate student.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Caitlin.Williams@us.af.mil no later than 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Thursday, April 14, 2015. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0067, Phase 1 Creep Research for Composites." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files).

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Request for Information
<p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate (SMC/MC) has previously posted a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) for the Terminal Modem LRU as part of the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in the Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration (PTSFD) Bidder's Library. The Government requests that interested parties comment on the cost and risk impact of adding the following requirements to the Terminal Modem LRU Section 3.3.1.2 (NMT Specific requirements):<br />[LRUdigIF01] (U) The NMT TM LRU shall include a digital IF interface that conforms to Future Advanced SATCOM Technologies (FAST) Open Standard Digital-IF Interface (OSDI) for SATCOM Systems.</p>
<p>Note 1[NEW]: A subrange of up to 150MHz will be digitized. The digitized interface must be locatable both before or after dehopping in the receive processing chain, selectable as part of LRU configuration. When occurring prior to dehopping, the subrange will be configurable within the full 1.2 GHz range supported by the modem. When occurring after dehopping, the subrange should match the FL channel width. Digitized signal plus metadata will be exported through the transmit side of the Digital IF interface to a digital co-processing system. Digitized signal plus metadata will be imported on the receive side of the Digital IF interface from a digital co-processing system. Imported data will be forwarded to the rest of the NMT TM LRU receive chain. The purpose of the digital co-processing system is to allow the insertion of external signal processing (e.g., interference cancellation) that may not be collocated with the NMT TM LRU.</p>
<p>Note 2[NEW]: Support for the Digital IF interface only exists in the receive path of the NMT TM LRU and not in the transmit path. Hence other methods must be used to connect the analog transmit IF of the TM LRU to upconverters and antennas, such as analog IF-over-fiber equipment.</p>
<p>Note 3[NEW]: The NMT TM LRU may be used in conjunction with an external "digital conversion system" device. In this configuration, the front end of the TM LRU will not be used, and only the receive side of the Digital IF interface will carry user data. If the external digital conversion system includes a dehop function (so the Digital IF interface location in the TM LRU is selected to be AFTER dehopping), the transmit side of the Digital IF interface may be used to export TRANSEC control and time synchronization information generated by the TM LRU.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF02] (U) The NMT TM LRU digital IF data shall be available over the interface as complex samples, composed of 16-bit "In-phase" and 16-bit "Quadrature" (I&amp;Q) components, with sampling rates up to 150 Mbps, and an aggregate rate of up to 70% of the maximum Ethernet physical date rate.</p>
<p>Note: Aggregate rate means the combination of I+Q samples along with the VRT metadata tags and encapsulation.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF03] (U) The NMT TM LRU digital IF shall utilize in-band signaling for context/metadata that conforms to ANSI VITA-49.0, as defined in section 10, Signal and Data Transport (SDT) Object, of FAST OSDI for SATCOM Systems.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF04] (U) The NMT TM LRU FAST OSDI packets composed of VITA 49.0 (content &amp; context), RTP, and UDP elements shall be nominally at or below 80% of the maximum Ethernet physical data rate.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF05] (U) The NMT TM LRU digital IF interface shall enable remoting the NMT digital co-processing system up to a distance of 300 meters.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF06] (U) The NMT TM LRU digital IF interface shall have interchangeable 10GBASE fiber optic transceivers that support a SFP+ connector.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF07] (U) The NMT TM LRU digital IF interface shall have interchangeable 10GBASE fiber optic transceivers that support at least type 10GBASE-SR.</p>
<p>[LRUdigIF08] (U) The NMT TM LRU shall provide the operator the means to enable or disable the digital IF port.</p>
<p>Interested parties should be aware that the Government intends to post all non-proprietary responses to the Bidder's Library. Information provided by interested parties will not be treated as proprietary unless specifically identified as proprietary with the appropriate justification included.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit comments regarding this notice via email to Capt Shane Manuel, shane.manuel.1@us.af.mil, and Mr. Marvin Paquia, marvin.paquia@us.af.mil, no later than 1600 PDT, 20 Apr 2015.</p>
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal; nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>DO NOT CONTACT POSTER - L. NEWHOUSE.  FOR ANY INFORMATION CONTACT:  Mark Conrad, (443) 395-7013  <br>    <br> Synopsis: <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. <br>  <br> US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Security Assistance Management Directorate (SAMD), is conducting this RFI to identify potential sources for the development of EW capabilities as described below on behalf of Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence & Electronic Warfare & Surveillance (IEW&S), Program Manager (PM) Electronic Warfare (EW), Product Director (PdD) Counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW). <br>  <br> Description: <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey on services for a mounted CREW system. Requirements have been identified for a mounted CREW system in order to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) currently being supported by the U.S. Central Command (USCENTOM). The currently fielded mounted CREW system, Symphony, is being used by the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) is not sustainable by the GIRoA; consequently an Afghan sustainable replacement system is required. Approximately 2000 systems will be required to support this requirement with a 10 percent attrition needed to support for a five (5) year time period. This mounted CREW system will be required to provide force protection against RCIED threats in tactical vehicle, specifically the MaxxPro Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP), Armoured Security Vehicle (ASV) and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). With the allotted space within the tactical vehicles established, it is the Government's intent to maximize the reuse of Symphony parts such as antenna mounts and vehicle wiring (Photos of the antennas mounts and vehicle wiring will be made available upon request). As a result, this mounted CREW system shall not exceed 18 quote mark  H x 22 quote mark  W x 30 quote mark  D (457.2mm H x 558.8mm W x 762mm D). This mounted CREW system must be releasable to Afghanistan and meet International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Additionally, the mounted CREW system must be able to be sustained by the GIRoA without the support of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and/or Field Support Representatives (FSRs). In order to help GIRoA sustain the mounted system a training package that will include integration and a  quote mark train the trainer quote mark  package. Additionally, in order to eliminate the need for FSRs and reduce the complexity of installation and operation, the mounted CREW system will be required to have color coded cables along with error proof cables, preventing user error in connecting the mounted CREW system. Error proof cables may include keyed connectors to be used with specific matching ports on the mounted CREW system. Ideally, the mounted CREW system should have a Remote Control Unit (RCU) with simple and easy to understand lights for operation and/or a display readout. The RCU is not a mandatory requirement. The mounted CREW system will be required to provide protection against Radio Frequency Triggers used to denote IEDs. The desired mounted CREW system is a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) solution. <br>  <br> The mounted CREW system is desired have no more than four (4) antennas. All of the mounted CREW system antennas will be required to be ruggedized and able to withstand low hanging debris and environmental obstructions. The mounted CREW system will be required to weigh less than 100 pounds. The mounted CREW system will be required to not exceed three (3) sub-systems however the mounted CREW system will need to be able to power by nominal 24 Volts Direct Current (VDC). The mounted CREW system will be required to operate and be stored in temperature environments between 0 0 F (-18 0 C) to 122 0 F (50 0 C). Additionally, the mounted CREW system will be required to withstand shock and vibration in compliance with MIL-STD-810G Procedures. Lastly, the mounted CREW system must have NO hardware or software that is in use by any CREW system within the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DoS), or any other US Government entity. The Government requests that interested parties submit white papers that fully describe their system capabilities in as much detail as possible. Based on the white paper submission, the Government may elect to conduct a one-on-one discussion based on its analysis of the RFI response, to include the quality of submission and level and scope of the information provided. This may include visit to contractor facilities to assess firsthand the validity of described capabilities and, if needed, its demonstration. Any capability and demonstration must be available for Government assessment no later than 14 May 2015. Those capabilities that show promise may be selected for additional testing at a Government lab on Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Test results from closed loop or compatibility testing may be releasable to other DoD activities. <br> NOTE THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT DISCUSSION OR REQUEST DEMONSTRATION, NOR IS IT LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR EXPENSES INCURRED IN RESPONDING TO THIS RFI. <br>  <br> Answering this Market Survey/Response Format:   <br> Interested parties who believe they are capable of fulfilling this requirement are invited to submit a white paper fully describing their system capabilities. The paper must include company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail  address, telephone number, fax number; business size, unique qualifiers (e.g. large, foreign, small disadvantage, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.).  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word Office 2007 compatible format.  RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger.  The Government acknowledges its obligation under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:    <br>  <br> 1.

<DESC>This is an announcement by the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) on behalf of the Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF) Program Office to announce updated information for the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) Program. This announcement serves as a notification to industry of procurement of Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms. SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments. SANR will provide Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability, offering voice and data networking and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms.     <br>        <br>    This announcement contains two (2) notifications for vendors interested in the SANR acquisition.     <br>        <br>    1. SANR Information Repository Content     <br>        <br>    The Government hereby advises potential industry sources having an interest in the SANR acquisition program of the availability of SANR-related technical data (documentation).     <br>        <br>    The applicable technical data (documentation) may be provided to each authorized vendor and their subcontractors, if applicable. In order to receive a copy of the technical data (documentation), vendors and their subcontractors must be authorized to have access to the Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) Information Repository (IR) AMF SANR folder. To obtain authorization, each vendor/subcontractor must complete the request for AMF SANR access available only on the JTN IR Registration website, https://ir-registration.sd.spawar.navy.mil. Vendors are encouraged to request authorization to the AMF SANR folder as soon as possible. Those vendors that do not have a properly certified Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (DD Form 2345) can start that process immediately by following the procedures documented at the JTN IR Registration website. Access to the JTN IR Registration website requires users to have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate. For information on External Certification Authorities (ECA) vendors that are authorized to provide non-DoD personnel and contractors with PKI certificate services, please see the following website, http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/.     <br>        <br>    Authorized contractors and/or subcontractors interested in the SANR acquisition may be granted access to the AMF SANR unclassified folder on the JTN IR, but access will be allowed only after the contractor/subcontractor has completed and submitted the request for AMF SANR access and only after the DD Form 2345 information is verified by the Government. No classified information will be made available to any contractors or subcontractors via the JTN IR. Contractors and/or subcontractors requiring access to the JTN IR classified artifacts for SANR will be provided the information on a Compact Disk (CD) upon Government confirmation of clearance and approval of a need to know. The CDs will be encrypted in order to protect the data, and will be sent to the contractor's approved address for receipt of classified information. The CD recipients will need to contact the Contracting Officer, Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil, in order to receive the CD's password to decrypt the content. All recipients of the classified artifact CD shall agree to return the CD as well as any/all copies of the Data contained on the CD in the vendor's possession as agreed between the vendor and the Government JTN office.     <br>        <br>    Important Note: All recipients of SANR related JTN IR artifacts from the previous Solicitation No. W15P7T-13-R-5005 must destroy all downloaded data, including source code, and notify in writing to Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) RFP Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement, paragraph (1)(a) and a rejection to access the SANR updated information under Solicitation No. W15P7T-15-R-0014.     <br>        <br>    2.

The selection of a firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather the process for A-E firm selection described in FAR 36 using the competitive ranking of firms based upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  The competitive ranking will be followed by a negotiation with the most highly ranked firm and continuing to lower ranked firms only if satisfactory terms are not reached with the preferred firm as described in FAR 36.606. The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.

Large business firms that intend to do contracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 330, Section C. by identifying subcontracting opportunities with small businesses. If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 219.704/705 as a part of the Request for Proposal Package.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002:
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.</p>
<p>Question 1):</p>
<p>Per ASME, Section VIII Div 1 the Manufacturer is responsible to material verification. Will the government be provided Material Test Reports, Partial Data Reports for the government supplied parts?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The government will maintain the material certs for the government supplied assemblies.</p>
<p>Question 2):</p>
<p>Scope of Work, Section 2.8 states, "Do not paint stainless steel surfaces...." Does the government expect any of the non supplied attachments (lugs, nozzles, couplings, etc.) to be Stainless Steel?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Only the four government supplied assemblies need to be stainless steel.</p>
<p>Question 3):</p>
<p>Section 3.3, subpart calls for the internal Stiffeners Rings to be Stainless Steel Angle. Are these the same Stiffeners identified on drawing 002-3727 #2 as SA 516 GR 70? If so, please clarify which material it is and are these supplied or the manufacturers responsibility to fabricate?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>NCNR Drawing 002-3727 is correct, Section 3.3 is in error, stiffeners will be steel, not stainless steel.</p>
<p>Question 4):</p>
<p>Section 5.0, please identify where on the government supplied drawings where the Pressure Transmitter Support Bracket, the Government Supplied Sub-Assemblies and the listed material are to be located on the tank.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>NCNR Drawing 002-2936 Sheet 1, Section A-A shows the position of the four government supplied assemblies.</p>
<p>On the BOM:<br />Item 1, 002-2938<br />Item 2, 002-2939<br />Item 3, 002-2940<br />Item 4, 002-2937</p>
<p>*Note position of the four government supplied assemblies are referenced to Item 13, Bottom Lifting Lug.</p>
<p>Question 5):</p>
<p>Scope of Work section 2, &para; 2 .10 it states "The contractor is responsible for final placement of the storage tank on the existing cement pad."</p>
<p>Is a site map with the location of the existing pad available in order to determine access and what type of equipment will be required to set the vessel on the pad as well as learning how close the transport vehicle will be able to get to the site?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>There will be no surprises, the pad is right next to the back road, it will be very easy to get a crane in to put it in place.</p>
<p>The pads for rigging it to the crane and are set so the vessel can easy be lifted into place without any special effort.</p>
<p>All other terms remain unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>TB-29X Synopsis on issuance of RFP N00024-15-R-6263
<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive solicitation for the development of a First Article Unit and production of up to sixty-eight (68) TB-29X Thin Line Towed Array Assemblies (TAAs) under a performance specification. This requirement includes Array Receiver Units, Test Sets, Shipping Reels, Engineering Services and Provisional Item Orders. The resultant contract will include one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The RFP is expected to include a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) First Article in the base period with production units being procured on a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) basis for option year 1 and a Fixed-Price-Incentive (FPI) basis in option years 2-4. Engineering and Technical Services will be procured on a CPFF basis with support on a cost-only basis. TB-29X is the future generation planned reliability improvement to the TB-29A. TB-29X will be a 416 channel Thin Line Towed Array (TLTA) with an equivalent acoustic performance capability to TB-29A. This RFP and related files listed under solicitation number N00024-15-R-6263 will be issued electronically. The RFP is expected to be issued&nbsp;in May&nbsp;2015. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it directly to their workstation on or after the date of issuance by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: https://www.fbo.gov.&nbsp; Companies are encouraged to request performance specifications and data prior to issuance of the RFP. However, this information will not be mailed to offerors until the RFP is issued. The performance specification and other related controlled files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance. To attain this clearance, prospective offerors must submit a written request to the PCO Representative,&nbsp;Amanda Gilbert, at <a href="mailto:amanda.k.gilbert@navy.mil">amanda.k.gilbert@navy.mil</a>. The written request must include the company name, cage code, and complete destination address and security point of contact. Once a prospective offeror's "need-to-know and security clearance" is verified and approved, the company will be authorized to receive the performance specification and other related controlled files. DFARS 252.204-7004 Alternate A, Central Contractor Registration, applies. Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information may be obtained via the internet at www.ccr.gov. Once the RFP is issued, the Government will consider all comments received. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions. The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Government's discretion. Access to the unclassified information involved in this RFP does not imply that foreign contractors can fully participate in this procurement. Should a foreign company choose to bid as a prime contractor, please notify the Contract Specialist identified below immediately. No further information can be released to a foreign entity until a favorable foreign disclosure decision is processed. If a foreign offeror decides to team with a U.S. prime contractor then the U.S. prime contractor must comply with the Department of State 22CFR Parts 120-130 and submit a request for an export license. No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified below. This is not an RFP. This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind. This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract. The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in responding to this notice. Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to&nbsp;Amanda Gilbert, Contract Specialist, by phone 202-781-1836 or via email at <a href="mailto:amanda.k.gilbert@navy.mil">amanda.k.gilbert@navy.mil</a>. The contracting officer for this procurement is Mr. Ryan Hackett, phone 202-781-2398, email-ryan.hackett1@navy.mil.

<DESC>1. Synopsis: The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in accordance with FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201, Exchange with industry before receipt of proposals and (FAR) 52.215-3,Request for information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this RFI is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The information resulting from this RFI will determine if there are qualified non-personal service providers available in the marketplace to pursue a Small Business competitive procurement in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.502-2(b), Total Small Business Set-Asides. The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) within the next few months. This RFI does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of the solicitation. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. Offerors not responding to this RFI will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation. When the solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of any potential Offeror to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  <br>    <br>  2. Background: The U.S Army Medical Research and Materiel Command manages and executes research in seven basic areas: medical simulation, training and health information technology, military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine. The command is also the research manager for the DoD Blast Injury Research Program Coordinating Office and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine.    <br>    <br>  3. Scope and Purpose: The Government is seeking specialized expertise for: (1) Knowledge and Management Support Services; (2) Studies and Analysis; (3) Business Process Improvement; (4) Information Management and Processing support services related to the Research Area Directorates (RADs) and the Joint Programmatic Committees (JPCs) in order to provide continuous (a) Knowledge Management, (b) Knowledge Collection, (c) Study and Analysis and (d) Dissemination. The core competencies below support the required specialized expertise. None of the required services are inherently Governmental functions as defined in FAR Part 2.1. However, contract performance requirement in the area of Performance Based Financial Management is considered closely associated with inherently Governmental functions.  Therefore, all contractor employees performing work under the budget planning and financial support area must sign a nondisclosure agreement with specific limited access to the Program Decision Memorandum, Program Budget Decisions, Future Years Defense Program, Program Objective Memorandum and Budget Estimate Submission.  These restrictions are IAW DoD Directive 7045.14,  quote mark The Planning, Programming and Budgeting System quote mark  28 July 1990, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum,  quote mark Control of Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Documents and Information quote mark  dated 27 March 2004.  <br>    <br>  4.  Instructions and information are included in the attached RFI/Sources Sought document. Also included as Attachment A is the DRAFT Performance Work Statement.  <br>    <br>  5. The Government welcomes input and will accept questions pertaining to this RFI; however, the Government reserves the right to answer all questions related to this RFI. Questions pertaining to the RFI are due by 1:00 PM (EST) on 11 April 2015 to brandon.m.roebuck.civ@mail.mil. Only one set of questions per vendor will be accepted. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. UPDATE (4/13/15) - RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS AN ATTACHMENT  <br>    <br>  6. Qualified Small Business firms should submit the Capability Statement in response to this RFI electronically by 3:00 PM (EST) on 6 May 2015 via e-mail to Brandon Roebuck at brandon.m.roebuck.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br>  7.

<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> Sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement W911SA-15-A-0004 for Meggitt Targets has been awarded for a performance period of 19 April 2015 to 18 April 2016.  <br>  <br> Meggitt Training Systems are the live fire target systems that are currently installed at the Fort McCoy, WI firing ranges. These systems consist of over a thousand different parts that could potentially go faulty and need replacement at any given time.  <br>  <br> Authority: Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level or quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)).

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Contracts Management Office (CMO) issued the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) Office wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-12-64 on 30 August 2012. DARPA-BAA-12-64 solicited for revolutionary research ideas for topics not being addressed by ongoing MTO programs or other published BAA solicitations.<br />Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (hereinafter, "NGAS") submitted Proposal Number SK.A239.000 on 29 July 2014 against DARPA-BAA-12-64. NGAS proposed negotiation of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract in the amount of $698,709 with a twelve (12) month period of performance. NGAS proposed a study program to develop novel all-fiber<br />kilowatt technologies (AFKT) for laser coherent beam combination (CBC) and switching. NGAS anticipates this AFKT effort will provide revolutionary capability to field high brightness lasers with low size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) relevant to fielding on platforms of interest to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), by demonstrating 3-kW class, high coherence,<br />switchable output from single fiber apertures. The proposed AFKT effort will mature technology demonstrated on two recently completed, DARPA-funded programs: Revolution in Fiber Lasers [RIFL], which demonstrated ~3 kW single mode fiber amplifiers, and All Fiber Beam Combiner [AFBC], which demonstrated ~1 kW fiber combiners/switches. Both programs produced record-setting performance which NGAS proposes to develop into components ready for robust product transition through two innovative thrusts.

1. Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 19, Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center, 4100 E. Mississippi Ave STE 900, Glendale, CO 80246-3055
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This contracting activity proposes to negotiate a sole source, firm fixed price acquisition with Emergency Care Research Institute, (ECRI). The VISN 19 wide inclusive subscription to the online diagnosis and treatment platforms Health Devices Gold, Alerts Tracker for Devices & Biomedical Benchmark Database will greatly improve patient care for the Rocky Mountain Network Veteran populace.  The estimated cost for the Base Price + Four Option Years is $156,516. 
3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
The requirement is to procure online access network-wide (VISN 19) to the ECRI diagnosis and treatment platforms Health Devices Gold, Alerts Tracker for Devices & Biomedical Benchmark Database.  ECRI provides a comprehensive, integrated differential diagnosis and treatment databases to all providers and any other staff who elects to subscribe to its proprietary membership service. The information is primarily narrative in format and contains extensive rationales for diagnosis and treatment decisions as well as charts, graphs, and calculators. ECRI is a unique intellectual property and a proprietary database provider (Proprietary means that they are the sole owners of the content and it is not duplicated in any other source.) A more detailed description of the unique ECRI platforms is as follows: 
Health Devices Gold: A premier patient safety resource for healthcare decision makers, Health Devices (HD) Gold delivers a broad suite of membership resources to select, use, maintain, and manage healthcare technologies. The System offers a comprehensive portfolio of Web resources and online tools, customized consultation services, and unique reports to help ensure patient safety, track hazards and recalls, and make informed healthcare technology decisions. 

Alerts Tracker for Devices: A smart, comprehensive patient safety solution that helps to mitigate risk by seamlessly controlling the recall and alerts management process. Alerts Tracker Devices features-track recall activity in real time, run reports 24/7, access evidence-based content and guidance on alerts related to medical devices, collaborate with other departments, facilities and systems.  

Biomedical Benchmark: Biomedical Benchmark delivers the standards to help benchmark efficiency. Key device and clinical engineering data, from both ECRI Institute and healthcare facilities, shows how  institutions compares to others of similar size and circumstances-so they can easily identify areas in need of improvement and discover ways to optimize effectiveness. Biomedical Benchmark allows for users to-anticipate equipment life cycles to improve efficiency, identify and evaluate options for equipment services, compare staffing levels to other similar facilities, determine if inspection frequencies can be reduced, reduce service contract costs with service contract analysis. 

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.3 02-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
 ECRI Institute is the sole, proprietary provider of the research & analyses, offered through its membership programs. It holds the copyright to its published materials provided via these programs. Examples of its unique features not available through any other distributor are outlined below: 
a. Health Devices Gold includes results of ECRI's laboratory-based comparative testing of medical devices.  Findings from laboratory evaluations of devices are used by its customers to support objective decision-making on technology purchases.
b. The laboratory testing from its evaluations also uncovers serious safety concerns with medical devices.  ECRI publishes proprietary reports called Hazard ReportsÂ© to warn healthcare organizations about these safety problems and to provide advice on how to prevent them.  These reports are exclusively distributed through its Alerts Tracker system.
c. ECRI also runs several problem reporting systems in which ECRI Institute conducts research on the reported problems to develop additional proprietary reports on medical device safety concerns. These reports are also exclusively distributed through Alerts Tracker.
e. Biomedical Benchmark contains comparative data on medical device service performance. Healthcare organizations can use the data in Biomedical Benchmark to assess - at the unique model level - how their medical devices are performing compared to other devices from other hospitals.  Biomedical Benchmark data can also be used to compare how a hospital's medical device service professionals are performing on unique model devices compared to service professionals from other hospitals.     
6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 
This requirement will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201(b) in an effort enhance competition from as many sources as possible. 
7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and reasonable:

The anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the sole-source availability of this database and the critical nature of diagnosis and treatment information it provides. Other facilities in VISN 19 along with Cheyenne VA Medical Center have done market research repeatedly looking for other vendors who may be able to provide similar services. The Department of Veteran affairs have entered into similar Sole Source purchasing arrangements with ECRI for the same service requirements within the last year. VA24114P2034 ($30,312), VA25615C008 ($58,168) and VA24014P0112 ($50,008.95) all confirm the proprietary and PF&R nature of ECRI's product line. In addition, the bulk pricing afforded to the VA as a result of this VISN 19 network-wide purchase is another factor supporting the price fair and reasonable nature of this sole source procurement. 
8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:
The database is available online and authenticated by membership subscription. ECRI is unique intellectual property and a proprietary database and as such, can only be provided by ECRI. 

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:
There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
