<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Services &nbsp;intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order for Dynabeads Protein G used in the CDC's mission to isolate Butyrylcholinesterase (Bche) from biological matrices, specifically human blood to Life Technologies 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, N.Y. 14072. The contract will be for four months with 2 four month option periods. The isolated BchE using Dynabeads Protein G facilitates the detection of human exposure to nerve agents.
<p>The requirement stipulates that methods used within&nbsp;the lab&nbsp;must adhere to rigorous standards set forth by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The lab has used Life Technologies Dynabeads historically to build and develop their existing CLIA methods. These methods rely on the Dynabeads to have a high amount of consistency in variability, compatibility, quality and chemistry. Life technologies has the capability to consistently produce the exact product needed for future methods to meet the standards set forth in proficiency tests.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters has released a solicitation, titled Early Career Faculty (ECF), as an appendix to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2016 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2016), on February 11, 2016. The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ , selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Early Career Faculty (ECF)." <br /><br />STMD, and the Space Technology Research Grants (STRG) Program in particular, seek proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of faculty members beginning their independent careers. This solicitation is focused on supporting outstanding faculty researchers early in their careers as they conduct space technology research of high priority to NASA's Mission Directorates and STMD. NASA is seeking proposals that plan to pursue innovative, early-stage space technology research in the topic areas specifically enumerated in the solicitation. <br /><br />Our Nation's universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly-found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industrial, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. academic institutions promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country's scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. <br /><br />Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The proposed research project must be led by a single, eligible Principal Investigator (PI). The PI must be a recent Ph.D. recipient, defined as having his/her degree conferred on or after January 1, 2009. The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency. The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort; Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators (other than NASA civil servants/JPL) are permitted. See the solicitation for complete requirements regarding eligibility and for definitions and restrictions regarding collaborators. <br /><br />A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this solicitation.<br /><br />NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all institutions and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities to apply. <br /><br />The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in fall 2016. NASA plans to make approximately 6-8 awards as a result of this ECF solicitation, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals. The actual number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received; NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this solicitation. <br /><br />All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent (highly encouraged, but not required) are due by March 4, 2016. Proposals are due on or before April 1, 2016. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the solicitation. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. <br /><br />Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Procurement questions may be addressed by e-mail to the procurement point of contact on this solicitation, Kimberly Cone, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) documents located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved. <br />

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetics Branch plans to procure a maintenance service contract on a sole source basis from Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide preventative maintenance for government owned Illumina HiScan and two Illumina MiSeqs.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. It will be awarded as a base year plus four option years, firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is engaged in the study of cancer genetics. Investigating genetics alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer is an integral function of the Genetics Branch. By using ultra-high throughput, next generation sequencing, and whole-genome high-resolution beadchip reagents, the Genetics Branch is able to study DNA/promoter interactions, gene expressions, methylation status, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and investigate genomic rearrangements.</p>
<p>The Illumina HiScan and MiSeq is a massive parallel next-generation sequencing by synthesis instrument, which has become a core technology for genome analysis and discovery in the Genetics Branch as is related to the biology of cancer. High throughput sequencing is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology where the ability to generate every increasing amounts of sequencing data is key. In addition, the Illumina cBOT are used to prepare samples to run on the Illumina HiScan and MiSeqs equipment. The extended warranties will allow the NCI to continue to generate sequence data relevant to our research on the Illumina HiScan and MiSeqs.</p>
<p>The current requirement of the Genetics Branch is for a 12 month plus four additional option years of preventative maintenance for all labor, materials and equipment for Illumina HiSeq and two MiSeqs. All maintenance services shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard commercial maintenance practices.</p>
<p>Illumina is the only known company that provides warranty and maintenance on the HiScan, MiSeqs and cBot equipment. The content related to this equipment is proprietary and protected under patent rights. Therefore, it is unavailable from other sources than the original manufacturer. Use of any other service agreements on these instruments would void support of the equipment by Illumina.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 5:00 PM EST, on February 26, 2016. All responses and questions can be emailed to Kimesha Leake, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at kimesha.leake@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02RC62533-24 on all correspondence.</p>

<SUBJECT>PAP-8E Aggregometry System Test Tubes / Cells / Stir Bars
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-CSB-HL-2016-085-JML
<RESPDATE>021916
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bio/Data Corporation, 155 Gibraltar Road, Horsham, PA 19044-2303, to provide the PAP-8E Aggregometry System Test Tubes / Cells / Stir Bars to the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Population Sciences Branch (PSB) in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is involved in the study of blood diseases and genetic associations for measurable blood traits. Part of the branch is particularly focused on the biology of platelet reactivity and population variation and associations with such measures. As part of the research, the laboratory requires collection of new Platelet Reactivity and Blood Cell count data in the NHLBI Framingham Heart Study.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The laboratory will test both platelet rich plasma (PRP) aggregometry and whole blood based aggregometry using three (3) different systems. These systems are tested separately because whole blood provides the context of platelet reactivity / function when in the environment of other cell types (e.g., white cells). Platelet reactivity data collected at population scales (i.e., thousands of samples) is rare in research studies. These data will provide Government scientists a valuable resource to make new genetic and epidemiological discoveries relating to Platelet biology, a system that is targeted for many pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>A known issue of major importance in the platelet reactivity field that must be addressed is batch to batch variation in platelet agonists, as well as inconsistencies across different suppliers of the same agonists (these are the critical reagents that induce platelet reactivity). Thus, to ensure the validity of data across all three (3) testing systems, the lab requires a contractor that can provide dedicated Lots / Batches of platelet agonists to test ~2,000 samples over 1.5 years. This contractor must have a track record for providing high quality agonists. They must also be able to store at their site dedicate Lots for our project for an extended period of time and deliver subsets of these lots on demand over the period of performance. The lab also requires test cells, stir bars, and test kits that are specifically manufactured for the PAP-8E equipment in order to conduct this research.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the PAP-8E Aggregometry Test Tubes / Cells / Stir Bars with the following quantities:</p>
<p>- Micro Test Tubes, Siliconized (100 pcs.) (Qty. 180)<br />- Micro Stir Bars (50 pcs.) (Qty. 320)<br />- ADP (3x0.5mL) (Qty. 70)<br />- Arachidonic Acid (3x0.5mL) (Qty. 40)<br />- Collagen (3x0.5mL) (Qty. 120)<br />- Epinephrine (3x0.5mL) (Qty. 70)<br />- AggRecetin (1.0-1.5mg/mL) (Includes 2.0 mL diluent) (Qty. 60)<br />- TRAP-6 amide kit (50 tests per vial) (Qty. 40)<br />- U46619  (1mg) (Qty. 7)<br />- LTA Check Performance Test Kit (2 Tests per Year) (Qty. 3)<br />- LTA Check Software (Qty. 1)</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that there are very few contractors that provide equipment for platelet reactivity testing. The lab has previously purchased the Bio/Data Corporation PAP-8E aggregometer. In order to use the system for data acquisition, the lab requires specific test tubes / cells and stir bars that fit the PAP-8E system. The lab also requires test diagnostic kits to ensure the system is running properly. These items are all specific to the PAP-8E system and are not available from any other manufacturer.</p>
<p>Bio/Data Corporation has proven capability to produce and provide a wide range of platelet agonists in large quantities and at high quality. For this project the lab requires the manufacture / delivery of seven (7) different platelet agonists from Bio/Data (ADP, Arachidonic Acid, Collagen, Epinephrine, Ristocetin, TRAP-6 amide, U46619).</p>
<p>A known issue of major importance in the platelet reactivity field that must be addressed is batch-to-batch variation in platelet agonists, as well as inconsistencies across different suppliers of the same agonists (these are the critical reagents that induce platelet reactivity).Thus, Bio/Data is able to manufacture large lots of all seven (7) agonists that will be dedicated mostly to the lab's needs to reduce the impacts of batch-to-batch variation. They must store and deliver on demand subsets of dedicates Lots to the lab over a period of ~2 years so that we can conduct high quality testing of ~2,000 samples. Bio/Data has a track record for providing high quality agonists and tests the integrity of each batch and reports quality control metrics so the lab can adjust protocols accordingly. Bio/Data is also able to store dedicated Lots at their site for this project for an extended period of time and deliver subsets of these lots on demand over the period of performance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bio/Data can supply calf-tendon derived Type I collagen agonist, whereas some contractors supply equine-tendon derived Type I collagen. The properties and activities of calf-derived and equine-derived collagen are known to be quite different, and thus dramatically effect research outcomes (as NHLBI has previously showed in genetic studies: Johnson et al. 2010 Nature Genetics). The lab has also acquired the BioData PAP-8E aggregometer and so BioData will stand by and guarantee the quality of the delivered agonists since they know the lab will largely employ them on their own system. The lab previously collected platelet reactivity data from ADP, Epinephrine and Type I calf-tendon derived Collagen using BioData supplied agonists in a different sample (Framingham Gen2 sample, ~1991-1995). In order to increase the potential to compare new results with this historical Framingham data, the best option is to once again use BioData supplied agonists (e.g., calf-derived collagen) for this award.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 500. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-86 (February 1, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

<a href="mailto:sarah.landers@navy.mil">Main Official POC</a>
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of Network File Servers and supporting media as itemized in Attachment (1) to support the E-2D Fleet (retrofits) in Orange Park, FL and E-2D tactics devices (spares) in Norfolk, VA.
The contract is planned for Ampex (cage code 0PN68) of Redwood City, CA under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 (a) (2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.  
Ampex is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to provide this part, since Ampex is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the E-2D Network File Server and supporting media component parts.
 The anticipated award date is July 2016 with delivery in 2017.  The anticipated contract value for this procurement is $4.9M total.
Ampex designed these parts to aircraft specifications and remains as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) who can meet the form, fit, function requirements necessary for timely delivery.  Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports there does not exist another commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governments requirement.  Additionally, the Small Business Office concurred with the approach to sole source to the OEM (Ampex). 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice outlining the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Ampex.
  Interested sources are solicited to provide their written technical capabilities.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Interested sources must submit detailed written technical capabilities to deliver the E-2D Network File Servers and supporting media to support the E-2D Fleet and E-2D tactics trainer devices to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed written capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Sarah Landers (sarah.landers@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 applications (MS Word), no later than close of business on Monday, 29 February 2016.
 Verbal submissions via phone will not be honored. 
All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.
 If no written challenge to this synopsis is received, a justification and approval (J and A) for other than full and open competition in accordance with the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 (a) (2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a) (2) based on the rationale provided above will be initiated. If conducted as a sole source procurement, a separate synopsis will not follow. This synopsis will satisfy the intent of the requirements under FAR 5.201 and 5.204. In accordance with FAR 5.102(e), copies of the solicitation will be available upon request.

<CONTACT>John F. Lord, Regional Contracting Officer, Email jlord@usaid.gov - Elena Parinova, Acquisition and Assistance Specialist , Email eparinova@usaid.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Pre-solicitation Notice is to notify that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine intends to award a six-month Contract by issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP).
<p>USAID is seeking the services of a full-service public relations/communications/ advertising firm to assist USAID in the conceptualization and execution of public awareness campaigns aimed at increasing the awareness of several reform initiatives underway in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Through this activity, USAID seeks to increase Ukrainian public support of the reform process (goal).  In order to meet this goal, two "sub-goals" or principles have been determined as follows:</p>
<p>1)	Citizens better understand the reforms that the Government of Ukraine (GOU) is undertaking.</p>
<p>There appears to be much confusion and misunderstanding among Ukrainians on how or even whether the Government is actively pursuing reforms. GOU ministries too often present varying and conflicting messaging, aimed more at defending their own more narrow interests than the broader and more strategic interests of the GOU or Ukrainians. In addition, competing political interest in an unstable and very competitive political climate are putting forth conflicting messages for tactical gain.  As a result, many Ukrainians are unaware of the reforms that are taking place, their components, and the timelines for action.</p>
<p>2)	Citizens better understand how reforms will improve their lives.</p>
<p>The GOU not provided its citizens with a good understanding of the need for specific reforms and how those reforms are beneficial to the average Ukrainian citizen.  Even when citizens see that reforms are bringing about change, they do not understand the benefits that they might receive. Many Ukrainians are concerns that any change that might occur will primarily benefit entities close to the Government or special interests, such as oligarchs.</p>
<p>The RFP for the Contract is expected to be issued at the end of February 2016 on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). When the RFP is issued, any amendments thereof will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to the availability of funds.  This pre-solicitation notice in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms located within a 350 mile radius of the Battle Creek VA Medical Center, 5500 Armstrong Road, Battle Creek, MI 49037. The mileage restriction is in compliance with VAAR 805.207(b). This requirement is being procured in accordance with the VAAR 836.606-73 as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  

Description of work to be performed includes: Architect-Engineering services are required for Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Technical Specifications, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, Cost Estimates, and all other related information for Project #515-16-108, Install Central Vacuum Return System.  The project will include design work for the preparation of 100% complete working drawings and contract documents using edited VA Master Specifications to complete the following:  

I.	STATEMENT OF AE TASKS
The Architect/Engineer shall provide design services necessary to furnish:  Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Bid Documents, Technical Specifications, Cost Estimates, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, As-Built Documentation, and all other related information as outlined in the "A/E Instructions" for Project 515-16-108, Install Central Vacuum Return System, at the VA Medical Center in Battle Creek, Michigan
 
The A/E shall design a new vacuum return system that will pull the station condensate back to the new boiler plant.  The design shall detail work within each building so the system works efficiently and accurately while deleting unnecessary equipment.  The new central vacuum return system shall pull the condensate return to a centralized location and feed it back to the new boiler plant at Building 300.  The A/E shall recommend one or more locations for the new central vacuum return system and coordinate the final location with VA Engineering.  This project involves the design of a new underground steam condensate vacuum pump station including civil, structural, mechanical, and electrical disciplines.

The A/E shall research the existing record drawings to confirm existing piping configurations and equipment.  Research shall include the review of original vacuum return system, subsequent changes to vacuum return system, and the existing piping configuration and size.  The A/E will shall become familiar with the new boiler plant and steam site piping changes associated with the new plant.  The A/E shall review record drawings to determine which buildings have condensate pumps installed and develop a plan to remove the pumps.  AE shall field investigate the current system from the current boiler plant out to each steam fed building and determine existing conditions.  AE shall field verify each individual building and detail existing condensate return systems.  

The Battle Creek VAMC Steam distribution and condensate return system were originally designed and installed in the 1940's.  The original condensate return system was design as a vacuum return system with a series of parallel vacuum pumps located in Building 30 (the original boiler plant).  At some point around the 1980's the Vacuum Return system was taken out of service.  In the more recent past, the condensate return system was altered by installing some gravity return piping and condensate pumps in the basements of various buildings to help "push" the condensate.  Most, if not all of our buildings have been retro fitted with electric or steam driven condensate pumps to assist with the evacuation of condensate from the building. 

The AE will receive a total of 190 days to complete the design, broken down as listed in the design instruction and including the required two weeks for government review between stages.


Design completion timeframe of 190 days after receipt of the Notice to proceed. The A/E firm shall also be required to perform construction period services after award of the construction project contract. In accordance with FAR 36.204 and VAAR 836.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction project is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.

Qualifications (SF330) submitted by each firm for Project #515-16-108 for "Install Central Vacuum Return System" will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria: 

Prospective firms are required to address all selection criteria within submitted SF330 packages using additional pages as required and SF 330 submissions including any additional pages are not to exceed fifty (50) pages. Selection criteria shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836.602-1 as follows:

(2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  specific experience and technical skill in the type and scope of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
(3) Capacity to Accomplish the Work: the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office which will be responsible for the majority of the design and the ability to accomplish the work in the required time will be evaluated.

Project past performance references older than 3 years will receive a lesser score than those references for projects accomplished within the past 3 years. 

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. Scoring will be based off of the proposed location of the Prime Contractor Firm for this category and scoring shall be as follows:  within 50 miles - Excellent (Blue); 51-100 miles - Very Good (Green); 101-150 - Acceptable (Yellow); 151-200 - Marginal (Orange); 201-250:  ; 251-350 - Poor (Red).

<CONTACT>Kevin J. Parker, Contracting Officer, Phone 508-233-6175, Email kevin.j.parker3.civ@mail.mil - Yvette M. Daltorio, Acquisition Specialist, Email yvette.m.daltorio.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Product Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PdM-ICE) is conducting market research to identify tropical uniform fabrics, uniform designs, and boots that provide durability and protection, improved moisture management, and reduced dry time in a tropical environment.  The tropical combat uniform includes a blouse, trouser, and boot.   PdM ICE plans to conduct a user evaluation on the most promising materials and end items.
<p>Respondents are encouraged to submit fabrics or uniform prototypes that are suitable for a tropical environment.  PdM ICE intends to use a Government-owned design for the tropical uniform, although end- item designs will also be considered as an alternative to the Government-owned designs.</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of the new tropical uniform will be improved performance in a tropical environment.  It is expected the tropical combat blouse and trousers will have similar durability and protection as either the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) or the Enhanced Flame Resistant Combat Ensemble (EFRCE).  In addition fabrics should meet the additional performance attributes listed in Table I, but trade-offs may be considered.  For reference, the MCCUU and EFRCE Product Descriptions are included with this announcement.  Preference will be given to materials that do not deteriorate in tropical conditions (e.g. materials that do not become weaker when wet) and materials that significantly exceed MCCUU durability requirements (e.g. break and tear strength) while meeting weight and dry out time requirements (see Tables I and II - Performance Attributes for Woven and Knit Tropical Combat Uniform Fabrics).</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of a new tropical boot will be improved performance in a tropical environment.  The new tropical boot shall have similar qualities to the Marine Corps Combat Boot requirements.  The boot must operate within a tropical environment, with performance based upon boot durability.  Submissions shall incorporate innovative designs which utilize fabric and synthetic leathers to increase dry out time, while reducing weight and moisture retention caused by natural leather. Additionally, the tropical boot must be lighter weight and faster drying when compared to the current combat boot.  The outsole must allow for easy removal of mud, debris, and foreign substances.  The Marine Corps tropical boot can vary in height as long as the boot provides ankle support to the wearer.  (see Table III - Performance Attributes Tropical Boot)</p>
<p>Lastly, PdM-ICE is conducting market research to determine if the current Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) could be flame resistant (FR) treated.  Treatment should be low cost, and could be applied during fabric manufacture, as a post treatment, or in garment form.  Treatment shall not alter appearance, comfort, or durability properties.  The treatment must  meet the vertical flame performance Objective (desired) requirement contained in Table I below.  For reference, the MCCUU Product Description is included with this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors may submit test data from similar test methods that demonstrate performance of their submitted fabric and/or end item.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>PdM-ICE will hold an Industry Day from 7-10 January 2016 in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The Government plans to conduct one-on-one meetings with industry.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to exchange information regarding this RFI and the performance requirements, and discuss with Industry their potential materials, garment designs, and boots. Industry must inform PdM-ICE representatives if they are able to supply materials and end-items that could meet these requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Day Registration:</p>
<p>All sources who want to meet with the Government should request a meeting.  Date, time, and meeting location will be provided once all meeting requests are received.  Meeting requests should be sent via e-mail to Betsy Moore at betsy.a.moore.civ@mail.mil by 15 December 2015 with a courtesy copy to the Contract Officer Kevin Parker, kevin.j.parker3.civ@mail.mil .

SCOPE OF WORK Western Area Power Administration (Western) is seeking information on potential sources that can provide a Power Repayment Study (PRS) solution.
DESCRIPTION Western delivers power from 10 rate-setting projects that encompass both Western?s transmission facilities and power generating facilities owned by the Bureau of Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers and the State Department?s International Boundary and Water Commission.  These projects are made up of 14 multipurpose projects.  Power and transmission rates are set to recover all costs associated with the power delivery.  Western performs analysis using the PRS to determine that power and transmission rates for each project are adequate to cover obligations, including annual expenses and repayment of Federal investments.  Data in the PRSs detail historic, current and future year, projection data.  This data includes capital investments, future projections, required payments, interest expense, and annual operating expenses. The PRS is a financial modeling tool, designed to provide realistic simulations of repayment obligations based on inputted variables.  The goal for the PRS solution is to enable the Western Rates community to explore the effects of carefully planned changes and adjustments to the variables and the structure of repayment obligations to determine optimal revenue requirements for power and transmission rates.  This analysis is a continuous process throughout the year.  Western staff require continuous access and functionality of the PRS.

<DESC>The NASA/JSC/White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) plans to procure test, evaluation, and facility operations support services at WSTF as a follow-on to the current Test Evaluation and Support Team (TEST) Contract, ending April 30, 2016.  This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to request industry information for consideration to assist in formulating a contract strategy for the TEST2 procurement. <P> WSTF is a unique environment in that it is a remote, hazardous testing facility. It provides unique propulsion test expertise and has capabilities for altitude and ambient testing. WSTF laboratories perform testing designed to better understand materials and components used in space flight. Some of the testing includes: oxygen systems, propellant systems, hypervelocity impact testing, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV), and standard materials testing. WSTFs hardware processing office currently provides support for: Flight and Critical Hardware and Depot Processing Component Services (clean room and valve refurbishment), Fabrication Services Measurement Standards and Calibration Laboratory, Photo/Video Services, and Technical Publication Services. Additional requirements include: Facility Maintenance and Operations, Institutional Systems and Services, Management and Documentation Systems. <P> WSTF also maintains an environmental program under a separate Environmental Compliance and Operations (ECO) Contract, which provides environmental compliance, restoration, remediation, and operations tasks, maintains site-wide multi-media environmental compliance, manages a large-scale groundwater monitoring program, as well as successfully initiates and completes environmental clean-up projects (restoration). <P> WSTF customers include: International Space Station (ISS) Program, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle Program, Goddard Space Flight Center, and other NASA Centers.  Additionally, WSTF works with the following other Government agencies: Army, Navy, Air Force, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency.  Support will continue to be provided to any future Agency Programs, as well as external customers both private and Government. <P> WSTF is certified to the ISO 9001 and 14001 standards as a joint Government and contractor certification; additionally, NASA and several of the site contractors are OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star certified.  Interested parties are encouraged to address their experience in working within organizations that adhere to these standards. <P> The current TEST contract is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus-award-fee and fixed-price type contract.  Typical work under the TEST contract includes but is not limited to the following: propulsion subsystem and system testing at both ambient and simulated altitude conditions; propellants, aerospace fluids materials, and components testing; remote hazardous testing; hypervelocity impact testing; flight hardware processing; technical services training; quality test and institutional safety and health facility maintenance; and construction management.  <P> The current TEST Statement of Work and other pertinent documents are located at the procurement website: <A HREF="http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/TEST2">http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/TEST2 </A>	  .  It is anticipated that the scope of work for TEST2 will be similar to TEST.  The current North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the WSTF/TEST contract is 541712 with a Size Standard of 1,000 employees.  It is anticipated that the NAICS code and size standard will be the same for TEST2. <P> This synopsis is a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit comments from industry and to solicit capability statements from qualified companies.  Industry is invited to review the questions listed below and provide feedback on the specific areas requested.  <P> (1) What changes from the current TEST contracting approach, if any, would you suggest for the follow-on TEST2 contract and why? At a minimum please address each of the following items below: Contract Content, Contract Type, and Contract Structure. For your proposed contract structure address how will safety performance and testing and evaluation support be enhanced?  Additionally address any performance standards, methods of work authorization, and Small Business Goals which should be considered by NASA. <P> (2) Identify barriers to competition that could be mitigated to foster a more competitive environment for this procurement.  <P> (3) The current TEST contract includes cost and fixed-price work (hybrid), discuss whether a hybrid contract is appropriate and identify your approach for administering and managing a hybrid contract. <P> (4) Contract Incentives:  Provide feedback regarding incentive arrangements.  For instance, how should risks versus rewards be shared by the Government and contractor? What types of incentives would you consider to be most effective to encourage the contractor to perform high quality work at a reasonable price? Discuss your views specific to TEST2 regarding incentive fees, award fee, or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance in terms of: 1. Fixed-price requirements; 2. Cost type requirements. <P> (5) Identify any portion(s) of this procurement for which fixed-price contracting could be utilized and provide rationale and feasibility. Identify any portion(s) of this procurement for which fixed price contracting could not be utilized and provide rationale.  <P> (6) Metrics and Measures of Success: Provide feedback on metrics or measures of success NASA might consider to monitor the contractors performance on the potential fixed-price or incentive fee portions, as well as the portions that are not fixed-price? <P> (7) Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize synergy between the labor skills needed for employees across the contract, and how to best cross-utilize the workforce. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider. <P> (8) NASA is considering ways to increase the use of these unique or not otherwise commercially available WSTF facilities/capabilities by non-Government customers, on a mission non-interference basis, as a potential means of reducing long-term costs.  Under the current TEST contract, NASA allows the contractor non-exclusive use of WSTF facilities operated by the contractor under the TEST contract to perform work for non-Government customers on a reimbursable basis.  Please discuss thoughts on how to structure this contract or implement incentives to encourage the contractors efforts to find additional non-Government customers for unique WSTF facilities on a mission non-interference basis. <P> (9) Small Business: <P> a. How can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that Agency small business goals are met or exceeded? <P> b. Identify any areas of the TEST SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. <P> (10) Describe the effect a 1-year award fee period would have on your ability to perform on this contract. <P> (11) What recommendations do you have for cost estimating tools on large government contracts? <P> (12) How do you see WSTF being able to broaden its business-base specifically related to the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan? <P> (13) What kind of efficiencies/innovations has your company successfully implemented on other similar facilities and/or contracts?  Were there contract barriers that needed to be overcome for successful implementation? <P> (14) Describe your experience and provide recommendations for contractor provided vehicles versus Government provided vehicles. Further describe your experience with contractor provided vehicles as follows: <P> a. Are they direct costs or billed as overhead? <P> b. Are they commercially owned/leased or leased through GSA? <P> c. Are there any fees associated with the cost of providing the vehicles? <P> (15) Describe the benefits of a contract period of performance greater than 5 years. What advantages and disadvantages does a greater than 5 year contract provide? <P> The documents on the NASA procurement website are strictly for information and planning purposes to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition.  The information received will not be released in its submitted form, to the extent permitted by law, but may be used in developing the best approach for any follow-on contract strategy and therefore may be recognizable.  The contractor is responsible for marking any proprietary information included with its submission. <P> Responses shall include the company name, address, and point of contact.  The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e) - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE/TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communications Mission Solutions (SCMS) Division is soliciting information and comments from industry on its ability to provide a non-developmental or Commercial- Off- the Shelf (COTS) solution that provides a modernized Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR) Project 25 (P25) compliant Master Site system with zone controllers. In addition to the new Master Site system, the Government seeks information regarding a Key Management Facility client, Network Management Systems, Dispatch Consoles and an IP Logging Recorder. <br />The modernized components will support operation in an Information Assurance (IA) compliant ASTRO 25 network. The Government seeks a system which provides assured voice and rapid response upon activation of the radio push-to-talk. The system will provide fully-featured, trunked communications, even after withstanding multiple points of failure. Levels of redundancy are needed to be built into the design to allow the proposed architecture to retain the greatest level of communication and the broadest scope of features in the unlikely event that a supporting subsystem or component fails. <br />The system will provide system managers with the ability to monitor, program, diagnose, and maintain the ASTRO 25 system. Operating in a client/server environment, system management features will need to be accessible across the IP network from any Network Management (NM) client. The network management applications will align with the Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS) model by utilizing a combination of applications and interfaces. This includes web based applications such as the Unified Event Manager (UEM), Unified Network Configurator (UNC), and Provisioning Manager as well as unidirectional and bidirectional interfaces.<br />A Key Management Facility (KMF) client will operate with the system to support Over-the-Air Rekeying (OTAR). A P25-compliant OTAR solution is required to allow key administrators to securely rekey radios from the proposed Key Management Facility client. OTAR is to eliminate the need for radios to be physically rekeyed using a Key Variable Loader (KVL) and cable. Once a rekeying update is activated on the OTAR-enabled ASTRO 25 system, encrypted radios anywhere within the radio coverage area will automatically receive updated encryption keys without any disruption to ongoing communication. The system will provide immediate wireless delivery of new key material to prevent a compromised radio from accessing the ASTRO 25 system over any channel, clear or encrypted.<br />RESPONSES</p>

The current method relies on the Regional Security Office of the US Embassy to provide final employment vetting and approval to ensure that all LES (Locally Engaged Staff) and contract personnel who require un-escorted access to DOS facilities overseas do not pose unacceptable risks to the safety and security of US Government personnel and property. <br /><br />4. In order to adequately evaluate the potential options, DS requests the private sector to provide their thoughts and approaches that addresses the objectives, included in this document. The Respondent's approach shall include detailed explanations of its proposed methodology, to include cost efficiencies and realistic ways to accomplish the goals and objectives. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />D. Operational Approach</strong><br /></span>1. A WWV support team shall support Department of State polygraph examiners (either direct-hires, or Personal Service Respondents) with vetting LES and 3rd party contractors at the Department's overseas facilities. <br /><br />2. A WWV support team shall consist of a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a) regional linguist, translator/interpreter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b) biometric/database collection specialist, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; c) field support technician, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; d) badging office specialist; <br />using Government provided equipment and software (details of the type of equipment, weight, etc., are not important at this time.&nbsp; Assume shipping shall be provided by the USG.)<br /><br />3. All individuals shall require a <strong>SECRET</strong> Clearance.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>E. Example of Goals (Scenarios)</strong></span><br />A WWV support teams may encounter the following type of scenarios over the course of 5 years.&nbsp; For each, provide thoughts on the time to schedule, feasibility of obtaining skill sets, time needed to deploy team or acquire assets.<br /><br />1) Deploy a WWV support team to support one (1) Department polygraph examiner in Tunis, Tunisia for thirty (30) days. Upon completion the examiner will move on to Malta with the biometric/database specialist, field support technician, and badging office specialist for two (2) weeks of vetting (Maltese speak English). The team will then arrive in Morocco for thirty (30) days and will join with two (2) additional Department polygraph examiners and their WWV support teams. Respondent shall need to ensure the proper regional linguist is provided for each leg.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) Two (2) Department polygraph examiners will spend thirty (30) days in Uganda, then thirty (30) days in Kenya, and then thirty (30) days in Tanzania requiring support of: linguist, biometric/database specialist, field support technician, and badging office specialist in each country. Contractor shall need to ensure the proper regional linguist is provided for each leg.<br /><br />3) A regional linguist on a sixty (60) day deployment to Cairo gets food poisoning the second week in country and must be evacuated back to the States. Contractor shall need to replace the regional linguist with 24 hours.<br /><br />4) Three (3) Department polygraph examiners will spend thirty (30) days in Manila, Philippines; then thirty (30) days in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and then thirty (30) days in Jakarta, Indonesia requiring support of a regional linguists able to work in each country cited, a biometric/database specialist, field support technician, and badging office specialist (no language skill required for the bio-metrics, field support tech, or badging office specialist).<br /><br />Note 1.&nbsp; In each scenario given above, the region and country are interchangeable with any country that contains a US Embassy or consulate.&nbsp; The scenarios given may be concurrent, may partially overlap, or occur in series with 2 weeks between scenarios.&nbsp; Therefore, it needs to be understood that deployment team schedules may or may not be consecutive; or they may overlap, depending upon the mission.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><strong>F. Responses and Assumptions</strong></span><br />1. For submission purposes, the respondent shall assume that DS shall provide consultation to the respondent and the respondent shall not provide primary vetting (polygraph) services. <br /><br />2. Given the sensitivity of these requirements, DS will not consider a simplistic list of proposed steps. Accordingly, the respondent should endeavor to be precise as possible as to the best way to accomplish this type of mission, considering the vast number of regional linguists required for such short deployments.<br /><br />3. This effort is not to be considered as long term consecutive deployments, but instead, the respondent needs to view this requirement as short, quick deployments.<br /><br />4.Respondents shall prepare their responses, using the scenarios and objectives given below:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>G. Objectives</strong></span><br /><strong>Objective 1:</strong> Provide regional linguistic support for each region that a DoS vetting specialist (polygrapher) is responsible for.<br /><strong><br />Objective 2:</strong> Provide vetting support to achieve effective screening, specifically to seek out connections to adversarial groups (e.g., Terrorist, Insurgent, Foreign Intelligence, etc.).<br /><strong><br />Objective 3:</strong> Provide vetting support to achieve effective screening, specifically to seek out that he/she does not represent a threat for other criminal activity: theft, fraud, sexual crimes, etc., which would pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of US Embassy personnel and property. <br /><strong><br />Objective 4:</strong> Provide vetting support to achieve effective screening, specifically to seek out that they do not pose any other unacceptable risks to US EMBASSY personnel or property (e.g., uncontrollable contagious disease, etc.).
<p><strong>Objective 5:</strong> Provide vetting support to re-assessment procedures. These DS procedures will ensure that all LES (locally engaged staff) receive periodic reviews, at the appropriate frequency, to determine whether or not an individual remains suitable for continued employment/performance under the contract.<br /><strong><br />Objective 6:</strong> Under this system, all records, specifically bio-metrics, must be maintained electronically by the Respondent using Government provided equipment and software. The contents of the entire system must be reliable and the Respondent must be able to provide records within 8 hours of a DOS request.</p>
<p>1. Respondents should address the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a) show how they will acquire regional linguists based on schedule or provide their window of how long it would take to secure a regional linguist.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b) show how they will retain other team members (Bio-metrics tech, field support, badging, etc.).<br /><br />2. Respondents should advise what is thought to be an unacceptable duration (not cost efficient or effective).&nbsp; For example, 1 deployment every three months may not make it worth the while. Conversely, respondents should advise the most cost effective or efficient schedule (1 deployment every 30 days). This may require the Government to devise a schedule for the Offeror to meet.<br /><br />3. It would be responsibility of the Offeror to provide vetting support personnel under its control (employees, subcontractors, 1099, etc.).</p>

2.	CONTRACT TITLE.
Cooperative Studies Program ISO 9001 Multi-user Site License (Current 2015 and Former 2008 standard) for Albuquerque, Boston, Hines, Palo Alto, Perry Point, and West Haven and CSP CRPCC ISO 15378:2015 for Albuquerque


3.	BACKGROUND.

ISO 9000 is a set of standards for quality management systems.  The International Organization for Standardization maintains the ISO 9001 standard, and conducts periodic updates to improve or clarify quality standards. The ISO 9001 was updated in September 2015 and the new standard is currently ISO 9001:2015. The organization also approves certification bodies to administered accreditation to the ISO standard.  CSP (Albuquerque, Boston, Hines, Palo Alto, Perry Point, and West Haven) contracted with an accreditation body and is currently ISO 9001:2008 registered. In addition, Albuquerque is also registered to a Good Manufacturing based ISO standard, 15378:2011.   ISO 15378:2015 was updated and reissued in October 2015. Registration to an ISO 9001 standard certifies that formalized quality management processes are being employed consistently to meet customer and regulatory requirements; those processes are continually improved to enhance customer satisfaction; and a third party has validated those processes.  

CSP's quality program is surveilled and monitored to the ISO standard annually. CSP must now update their Quality Management Systems (QMS) to adhere to the new 2015 standards by 2018.  Moreover, the Registrar's auditor must see that CSP is making a good faith effort and planning to conform to the new standard in the interim years. As part of that effort, CSP needs access to both the new and old standard in an electronic format to ensure proper Center wide analysis and updates to current system processes. While individual copies could be purchased for a few, vendors prohibit sharing. All employees should be able to access the standard for robust deployment of the QMS. A multi-user site license for ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015 posted on a CSP SharePoint site is more cost effective.  

4.	SCOPE.

The purpose of this procurement is to provide electronic multi-user site license access to the needed standards (ISO (001:2008, ISO 9001:2015 for CSP (Albuquerque, Boston, Hines, Palo Alto, Perry Point, and West Haven) and ISO 15378:2015 for Albuquerque on a CSP SharePoint site.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  This is not a request for offers or proposals.  This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  This is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources with the capabilities and experience to perform the required work.  This announcement is seeking information regarding contractors who qualify as a Small Business.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  (For additional information on small business size standards and small business programs, please visit www.sba.gov)<br /><br />
<p>This project will take place at the J.W. Peck Federal Building in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It will be the contractor's responsibility to provide all the management, supervision, manpower, equipment and supplies necessary for completing the pre-construction, demolition, and construction phases of this work.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region (Region 5), is conducting market research and is seeking sources for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services, including Design Phase services and Construction Phase services.  Design Phase services will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price basis.  Construction Phase services will be awarded with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). A CMc is defined as a firm engaged to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The requirement for this opportunity includes restacking the IRS within the building and renovating their current space, as well as renovating building vacant space for incoming tenants. The project will be renovating only interior customer spaces and will not provide improvements to any public spaces that would be unrelated to the primary tenant needs (such as core building restrooms renovation, lobby improvements, elevator modernization, parking garage improvements, landscaping, and exterior improvement). IRS currently occupies 165,000 USF within the Peck and 65,000 USF in leased space. IRS needs to consolidate space, and plan to do so by completely eliminating the 65,000 USF of leased space and reconfiguring space within the Peck to implement new workplace strategies. They have requested a final total of approximately 115,000 USF of space in the Peck Building to accommodate this move and restacking effort. GSA proposes that 4 other agencies move leases into the Peck building with the following approximated space requirements:  DOE at 75,000 sq ft, US Trustees at 4,200 sq ft, SSA ODAR at 21,000 sq ft, and OSHA at 6,500 sq ft.</p>
<p>This project will aim to achieve LEED-CI Gold and is currently registered under LEED Version 2009.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  The estimated construction cost is between $25,000,000 and $35,000,000.</p>
<p>Design Phase services include, but are not limited to, construction management services, constructability reviews, program reviews, code reviews, mean and methods reviews, cost estimate development and reconciliation services, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development submissions, value engineering suggestions, identification of problems or errors in design and design documents, US Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED&reg; scorecard, BIM coordination and involvement, materials compatibility, tolerances, consistency, consultation during design document production, preliminary project schedule development, independent pricing of design document phase and construction phase submittals, preliminary cost estimates, development of subcontractor and supplier interest, and coordination with long-lead items, and market analyses. Review and comment on the constructability of integral architectural and/or engineering elements required by the drawings in the design stage submission documents.  Develop, maintain and update a construction work sequence plan, addressing, but not limited to: construction phasing approach, preliminary construction schedule, including phasing and temporary/swing space moves, including all aspects of tenant relocations, construction work sequence plan for constructability and logistics issues, and schedules for award of subcontract construction packages.<br />Construction Phase services include, but are not limited to, all work and services necessary for construction of the project, project management, selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors, coordination of regular construction meetings, critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control, monitoring of construction costs, progress reporting, conducting and coordination of inspections and testing and all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable building. <br />No other information will be available at this time.</p>

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) depends upon the unique capabilities of IBM BigFix integrated with IBM Cognos and multiple internal data source feeds for enterprise (including Internet device) visibility, vulnerability management, threat detection, incident response, internal/external security compliance reporting and general endpoint management.  In order to maintain and operate this critical platform VA requires renewal and consolidation of maintenance and support services, additional licenses and flexibility in the additional licensing to allow for the shift of endpoint types over time (e.g. servers to workstation licenses, workstations to mobile devices (if the need arises)) in order to reflect the inevitable changes in enterprise make-up without forcing certain licenses to go unused and additional licenses to be acquired unnecessarily.   

VA is seeking a 3 to 5 Year Enterprise Support Agreement (ESA) that supports the infrastructure below, which is a snapshot of VA's current infrastructure.  If an alternate (non-IBM) solution is proposed please identify how the solution will replace the current infrastructure as well as how the solution meets VA's desired ESA. 

"	370,000 IBM BigFix perpetual workstation licenses and needs to renew service and support on those licenses;
"	138,500 IBM BigFix perpetual server RVU-based licensing and needs to renew service and support on that licensing;
"	Flexible licensing so that it supports the changing endpoint composition across all IBM BigFix products currently owned; Allow for the optional addition of IBM BigFix platform add-on features (currently available and being developed) during the life of the EA at a pre-set cost at the time of renewal or during any contract year (base or options).   
"	Requires additional licensing across all owned products to support a total of 560,000 (+60,000) endpoints immediately;
"	Requires the ability to optionally add licenses as needed in increments of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 (contract options) and all license pricing should be at the matching tier that reflects discounting based off of 560,000 endpoints 
"	Currently requires two full-time IBM Advanced Value Program (AVP) staff that have direct access to IBM Development and may optionally need to add resources in the future at a cost in synch with current AVP costs (contract options). 
"	Owns the equivalent of 280 PVU licensing of IBM Cognos Business Intelligence for executive-level dashboards and needs to renew service and support on that licensing;

This ESA must be in place by in April/May 2016 in order to provide seamless support as the older contracts being replaced expire.


NOTE:  Please indicate whether you are including information on name brand IBM products/services or, "or equal" products.  If or equal products are identified, include detailed product descriptions and any available product literature/information that will assist VA in determining whether the solution is implementable.

In addition to addressing the questions herein, please provide the following information for your company:

"	Company Business Size and Status

<DESC>I. Introduction.
<p>This sources sought announcement is for informational purposes only and does not represent a solicitation announcement. It is not to be construed as an obligation on the part of the Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD). In order to proactively plan for future requirements, WHS/AD is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, and women-owned concerns) capable of providing Graduate Business School Executive and Post-Training Support to the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program (SDCFP). Please see the attached summary Performance Work Statement which outlines the overall performance objectives.</p>
<p>II. Background.</p>
<p>Each year, senior officers from each Service are selected to spend a year in Corporate America at leading edge businesses, i.e. Corporate Sponsors, to observe, participate in, and learn corporate best practices in such areas as, business processes and organizations, utilization of information technology, long-range planning, innovation, and change management that could be implemented to transform DoD. The SDCFP Fellows form a cadre of future Service leaders sensitized to the organizational and operational opportunities made possible by the revolutionary changes in information and other technologies. Each incoming group of new Corporate Fellows requires pre-assignment training to educate them on the fundamentals of contemporary business, and the different trends and factors that drive strategic business planning. This training should also examine transformations occurring in the corporate sector for their potential relevance to defense operations, restructuring and planning. Because the SDCFP is a unique program, where military officers with no prior experience in the civilian corporate environment are assigned to train in corporate assignments, a customized curriculum is required. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications from capable small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, and women-owned concerns). This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD) to the ultimate acquisition approach. No contract will be awarded from this announcement and requests for solicitation will not receive a response. No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is NAICS: 611430 Professional and Management Development Training.</p>
<p>At this time, no solicitation exists. The range for this acquisition is from $50,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is for a base period of twelve (12) months plus four- 12 month option periods.</p>
<p>III. Instructions:</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8340-00-NIB-0019<br />Name:		Tarp, Standard, Polyethylene, 20' x 25', Grommets<br />Description:	Standard polyethylene tarp used for protection of machinery, equipment and for protection from sun and weather. Product is reversible green and tan, woven using 8 x 8 thread-count construction weighing 3.8 to 4 oz. per square yard with a nominal thickness of 7mil. Cut size is 20' x 25'; nominal size is 19' x 24.33'. UV-protection incorporated in the manufacture. Contains 28 grommets per tarp. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		8340-00-NIB-0020<br />Name:		Tarp, Heavy Duty, Polyethylene, 20' x 25', Grommets<br />Description:	Heavy duty polyethylene tarp used for protection of machinery, equipment and for protection from sun and weather. Product is reversible black and white, woven using 12 x 11 thread-count construction weighing 6.5 to 7 oz. per square yard with a nominal thickness of 14mil. Cut size is 20' x 25'; nominal size is 19' x 24.33'. UV-protection incorporated in the manufacture. Contains 28 grommets per tarp. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8340-00-NIB-0019<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	57173460; PTBL020030U; FS-P8mil</p>
<p>NSN:			8340-00-NIB-0020<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	57173494; FS-P12mil; PTSW020024U</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than February 26, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request For Information - Novel Training Datasets and Environments to Advance Artificial Intelligence
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-16-03
<RESPDATE>040116
<ARCHDATE>05022016
<CONTACT>R. Jacob Vogelstein, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-16-03@iarpa.gov
<DESC>Synopsis<br /><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information on novel training datasets and environments to advance artificial intelligence (AI).  This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering purposes; the RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals.  IARPA anticipates that responses to this RFI will be used to inform future funding opportunities for creating novel training resources for artificial intelligence algorithms.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
<p><br />Background and Scope</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence, defined here as computer simulation of cognitive processes such as perception, recognition, reasoning, and control, have captured the public's imagination for over 60 years.   However, artificial intelligence research has proceeded in fits and starts over much of that time, as the field repeats a boom/bust cycle characterized by promising bursts of progress followed by inflated expectations and finally disillusionment, leading to what has become known as an "AI winter" - a long period of diminished research and funding activity.  Until recently, the conventional wisdom has been that new algorithms were the limiting factor in making steady progress towards artificial intelligence.  However, recent advances in machine learning, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, have established that historical algorithms (e.g. backpropagation) in conjunction with high-performance computers can be used to achieve nearly human-level performance on diverse tasks such as image and speech recognition, language translation, and video game play.  In each of these instances, and in many others, rapid progress was facilitated by the availability of massive amounts of training data well-suited to the problem under study.  This realization raises the prospect that many additional artificial intelligence problems may be solvable in the near-term, without significant innovations in the underlying algorithms, if the right training resources become widely available.</p>
<p>Training resources for algorithms such as discriminative classifiers and generative models typically require a large collection of static labeled samples, each of which is represented as an (input, output) pair.  For example, training data for an object recognition algorithm might consist of a set of images of objects or scenes, each of which is accompanied by a textual description of the object type(s) contained therein.  In contrast, training resources for reinforcement learning algorithms typically provide a dynamic interactive environment for a simulated agent and supply evaluative feedback based on the agent's actions.  Examples include simulators such as MuJoCo and the Arcade Learning Environment.</p>
<p>Through this RFI, IARPA is seeking input from the artificial intelligence research community on training resources that, if created, would be most likely to drive progress in new problem domains within the field of artificial intelligence (including machine learning).  In particular, respondents are asked to answer one or more of the following questions:</p>
<p>1.	Which problem domain(s) has the greatest potential to benefit from the availability of new training resources and why?</p>
<p>2.	What new training resources are needed to achieve significant progress in this domain?  How should these resources be structured?  How do the proposed resources compare with currently available resources?</p>
<p>3.	What kind of effort is needed to create and/or curate these training resources?  What technical, logistical, and/or legal challenges would be associated with such an effort?  How much would such an effort cost, and how long would it take?  How much effort and money would be required to store, maintain, distribute, and/or utilize the proposed training resources?</p>
<p>4.	Who would be the major stakeholders in the proposed training resources?  How would these stakeholders use the proposed resources?</p>
<p>5.	Annual challenges (e.g. ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) employing a standard set of data for training and/or evaluation have helped to catalyze progress in many machine learning problem domains.  Should a challenge be created in the proposed problem domain, and if so, how should it be designed, implemented, and judged?</p>
<p><br />Preparation Instructions to Respondents</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US.  This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>All responses shall be formatted for printing on standard 8.5" x 11" paper with 1-inch margins.  Text shall be no smaller than 12-point Times New Roman font.  Responses shall include:</p>

<CONTACT>Evans, Stewart
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to JEOL USA Inc., Dearborn, MA for maintenance and service; a base year plus two option years, on a USGS owned JEOL JXA-8900 Electron Microprobe located in Menlo Park, CA.  This piece of equipment was acquired in 1992 to provide high quality in-situ quantitative chemical analyses of geologic materials in support of science disciplines across the USGS.  There are only two (2) companies worldwide that even make such instruments (JEOL and Cameca), which automatically limits the potential sources of technical and service support.  It also means that parts are very specific and come from the factory, as opposed to being available from numerous sources.  The electron microprobe is a large complex instrument that by definition must yield high-precision data and by demand must run nearly 24-7.  Replacement parts, hardware, software and technician expertise must be specific to the JEOL instrument in order for the instrument to produce high quality data with little downtime.  In the 23 years the Government has had a service contract with JEOL, there has been excellent service and very little downtime as a result of their quick response, expertise, and availability of parts. JEOL has the factory trained field service engineers. JEOL provides emergency repair and preventive maintenance for the instruments that they manufactured. JEOL has the expertise and support from the factory.  JEOL's replacement parts meet original instrument specifications. There is no other source that meets these requirements. Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS requirement may submit a proposal to the Contracting Officer no later than 03/11/2016 at 1400 EST. As required by FAR 5.102(c) (1) the RFQ G16PS00233 will be made available upon request. Contact the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov for a copy of the RFQ. All submissions will be considered by the agency and evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Estimated period of performance to start 04/01/2016.

For further information, please contact the Contracting Specialist at (916) 278-9334 or sevans@usgs.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to proceed with a sole source requirement above the simplified acquisition threshold.  The contractor is Link2Health Solutions (L2HS), Incorporated.  This procurement is for the acquisition of back-up call center support services for the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office, Office of Mental Health Operations, Veterans Crisis Line (VCL). In addition to back-up call center support, services also include front-end routing from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) to VCL; back-end routing of calls from VCL to back-up center(s);  and providing crisis intervention services when VCL responders are not available.. The period of performance will include a 12-month base period with two (2) 12-month option periods
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act has assigned tollfree numbers to be used as national suicide prevention numbers. The FCC has assigned the NSPL exclusively to SAMHSA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). L2HS is the only entity permitted to use, manage and monitor the NSPL.  Furthermore, L2HS, as the sole grantee of SAMHSA, administers the NSPL and is the only entity with the ability to ensure that all calls placed by Veterans on the Lifeline network are properly routed to the VCL (front-end routing).
The Government intends to negotiate with only one source as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

Agency Name -<br /><br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br />National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health<br />Office of Mine Safety and Health Research<br />626 Cochrans Mill Road Pittsburgh PA 15236-3611<br /><br />B. Research Opportunity Title -<br /><br />Capacity Building and Ground Control Research for the Mining Industry<br /><br />C. Program Name -<br /><br />Office of Mine Safety and Health Research<br />Research Opportunity Number - Request for Proposal (RFP) 2016-N-17733<br /><br />D. Response Date -<br /><br />This announcement will remain open until 04:00 pm Eastern time on March 28, 2016, with full proposals being received prior to this end date/time.<br /><br />E. Research Opportunity Description -<br /><br />The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) permanently established the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research under the direction of an Associate Director, within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. One purpose of this office is to enhance the development of new technology and technological applications and to ensure adequate capacity in important research areas. The MINER Act grants the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research the authority to award competitive contracts and grants to institutions and private entities to improve mine safety and health in general, and specifically to encourage the development and manufacture of mine safety equipment and to award contracts to education institutions or private laboratories for the performance of product testing or related work with respect to new mine technology or equipment. This announcement is an opportunity for the award of contracts for ground control research and capacity building.<br />Background and Need: Stable mine openings and highwalls are fundamental to ensuring the safety of miners and providing a zero-harm work environment. Underground mining has one of the highest fatal injury rates of any U.S. industry, more than five times the national average for worker fatalities, and ground failures are the single largest source of those fatalities. During the past decade, approximately 40% of underground mining fatalities were caused by roof falls, rib collapses, or bumps/bursts. In addition, approximately 600 miners are non-fatally injured every year by rock falls in coal mines, and these injuries tend to be severe. Yet, the number of mining professionals with expertise in mine ground control engineering has declined significantly over the past few decades because of retirements, a declining number of graduates, and a lack of research funds to support training of professionals in this critical area.<br />The underground coal mine disasters of this decade involving roof collapses have brought this deficiency of talent to the forefront. In 2007 six coal miners and three rescue workers perished in two coal bumps at Utah's Crandall Canyon Mine and a roof collapse also help trigger a methane explosion in Alabama at the Jim Walter Resources No. 5 Mine in 2001, which claimed 13 lives. NIOSH is committed to rebuilding capacity in the area of mine ground control.<br />This announcement is directly related to the NIOSH OMSHR strategic goal to:<br />&bull; Eliminate ground failure fatalities and injuries in the mining industry.<br /><br />Objective: The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, NIOSH, is soliciting proposals from universities or colleges specifically focused on ground control to conduct research, exploratory development, testing, or evaluations of new innovations and technologies to improve mine health and/or safety.<br /><br />The objective of this BAA is to address important mine ground control safety issues and to develop a new cohort of mine ground control experts through graduate education. Applicants are given significant flexibility in defining proposed research areas. As such, all basic or applied mine ground control research topics that have an impact on safety will be considered. Topics can be applicable to all types of surface or underground mining or can be pertinent to only a specific mining method or mineral commodity. Sample research areas include but are not limited to:<br /><br />1. Identification of conditions and mechanisms that lead to mine instability;<br />2. Controlling ground failures in underground mines;<br />3. Controlling highwall collapses in surface mines;<br />4. Improved rock support, including roof bolting technology and supplemental support;<br />5. Mine design guidelines;<br />6. Advances in geotechnical numerical analysis;<br />7. Improved backfilling technology;<br />8. Innovative mine stability monitoring; and ,<br />9. Advanced in situ rock mass characterization.<br /><br />A parallel intent is to provide an adequate supply of qualified geotechnical engineers and professors specializing in mine stability to ensure the future health and safety of our nation's mine workers.<br /><br />Contract awardees are expected to produce graduates with doctoral and/or master's degrees in mining engineering or a related field in an engineering discipline with a specialization in mine ground control.<br /><br />F.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer. <br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred. <br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Blank space shall read: Price, Technical Capability and Past Performance. Basis of Award - The Government will award a contract, from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on price. Offeror's price quote will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness. Prices which are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable may receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>The award will be made to the contractor whose price is the lowest of all offers determined to be technically qualified of performing the required service in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br />Technically qualified is defined as meeting the minimum requirements in Past Performance, Technical and Price as listed below. No trade-offs are made. To receive consideration for an award, the offer must NOT receive an<br />"unacceptable" rating for the non-price factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make its award decision without discussions. Therefore, each offeror is encouraged to provide the Government with all of the information necessary to evaluate its proposal under the evaluation factors<br />stated above.</p>
<p>Offerors that fail to submit all the information necessary to evaluate their proposal with their initial proposal bear<br />the risk that their proposal will be rejected without discussions.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer<br />conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The<br />following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance:<br />a. To demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror shall submit two past performance questionnaires demonstrating performance of relevant work, to be completed and returned with solicitation. If offeror has no past performance of this nature, a neutral rating will be given per FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv).</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RATING<br />ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has a reasonable expectation that<br />the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown<br />UNACCEPTALBE Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has no reasonable expectation that<br />The Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>2. Technical Capability:<br />a. Offeror shall provide written documentation of Audio Visual System Installation Plan. (Narrative describing Audio Visual procedure)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL RATING<br />ACCEPTABLE Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />UNACCEPTALBE Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>3. Price:<br />a. Offerors SHALL complete and submit the price schedule with their offer and include a total price for the line item. Failure to do so will result in the offer being rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will evaluate each offer's price in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 to determine price reasonableness. In this context, reasonableness will be determined by comparing offered prices to one another, to the Government estimate and to pricing for previous work of a similar nature.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer),<br />whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(Paragraph 2) A review of past performance will be conducted on this requirement. The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System&#8208;&#8208;Statistical Reporting (PPIRS&#8208;SR) application (http://www.ppirs.gov/) will be used by the contracting officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance. In the case of a supplier without a record of relevant past performance history in PPIRS&#8208;SR for the FSC or PSC of the supplies being purchased, the supplier may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for its past performance history.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation or offer represents the best value to the Government.</p>

<p>USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (MAR 2010)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2007)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically. <br />The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. For Vendor Registration Assistance and account activation, please contact the DISA Ogden E-Business Help Desk at 1-866-618-5988 option 2. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site. Training for this application is available at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>Notice to Vendors: Delivery of services to any address other than the delivery address specified in the contract is not authorized without a contract modification signed by the Contracting Officer. Failure to deliver to the address in the contract will result in rejection of invoices and will cause delay in payment.</p>
<p>Contract Administrator for this Contract is: TO BE ASSIGNED AFTER AWARD</p>
<p>The contractor is directed to use the "2-in-1" format when processing invoices and receiving reports. When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions:</p>
<p>Contract Number TO BE ASSIGNED <br />Delivery Order <br />Cage Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Pay DoDAAC M67443<br />Issue Date TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Issue By DoDAAC H92257<br />Admin By DoDAAC H92257<br />Ship To Code/Ext M20970<br />Ship From Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />LPO DoDAAC "Leave Blank" <br />Acceptor Email Address TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext "Leave Blank"</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the "Issue By DoDAAC", "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Pay DoDAAC". Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for "Combo," "2-in-1," and "Cost Voucher" are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under "Vendor Interface" section. On the Vendor Interface page click on "WAWF-RA" header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either "Combo," "2-in-1," or "Cost Voucher" to download the instructions. <br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications. Contractor shall click on "Send More Email Notification" on the page that appears. Add the acceptor's/receiver's email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks, to include contract administrator SSgt Porfy Aragon at Porfirio.Aragon@socom.mil. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system. <br /><br />NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Best Theratronics located in Kanata, Ontario, Canada for emergency repairs to an Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd Gamma Cell 40 irradiator.<br /><br />This repairs will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br /><em>FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency<br /><br />(a) Application. This authority applies to those situations where (1) an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and (2) delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.<br /></em><br />An urgent procurement is being processed to repair a Gamma Cell 40 irradiator which has experienced an unexpected failure of the interlock system and source movement rods causing the equipment to become inoperable.  The failure of the unit has caused highly sensitive and essential research within the School of Medicine to completely stop and it jeopardizes the project which is being conducted in collaboration with other agencies.  Two vendors were contacted regarding this repair and only one response was received from Best Theratronics.  As further delays will jeopardize the research project, it is recommended that a sole source award be provided to Best Theratronics.<br /><br />All conditions provided in FAR 6.303 and 6.304 exist.  The justification has been documented and has been determined to be accurate, items included in FAR 6.303-2(b) have been recorded, and the contracting officer has approved the action, which is expected to be under $700,000.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Offerors interested in responding to this notice must do so by 3:00 p.m. EST on February 22, 2016.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (sherri.ori@usuhs.edu).    <br />

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.
Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.
The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Technical Tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. All offeror's shall provide with their proposal: descriptive literature, brochures, and a technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. The technical proposal response MUST include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description and provide sufficient supporting technical literature. Solely restating the paragraphs of the purchase description or limiting the response to a simple statement of compliance is not acceptable. Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph, you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it.</p>
<p>The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the basic year, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 2 EACH).</p>
<p>(2) For the option years, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity available on the Option CLIN. Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.</p>
<p>(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a)&nbsp;Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.&nbsp; The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br /> b)&nbsp;Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br /> c)&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.&nbsp; Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br /> d)&nbsp;For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS.&nbsp; Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx.&nbsp; DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br /> e)&nbsp;Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4.&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.&nbsp; If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.&nbsp; Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">a)&nbsp;The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br /> b)&nbsp;The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time period, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, Deputy Command Counsel, 4400 Martin Road, Rm A6Se040.001, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax:(256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>This is an announcement by the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) on behalf of the Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF) Program Office to announce updated information for the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) Program. This announcement serves as a notification to industry of procurement of Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms. SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments. SANR will provide Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability, offering voice and data networking and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms. <br /><br />This announcement contains two (2) notifications for vendors interested in the SANR acquisition. <br /><br />1. SANR Information Repository Content <br /><br />The Government hereby advises potential industry sources having an interest in the SANR acquisition program of the availability of SANR-related technical data (documentation). <br /><br />The applicable technical data (documentation) may be provided to each authorized vendor and their subcontractors, if applicable. In order to receive a copy of the technical data (documentation), vendors and their subcontractors must be authorized to have access to the Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) Information Repository (IR) AMF SANR folder. To obtain authorization, each vendor/subcontractor must complete the request for AMF SANR access available only on the JTN IR Registration website, https://ir-registration.sd.spawar.navy.mil. Vendors are encouraged to request authorization to the AMF SANR folder as soon as possible. Those vendors that do not have a properly certified Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (DD Form 2345) can start that process immediately by following the procedures documented at the JTN IR Registration website. Access to the JTN IR Registration website requires users to have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate. For information on External Certification Authorities (ECA) vendors that are authorized to provide non-DoD personnel and contractors with PKI certificate services, please see the following website, http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/. <br /><br />Authorized contractors and/or subcontractors interested in the SANR acquisition may be granted access to the AMF SANR unclassified folder on the JTN IR, but access will be allowed only after the contractor/subcontractor has completed and submitted the request for AMF SANR access and only after the DD Form 2345 information is verified by the Government. No classified information will be made available to any contractors or subcontractors via the JTN IR. Contractors and/or subcontractors requiring access to the JTN IR classified artifacts for SANR will be provided the information on a Compact Disk (CD) upon Government confirmation of clearance and approval of a need to know. The CDs will be encrypted in order to protect the data, and will be sent to the contractor's approved address for receipt of classified information. The CD recipients will need to contact the Contracting Officer, Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil, in order to receive the CD's password to decrypt the content. All recipients of the classified artifact CD shall agree to return the CD as well as any/all copies of the Data contained on the CD in the vendor's possession as agreed between the vendor and the Government JTN office. <br /><br />Important Note: All recipients of SANR related JTN IR artifacts from the previous Solicitation No. W15P7T-13-R-5005 must destroy all downloaded data, including source code, and notify in writing to Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) RFP Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement, paragraph (1)(a) and a rejection to access the SANR updated information under Solicitation No. W15P7T-15-R-0014. <br /><br />2. Government Site Visits <br /><br />The Government hereby advises potential industry sources having an interest in the SANR acquisition program of Government's interest to visit vendors' facilities that intend to produce the SANR. <br /><br />The purpose of the site visit is for AMF's market survey update and to provide vendors an opportunity to demonstrate small airborne technology, the status of SANR NDI activities, and manufacturing capabilities. <br /><br />Vendors interested in hosting AMF Program Office representatives at their facilities will need to contact Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil in order to schedule the visit. The Government will only be available from March to May of 2015 to conduct site visits. <br /><br />Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) (Attachment 1) <br /><br />Vendors are advised that employees of the firms identified in Attachment 2 of this announcement may serve as non-government reviewers during Government SANR market research, to include but not limited to site visits and request for information activities. These individuals will be authorized access only to those portions of the Vendor provided data and Government discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties. Such firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition. If a vendor requires these firms to sign a PDPA, vendors must notify in writing to the below firms point of contact within two (2) weeks of this announcement publication date. <br /><br />This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br /><br />Contractors interested in the SANR procurement are advised to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov for additional updated information about the SANR program. <br /><br />---Change 1--- <br /><br />The purpose of this modification to the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) announcement is to provide an updated list of non-government reviewers (Attachment 2) that may be used during SANR market research activities. Please see Attachment 2 to this announcement modification for the complete list. <br /><br />---Change 2--- <br /><br />The Product Manager for Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF), in support of the Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR), seeks industry feedback regarding availability of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms. SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments. SANR will provide Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability on any channel, offering voice and data networking and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms. <br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense.

If an RFP, for Solicitation No. W15P7T-15-R-0014, is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br /><br />Content of RFI Response: <br /><br />Interested parties are invited to submit technical information describing a SANR solution and its supporting ancillaries that most closely meets the requirements in the draft SANR Performance Requirements Document (PRD).

<DESC><strong>UPDATE - "new tropical boot" paragraph only;<br /><br />A Product Demonstration Models (PDM) Tropical Boot shall be received at MARCORSYSCOM, PdM ICE no later than 21 March 2016. PDM shall be delivered to the following address and POC; <br /><br />Todd A. Towles, Project Officer<br />MARCORSYSCOM Program Manager (PdM ICE)<br />2200 Lester Street<br />Quantico, VA 22134<br />Tel: 703-432-3608<br /><br />An inspection and down select of the boot PDMs will be conducted and manufacturers will be notified of the findings. Successful PDMs (as identified by PdM ICE) may be awarded a contract to provide boot field test prototypes for use during a Field user Evaluation (FUE) taking place during summer of 2016. Only one PDM is required per manufacturer. Submitted initial PDMs must successfully pass the visual examination. If awarded a contract, an estmated 100 pairs will be purchased for the FUE. Sizes will range from 9R - 12R with half sizes 9.5R and 10.5R. A complete size tariff will be provided at time of contract award.<br /><br />FUE prototypes will be required to arrive at MARCORSYSCOM NLT 1 June 2016</strong><br /><br /><br />Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Product Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PdM-ICE) is conducting market research to identify tropical uniform fabrics, uniform designs, and boots that provide durability and protection, improved moisture management, and reduced dry time in a tropical environment. The tropical combat uniform includes a blouse, trouser, and boot. PdM ICE plans to conduct a user evaluation on the most promising materials and end items.
<p>Respondents are encouraged to submit fabrics or uniform prototypes that are suitable for a tropical environment. PdM ICE intends to use a Government-owned design for the tropical uniform, although end- item designs will also be considered as an alternative to the Government-owned designs.</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of the new tropical uniform will be improved performance in a tropical environment. It is expected the tropical combat blouse and trousers will have similar durability and protection as either the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) or the Enhanced Flame Resistant Combat Ensemble (EFRCE). In addition fabrics should meet the additional performance attributes listed in Table I, but trade-offs may be considered. For reference, the MCCUU and EFRCE Product Descriptions are included with this announcement. Preference will be given to materials that do not deteriorate in tropical conditions (e.g. materials that do not become weaker when wet) and materials that significantly exceed MCCUU durability requirements (e.g. break and tear strength) while meeting weight and dry out time requirements (see Tables I and II - Performance Attributes for Woven and Knit Tropical Combat Uniform Fabrics).</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of a new tropical boot will be improved performance in a tropical environment. The new tropical boot shall have similar qualities to the Marine Corps Combat Boot requirements. The boot must operate within a tropical environment, with performance based upon boot durability. Submissions shall incorporate innovative designs which utilize fabric and synthetic leathers to increase dry out time, while reducing weight and moisture retention caused by natural leather. Additionally, the tropical boot must be lighter weight and faster drying when compared to the current combat boot. The outsole must allow for easy removal of mud, debris, and foreign substances. The Marine Corps tropical boot can vary in height as long as the boot provides ankle support to the wearer. (see Table III - Performance Attributes Tropical Boot)</p>
<p>Lastly, PdM-ICE is conducting market research to determine if the current Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) could be flame resistant (FR) treated. Treatment should be low cost, and could be applied during fabric manufacture, as a post treatment, or in garment form. Treatment shall not alter appearance, comfort, or durability properties. The treatment must meet the vertical flame performance Objective (desired) requirement contained in Table I below. For reference, the MCCUU Product Description is included with this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors may submit test data from similar test methods that demonstrate performance of their submitted fabric and/or end item.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>PdM-ICE will hold an Industry Day from 7-10 January 2016 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Government plans to conduct one-on-one meetings with industry. The purpose of this Industry Day is to exchange information regarding this RFI and the performance requirements, and discuss with Industry their potential materials, garment designs, and boots. Industry must inform PdM-ICE representatives if they are able to supply materials and end-items that could meet these requirements.</p>

<DESC>This announcement was previously posted under solicitation number <strong>W91CRB-15-R-0047</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (GEN II ABS) - for PEO Soldier</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W91CRB-16-R-0002</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on an unrestricted, full and open procurement using procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier), Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has a requirement for Gen II ABS systems. The current Advanced Bomb Suit (ABS) ensemble, consisting of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 8 bomb suit and EOD 9 Gen 2 helmet, is too heavy/bulky, restricts mobility and dexterity, and has limited sizing for full body protection and efficient utilization for US Army EOD Soldiers. Further, the current ABS lacks an effective integrated cooling system capability.</p>
<p>In response to the constantly changing and increased threats encountered, the Army has identified a need to improve and redesign the ABS ensemble to provide not only a higher level of protection, but also to improve the mobility and capability of the EOD Soldier. The Army will be seeking improvements to the helmet and suit of the ABS as a system and, individually. Further it is important to highlight that the Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (Gen II ABS) is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI), which asks Industry to propose existing, complete designs that are either in production or waiting for a requirement to begin production.</p>
<p>The US Army intends to place the best available Non-Developmental GEN II ABS in the hands of the Warfighter as quickly as possible. The Solicitation will use Best Value with Price Tradeoff were Soldiers feedback is significantly more important than price. Industry designs with no Government design participation will be exclusively evaluated for this program. Executed in two phases, Evaluation (Phase 1) and Production (Phase 2), this solicitation will support the evaluation of multiple designs and allow Soldiers to select the highest rated system to receive FAT approval.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Production will be executed as a requirements contract with an estimated initial quantity of 153 (10% of the ABS Army Acquisition Objective) systems and estimated maximum quantity of 1,538 (full AAO) systems.</p>
<p>A reduction in weight, improved sizing tariff, and integrated cooling capability are the focus of this improvement effort. The number one objective of the Gen II ABS is to reduce weight while improving form, fit, and function. To achieve this, new ballistic, fragmentation, and blast protection materials offer the potential for significant weight reduction while providing the same level of protection or better. Further, the Army is seeking an expanded sizing tariff for the helmet and suit to improve the fit and function for each EOD Soldier. Finally, the Army is seeking to leverage dramatic improvements in cooling system technology by incorporating an enhanced integrated cooling system into the suit.</p>
<p>Based upon these requirements, the following improvements are proposed as they have potential to provide immediate impact for EOD Soldiers:</p>
<p>&bull; Weight: The weight and weight distribution of the ABS ensemble must not significantly impede mission efficiency. The current ABS weighs 74 pounds for a size medium. The objective for the GEN II ABS is to reduce the weight of the current ABS by approximately 15% to 40%</p>
<p>&bull; Size: A lack of proper sizing increases the ABS' system weight issue. Currently there are only four sizes for the ABS suit (small, medium-small, medium and large) and a single helmet with a series of adjustment pads to fit the full sizing tariff. Updated anthropometric data on the US Army Soldier population indicates the need for new sizing. Specifically the Gen II ABS shall be designed to accommodate the full range of user personnel, i.e., 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male for full body protection and efficient utilization by EOD Soldiers.</p>
<p>&bull; Improved Cooling System. EOD technicians require an integrated cooling system to keep core body temperatures within normal range in hot environments. Prolonged exposure to high physical output and temperatures rapidly degrades the operator's ability to effectively perform their duties. The current ABS cooling system is not integrated (adds time to don/doff) and is dependent upon readily available ice in order to provide temperature cooling inside of the bomb suit. Both of these inherent design characteristics make the system unfavorable for Soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span>:</p>
<p>The Gen II ABS system, in any of its configurations, is considered a critical safety item (CSI). All items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding up three (3) FFP contracts, one contract per system design under Phase One, and one (1) FFP Requirements contract with a four (4) year ordering period under Phase Two. Awards will be made to the best overall proposals (Best Value), which are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.</p>

<DESC>Work is located at the Fontenelle Dam Power Plant approximately 24 miles southeast of La Barge, Wyoming, in Lincoln and Sweetwater Counties.  
The work to be done on the existing Fontenelle pilot static excitation system is to design and install a new digital front-end controller.  The criteria to be met are as follows:
1.	Currently the voltage source is the station service.  This is being changed to the generator terminals under a separate contract.  
2.	Implement existing field flashing startup energy hardware, wiring and system.  Modify and document existing system as required.
3.	Bridges, breakers, and other hardware are to be unaltered as much as possible.
4.	Furnish and install an intuitive, user friendly touch-screen operator interface terminal at excitation system cubicle location.  It will provide the minimum data displayed on the existing operator interface terminal and meet the below requirements.   Provide an IRIG-B compatible oscillography.  Provide a Modbus (TCP or RTU mode), Ethernet or RS-232 serial interface for communication with SCADA.  The Modbus register map shall provide analog input and holding registers in integer format.  Provide any data format conversion hardware required for SCADA communication interface.    The interface terminal will also show detailed excitation alarms.
5.	Field installation and commissioning of the software and operational verification of the proper functioning of the generator system start, run, stop and restart.  This includes the coordination of the excitation overexcitation, underexcitation, and volts/hertz limiters with new digital protective relays being commissioned at the same time.
6.	Provide manufacturers documentation of the new control system
7.	Provide two (2) hard copies of the software for backup purposes.  The Contractor will grant the Government a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use any Contractor software related documentation which may be included as part of, integrated into, or necessary for the proper function of the excitation system modifications included in this statement of work.
8.	The control should provide means of regular testing and maintenance of the entire excitation system.
9.	The excitation system must meet or exceed all current functionality once completed.  
10.	All installed wires and cabling will be bundled, routed, and labeled in an orderly and professional manner.
11.	As-built Government format drawings similar to existing excitation system wiring diagrams, schematic diagrams, and single-line diagrams.
12.	Comply with NFPA 70 and IEEE 421.

Work must be coordinated with the contractor replacing the unit breaker.  Installation and commissioning of the new controller is anticipated for the fall of 2016.

<DESC>The Architect Engineer (AE) firm shall provide architectural and design services necessary to furnish: Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Technical Specifications, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, Cost Estimates, As-Built Documentation, and all other related information for the Project 506-16-101, Upgrade Automatic Transfer Switch System AE Design at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System in Ann Arbor, MI as described below:
 
Scope of project:
 
1.	The consultant shall provide all necessary architectural and engineering (A-E) design services as required to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports, and cost estimates, including services throughout construction for Upgrade Automatic Transfer Switch System,  Project # 506-16-101 at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. Work shall include all site work, utility connections, communication wiring and connection as well as any disruptions to existing systems.  

a.	Project will upgrade or replace the ATS system throughout the Medical Center. Resulting upgrades will include total network capability, total isolated bypass, and replacement of older ATS units that are not capable of being upgraded, installation of central monitoring capabilities, and other upgrades necessary to bring the system up to the latest standards.
 
2.	  The selected firm will be required to fully evaluate the existing and present conditions.  They will be required to review any background documents, asbestos survey and lead assessments of the existing area, original drawings, and other information in the VA engineering office for information related to their design.  The firm is welcome to make copies at the engineering office of any documents and drawings.  The engineering section will transfer any electronic documents to a FTP type site the AE has set up.  Many times drawing files are too large to transfer via email.  It is the intent of the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the A-E survey the existing conditions and not rely solely on old background drawings for their design.  The VA makes no guarantee to the accuracy of background drawings, as most of the drawings are copies of original construction drawings and not "As Built" in nature.  The VA does complete regular asbestos and lead assessments and believes these to be accurate.  The AE will have full access to these surveys. 

Note: A/E shall be responsible for conducting site visits for the purpose of data gathering, investigation and documentation of all existing conditions.  Perform such investigations as required to accurately verify all existing conditions.  Do not rely solely upon "as built" drawings.  VA personnel will provide assistance with investigating the project site where prior experience with equipment and utilities will produce an appreciable advantage.

In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction price range is estimated to be between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.
 
Prospective firms are required to address all selection criteria within submitted SF330 packages using additional pages as required. Selection criteria shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836.602-1 as follows:

(1) Professional Qualifications: the qualifications of the individuals which will be used for these services will be examined for experience and education and their record of working together as a team. The specific disciplines which will be evaluated are architectural, engineering, and estimating.

(2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  specific experience and technical skill in the type and scope of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

(3) Capacity to Accomplish the Work: the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office which will be responsible for the majority of the design and the ability to accomplish the work in the required time will be evaluated. 

(4) Past Performance: the past performance of the firm on contracts relevant in scope to the advertised project that were accomplished with the Department of Veterans Affairs, other Government agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be examined. Project past performance references older than 5 years will receive a lesser score than those references for projects accomplished within the past 5 years. 

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 350 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 350 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion.

 (6) Claims and Terminations: record of significant claims against the firm or terminated contracts because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services will be examined.

(7) Reputation in A-E Community: reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project: and their record of working together as a team.

<DESC>This is an open solicitation notice for Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) for&nbsp;Neutron Guides&nbsp;for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). This requirement is competed using full and open competition. <br /><br />This requirement concerns the acquisition of neutron guides which are used as a conduit for a stream of cold neutrons originating near the core of the reactor operated by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). In much the same manner as a fiber optic cable carries light rays, the guides channel the neutrons away from the source and carry them to a location where they are they are used to probe matter in one of the many neutron-scattering spectrometers at the NCNR. The interior is coated with a neutron-reflective material to maximize the transmission of neutrons by allowing those making contact with the interior surfaces at incident angles below a characteristic angle to be reflected and continue downstream toward the desired destination.&nbsp; The characteristic angle and reflection efficiency are functions of the reflective surface and coating properties and the energy of the incident neutron. <br /><br />NIST intends to compete future orders among the existing BOAs (including any BOAs awarded as a result of this notice) on a lowest price, technically acceptable basis. Orders will be firm-fixed-price. At this time, there are three BOA holders for the period beginning June 30, 2015 through June 29, 2016. The BOAs include option years which, if exercised, may extend them through June 29, 2020. The three BOAs described above were competed via full and open competition and awarded on a competitive basis in June 2015. The solicitation, all associated documentation, and amendments were posted to www.fedbizopps.gov under solicitation number SB1341-15-RP-0006.<br /><br />Interested parties with the capability to provide&nbsp;the stated&nbsp;services may respond to this notice with a written statement of capability. This capability statement shall identify the business size/designation (e.g. small, small disadvantaged, minority owned, 8(a), other than small, etc. utilizing NAICS code 334516) with sufficient information that demonstrates its ability to fulfill the above requirements. <br /><br />The capability statement should provide the following information:
<p>1. The company name, address, phone number, and email address(es) for point(s) of contact.</p>
<p>2. A detailed description of Neutron Guide fabrications performed by your company as a prime contractor or subcontractor within the past 10 years. Include contract/order number, period of performance, and total dollar amount of the contract/order and customer point(s) of contact (name, phone number, email address).</p>
<p>3. The size of your company in terms of total current number of employees under NAICS code 334516. If your company is a subsidiary of another company, list the total revenue and number of employees for the parent organization and all subsidiaries. Please indicate if your company is an 8(a) concern, a HUBZone small business concern or a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business under this NAICS code.</p>
<p>4. The company's DUN S number. Also please indicate whether the company is <br />currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (www.ccr.gov). CCR registration is mandatory to receive an award of any government contractual vehicle.</p>
<p>Responses shall not exceed 15 pages and shall include the subject line "Neutron Guide BOA". Mere expressions of interest without providing the above requested details will not be considered a valid response to this notice.<br /><br />The statement of capability will be reviewed by the NIST Technical Team to determine if they provide the requested details above, as well as sufficiently detailed description of Neutron Guide Fabrication capabilities similar in scope and complexity to the types of&nbsp;Neutron Guide requirements&nbsp;described in this statement.<br /><br />The statement of capability may be followed by a Request for Proposal package which will require the interested party's complete proposal in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation. The party shall be permitted 45 days to respond to the request for proposal. The RFP would reflect all of the requirements of SB1341-15-RP-0006 updated with clauses and provisions in effect on the date the Government issues the RFP to a prospective Contractor.<br /><br />NIST will evaluate the Contractor's proposal in accordance with the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation. Parties determined capable of performing the required work may be issued a Basic Ordering Agreement and would have the opportunity to compete for future orders. This notice shall remain open continuously throughout the period of performance of the original Basic Ordering Agreements. <br /><br />This notice will be amended on a&nbsp;bi-annual basis, in order to provide specific notice of the number of solicitations for BOA orders issued within that period, and to update the cumulative award amount. In no event will the cumulative orders placed under the BOAs exceed $4,900,000.00.</p>

There was some confusion relating to the mileage restriction included in this procurement. 

This amendment is hereby provided to reduce the confusion. This procurement is restricted to Small Business (SB) firms located within a 350 mile radius of the Ann Arbor VA Health Care System, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2303.  

"This mileage restriction is in Compliance with VAAR 805.207(b)".    

In order to fully clarify this we revised the following Evaluation Factor related to geographic location. Evaluation Factor Number Five currently reads: 

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 350 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 350 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion.

Evaluation Factor Number Five has been revised to read as follows:  

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. Scoring will be based off of the proposed location of the Prime Contractor Firm for this category and scoring shall be as follows:  within 50 miles - Excellent (Blue); 51-100 miles - Very Good (Green); 101-150 - Acceptable (Yellow); 151-200 - Marginal (Orange); 201-250:  ; 251-350 - Poor (Red).

<DESC>Under the modification covered by this J&A, Ridgewood will perform additional engineering to integrate application hosting and to address cybersecurity requirements. The objective of the contract is to obtain the full range of systems engineering, software upgrades, program management, functional integration, and sustainment services to assist and support PMW-205 to complete modifications to COMPASS. The vendor shall provide software updates, software integration and testing, system administration and full life cycle support for the COMPASS Application. The contract as-written provides coverage through September 29, 2016. The modification covered by this J&A increases the value of the contract by $453,222 but does not extend the period of performance. Additional effort is required due to unanticipated work complexities associated with the NGEN Re-Compete RFIs, application hosting, and cybersecurity requirements.
The contract modification was awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 230-4(c)(1). The contract action includes services for which the Government negotiated with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.
