<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) intends to issue a sole-source award to American Tower Corporation of Woburn, MA for antenna sites renewals at multiple locations throughout the United States.  This notice is not a request for proposal.  Selection of the antenna site was based on results of a site survey, which is on file in the Wireless Communications Section.  These sites were selected based on the following criteria:  (1) provides the maximum transmit and receives coverage range for clear as well as encrypted transmissions; (2) provides minimal interference on receive frequency; and (3) provides the best level of safety for ATF agents in the field.  Based on the survey, these sites are the only sites that will meet ATFs Law Enforcement radio communication coverage needs.  ATF supports and maintains a Private Land Mobile (LMR) system to provide the administrative and tactical radio communications used in support of ATFs investigations and special events. To support the infrastructure needs of this LMR system, ATFs communications equipment is installed and housed in various locations throughout the continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Alaska. These locations can be either remote tower sites in rural or mountainous areas or building facilities within a metropolitan city. These locations where ATF is charged a fee to house our communications equipment a yearly site lease is established to pay for this service and renewed yearly as long as the LMR coverage is needed to support ATF operations.  The primary requirement for antenna sites is geographical location (Does that site location provide the LMR coverage needed to fulfill the Field Division area of operation). Other factors are taken into consideration when multiple locations can provide the coverage requirements.  They are:  1)  Housing facility (AC Power/HVAC/Space/Security); 2) Tower Height; 3) RF Noise Level/Interference; 4) Site Access; 5) Telco Access; and 6) Cost.

These standards can be found at the following web site: http://www.access-board.gov/ada-aba/final.cfm. In addition, the hotel must have done an excellent job of integrating the access into the general design of the hotel. For example, there cannot be a separate entrance that is accessible for people with disabilities but rarely used by people without disabilities. Access Board staff will make a determination whether the hotel most closely meets the standards. <br />2. The hotel must have sleeping rooms that are accessible to people who are deaf, or the hotel must have the required portable equipment.</p>
<p>The Board will pay special attention to the accessibility, specifically the guest room bathrooms, in its determination of whether or not the hotel meets the ADA Accessibility Standards.

<CONTACT>Stephanie F Alexander, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 202-344-1168, Fax 202-344-1254, Email stephanie.alexander@dhs.gov
<DESC>Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), intends to issue a modification against Contract HSBP1008C01859, for the continuation of operational and maintenance support services for CBPs Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Predator B aircrafts.  These services consist of procuring air vehicle operators and mission payload operators, systems airframe and equipment repairs/modification, system upgrades or engineering changes, software support services, air vehicle and mission equipment systems integration, training, material and equipment support issues resolution and technical support services, maintaining support of ground station facilities, material and equipment procurement services, and data development and documentation.   These services will be procured on a sole source basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), 16761 Via Del Campo Court, San Diego, CA  92127.  The anticipated contract period will be from date of award through 31 December 2009.  

GA-ASI is the sole capable prime contractor for the UAS Predator B Program.  Because the MQ-9 Predator B is proprietary to GA-ASI, no other company can produce this particular aircraft nor can any other company support, operate, and maintain the CBP program at the anticipated levels that are forecasted for the future. The Predator B cannot be procured from any other source, and the attempt to transition the support services for the Predator B to a company other than GA-ASI would be impractical. No other company has the capacity like GA-ASI nor the knowledge to support the UAS program that CBP has developed. GA-ASI knowledge of the operation and maintenance of the Predator B is unique as well as their knowledge of CBP UAS program. The acquisition of any other system and services irreparably impact the CBP UAS program, cause a decrease in security at the Nations borders and cause costly delays in the CBP UAS deployment schedule. Based on these reasons, and combined with unchanged CBP UAS operational requirements as well as CBP A&Ms own ongoing research of the UAS market, GA-ASI is the one responsible source for the UAS aircraft equipment and support services required by CBP and no other supplies or services will satisfy these requirements.

In August 2005, CBP awarded GA-ASI a contract for four (4) Predator B UASs. The award was based on a competitive procurement process during which the GA-ASI Predator B, with its long duration, high altitude, and persistent surveillance capability, as well as expanded payload capabilities and an agile transportability feature, emerged as the one system that met all of CBPs operational requirements. Due to the lack of a government infrastructure to support a UAS system, GA-ASI installed, integrated, operated, and continues to operate and maintain the Predator B for CBP.

The Predator B provides the following Level I requirements:
- Remotely piloted vehicle that meets FAA control restrictions
- Capable of long range surveillance and intelligence gathering, endurance
o Flexible C3ISR
o 2200 lb payload capacity
o 30 hour flight time
o Pilot in the loop
- Capable of providing direct support for ground interdiction
- Meets stringent FAA requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
o FAA review of requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
o Only UAS to receive FAA approval of Air Worthiness Statement (November 2006)
o Extensive Ground and Flight Testing
- Only UAS proven in the NAS 
- Payload capacity makes it capable of supporting growth in sensor technology
- U.S. military applications of the Predator B enable CBP to leverage inter-agency technology, training, logistics and maintenance support
- GA-ASI integrated, and currently operates and maintains the Predator B for CBP

GA-ASI UAS aircraft and equipment have had to meet CBP UAS performance measures (e.g., system availability rates) and its support services have had to meet service contract requirements. GA-ASI continues to meet or exceed CBP requirements in performance and reliability. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants CBP A&M a Certificate of Authorization (COA) for Predator B operations to fly in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS), in part because of its safety record operating within the NAS. In fact, the Predator B has more hours within the NAS than any other airframe.

GA-ASI successfully and satisfactorily supports CBP UAS operations. A service provider other than GA-ASI would lack commonality with the currently deployed CBP UAS and cause a lengthy operation downtime during testing, selection, and transition phases, as well as a reinvestment for integration and training. The unavoidable grounding of Predator B operations during transition would mean a significant interruption in support to CBP agents in the southwest border region, a decrease in CBPs ability to support its in homeland security, and a costly in CBPs northern border expansion efforts,

Since taking delivery of CBP 104 in September 2006, the GA-ASI Predator B has been a force multiplier for CBP. During 2006 and 2007, Predator Bs flew approximately 2,000 hours in support of CBP southwest border security missions. This flexible and responsive system will also allow CBP to coordinate with organizations that share similar missions, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense (DoD). CBP A&M works with the DoD to gain efficiencies in acquisition, testing, training and deployment of the Predator B.

GA-ASI Predator Bs provide unique and specialized intelligence gathering, surveillance and tactical support to CBP agents on the ground in the southwest border region and will add much needed support to northern border operations. CBP UAS operations must continue uninterrupted; this is only possible with the UAS aircraft equipment and ongoing support services of GA-ASI.Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GA-ASI directly.  See Numbered Note 22.

They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>DOS A/LM/AQM Memorandum dated 04/23/08: GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>41 USCode 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on Fedbid.  All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>Please see attachment for detailed summary of installation.<BR><BR>41 USCode 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the FedBid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office announces the intent to contract directly with Bearing Point, Inc of McLean, VA for a requirement for a Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Support in support of the Department of the Navy Program Budget Information System (PBIS).
Under Contract Number N00140-06-D-0006, Bearing Point is currently providing the same services to support PBIS, PBIS Enhanced Operations, and PBIS Budget Applications. The final ordering period under the contract expires on 31 October 2009.  The existing ceiling is inadequate to accomplish the required PBIS O&M services through 31 October 2009; therefore, the Government intends to modify the existing contract to increase the estimated Level of Effort and the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) value of the Contract.
A modification to Contract N00140-06-D-0006 is in the best interest of the Government, as award to any other source would result in a duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfillment of the requirement.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.

Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Testing of Lighting Products Compliance with Energy
1.0 Background
The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to perform independent work that helps ensure the integrity of EPA programs and operations by promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.  In addition, the OIG seeks to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and mismanagement in Agency programs and operations.  
Energy Star is a joint program of the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helping to save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. In 1992, EPA introduced Energy Star as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy-efficient products to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Computers and monitors were the first labeled products.  To participate manufacturers self-certify that at a minimum, their products comply with the Energy Star specifications for that product.  Through 1995, EPA expanded the label to additional office equipment products and residential heating and cooling equipment. In 1996, EPA partnered with the DOE for particular product categories. The Energy Star label is now on major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. EPA has also extended the label to cover new homes, and commercial and industrial buildings.
The EPA OIG plans to select Energy Star qualified lighting products and have them tested to determine if they meet applicable Energy Star product specifications.  This independent testing will help to verify whether EPA's self-certification process provides reasonable assurance that test results provided by partners and others are representative.  
2.0 ScopeThe contractor shall provide any and all necessary personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and services to test lighting products designated as Energy Star to determine whether they meet the Energy Star specifications. All products will be procured by the OIG and remain the property of the OIG; and must be returned to the OIG upon completion of testing.  The contractor shall perform all tests in accordance with Energy Star testing methodologies located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  The contractor must be accredited by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).
The contractor must provide assurance that it has the resources to employ test methods specified by the Energy Star's Eligibility Criteria located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  for each product selected for testing.  The contractor must maintain the applicable certifications or specification requirements that are specified by Industry or by the Energy Star testing guidelines located at http://www.energystar.gov/.  The contractor shall provide personnel with background and expertise in areas germane to the objectives.2.1 Contractor Personnel
	2.11 Project Manager.  The contractor shall provide a project manager who shall be responsible for the performance of work and certified to oversee testing.  The name of this person, and an alternate who shall act for the contractor when the manager is absent, shall be designated in writing to the Contracting Officer and their representative. 	2.12 The project manager and alternate shall have full authority to act for the contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this contract.
	2.13 The project manager and alternate shall be available during normal business hours, with reasonable notice, to discuss the project.
2.2 Contractor Employees  
2.21 Before starting work under this contract, contract employees performing testing must have all applicable certification and/or specification requirements that are specified by Industry and/or by the Energy Star testing guidelines.  Proof of these certifications and statements that the personnel do not have a conflict of interest will be submitted to the Contracting Officer and their representative prior to starting work under this contract.
	2.22 Conflict Of Interest.  In order for the OIG to evaluate any potential conflict of interest, please disclose any and all Energy Star product testing performed for private manufacturers, Environmental Protection Agency, or Department of Energy within the last five years.  The selected vendor also cannot be currently employed by any of the above entities to perform work duplicative to that referenced in the PWS.  2.23 The contractor must provide proposed subcontractors and obtain approval prior to subcontracting out any testing required under this contract.  Subcontractors must meet the same requirements and standards as the prime described in the Performance Work Statement.
	2.24 The contractor shall not utilize the services of any person who is an employee of the U.S. Government if employing that person would create a conflict of interest in work performed under this contract.  
3.0 ObjectivesThe objective of this work is to test Energy Star lighting products to determine whether they comply with the Energy Star specifications for those products. Repeat testing may be requested for some products after initial test results are received.  In addition, other Energy Star products may be tested if OIG determines a need to do so.  This information will be used to protect Energy Star brand integrity and strengthen the EPA Energy Star's quality assurance program.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Philadelphia PA 19106. The period of performance is for a one-year period beginning January 22, 2009 through January 21, 2010. Under FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This requirement is utilizing procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with procedures under FAR Part 13.

Federal Reserve Bank is the only known source capable of providing the required annual software support and technical capabilities for the referenced software product. SSA has had an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), which established a direct electronic link for the exchange of payment-related information (i.e., automated enrollments, notifications of change and death notification entries) since 1993.  The FRB is the only source of this service.  The Federal Reserve which is the fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, processes all electronic payments on behalf of the U.S. Government, including SSA, through the nations automated clearing house (ACH) network. The ACH, which is operated by the FRB, is the computer network used by financial institutions to transmit credits and debits. SSA transmits tens of millions of payment-related transactions through the ACH each month in order to make direct deposit payments into beneficiaries bank accounts as well as to transmit other critical payment-related information affecting beneficiaries payments.   

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement. Any vendor capable of performing the preceding requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by 12:00pm EST January 15, 2009. If no affirmative, responses are received within 3 business days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) negotiations will be conducted with the Federal Reserve Bank, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br />Requirement</p>
<p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron (AETC CONS) has a requirement to strategically source refuse collection and recycling services at 18 bases within the command and across the Southwest Region. The total estimated annual refuse tonnage is 60,000 tons. A breakdown of bases where services are to be performed along with estimated annual tonnages is included at Attachment #1. The two services are to be combined into one Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) program. The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services necessary to conduct a Resource Management approach to ISWM. Additionally, the ISWM service provider must comply with all federal and DoD regulations for waste stream diversion and mandatory materials recycling.</p>
<p>Description of Services</p>
<p>To perform effective Resource Management, the contractor must be able to minimize refuse collection and disposal costs while maximizing recycling revenues through integration of the refuse and recycling programs. This shall be performed under the lead or guidance of the prime ISWM service provider. The primary or lead service provider shall make use of all available base resources to maximize recycling revenue and simultaneously divert recyclable materials from being disposed of into landfills. This will create cost avoidance in the refuse collection and disposal arena while simultaneously providing additional material for generating recycling revenue. The intent of the program is to create a self sufficient recycling program which can be provided at zero cost, with additional recycling revenue offsetting refuse collection and disposal costs. For more information on Resource Management/Integrated Solid Waste Management, visit the Environmental Protection Agency's respective website at: http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/wastewise/wrr/rm.htm</p>
<p>The service provider will be incentivized to reduce costs through a revenue sharing program with the Government. The service provider's final profit will be based upon recycling self sufficiency and a targeted reduction of landfill waste. The service provider will be allowed to use various methods to reduce landfill tonnages by creatively utilizing the solid waste for any application, with landfill disposal being the final option. All existing government equipment utilized for collecting and processing recyclable materials will be authorized. However, it is expected that the contractor will significantly expand the collection, segregation, and processing regime. <br />This service provider shall provide the services of refuse collection in a manner that meets or exceeds the standards as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The PWS is not available as of the publication date of this notice, but will be posted with the RFP along with all Appendices and Attachments.</p>

<SOLNBR>ICEOAQMDOPLA01120901
<RESPDATE>012609
<CONTACT>Lawrence M. Ayers, Contracting Officer, Phone 214-905-5496, Fax 214-905-5568, Email lawrence.ayers@dhs.gov
<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Principle Legal Advisor (OPLA) has a requirment for services to support their continuing legal education accreditation program. At this time we are seeking potential sources that have the capabilities and experience to handle the requirment listed. All interested parties should provide their complete company contact information to include point of contact and any information on company capabilities and experience as it relates to this requirement by fax or e-mail by the closing date of this notice to Lawrence Ayers, Contracting Officer, FAX 214-905-5568 or e-mail; lawrence.ayers@dhs.gov.  


Background 

OPLAs attorneys are required to remain licensed and in good standing in at least one jurisdiction.  Over 40 jurisdictions require attorney to obtain training or continuing legal education (CLEs) as part of licensure.  Each state determines the requisite number of hours or CLEs, if any, an attorney must acquire and determines how often an attorney must report satisfactory completion of the requisite number of hours continuing education.  For example, some states require 12 hours of continuing education per year with a yearly reporting requirement.  Deadline for reporting CLEs varies from state-to-state. 

OPLA conducts extensive training throughout the year for its attorneys.  OPLA seeks to receive CLE accreditation for its trainings or conferences where legal instruction sessions are conducted.  Ideally, OPLA would like pre-approval or pre-accreditation for its courses, meaning that a given training would have already been awarded a definite number of CLE credits from each state bar association before the beginning of the training.  In the alternative, post-course accreditation is sought. 

Services Sought

OPLA seeks a vendor capable of working with OPLA points of contact, (POCs), for its conferences/courses/trainings, (CCTs), and obtaining CLE accreditation for its CCTs.  First, this includes providing to, and then obtaining from OPLA, the necessary forms, information, and materials for submission to the state bar associations.  CCTs specific information packets could include:

1.	CCT Agenda.
2.	Speaker biographies.
3.	Representative course materials. 
4.	Specific materials relating to ethics/professional responsibility training.  
5.	Affidavit of Attendance (during training)
6.	Daily sign in/out sheets.

Second, the vendor assembles and submits the information packets to various state bar associations.  In the event a state bar association charged a processing application or filing fee, it would be the responsibility of the vendor to calculate and pay this expense.  These filing fees are costs to be borne by the vendor and should be considered in the cost of any bid for services. 

Third, the vendor provides OPLAs POCs with any needed state specific attendance sheets for the CCTs before the training.  If post-course accreditation is sought, these forms should be made available to the attendees from the vendor after approval from the state bar association.

Finally, the vendor issues certificates of attendance and/or state specific forms that the attendees need to complete at the conclusion of the CCTs.  The vendor reports attendance to the states bars which require such action by the program provider.   The vendor provides Certificates of Completion to each attendee after CLE approval is received from the state bar associations. This certificate may be provided via email.  

Generally, the vendor is expected to answer any follow up questions from the attendees and/or POCs, and check on the status of CLE applications.  At the discretion of the POC, the vendor will file an appeal of the CLE application with a state bar association.  

Example One:  Pre-Approval Course Accreditation

OPLA will sponsor the 2009 New Attorney Training in Dallas, Texas.  The POC sends the appropriate information in advance to the vendor, including the student roster which lists the states in which we seek CLE credits.  Prior to the training, the vendor completes the appropriate application forms, determines the number of credits to apply for, calculates the filing fees, and submits the final applications to each state bar association.  Based on the information submitted, the state bar grants the application and the course is pre-approved.  Approvals are sent to the vendor.  During the training, the attendees sign in and out of each session (per day) and submit Affidavits of Attendance at the end of the training.  Within three business days after the training ends, the POC sends the sign in sheets and Affidavits of Attendance to the vendor, who then electronically sends Certificates of Completion to each attendee.   The vendor reports attendee names to the appropriate state bar associations and provides support with any questions that may arise.  Finally, the vendor is responsible for tracking any states that denied the application and files a timely appeal at the discretion of the POC.  
 
Example Two:  Post-Approval Course Accreditation 

OPLA will sponsor the 2009 Trial Advocacy Training Program in Baltimore, Maryland.  Due to scheduling issues, the POC decides to apply for credit after the training has ended.  During the training, the POC gathers the sign in sheets and Affidavits of Attendance.  After the training, the POC sends this information, along with the agenda, speaker bios, course descriptions, etc., to the vendor.  The vendor completes the appropriate application forms, determines the number of credits to apply for, calculates the filing fees, and submits the final applications to each state bar association.  Based on the information submitted, the state bar grants the application and the course is approved.  Approvals are sent to the vendor.  The vendor reports attendee names to the appropriate state bar associations and provides support with any questions or appeals that may arise.  Finally, the vendor is responsible for tracking any states that denied the application and files a timely appeal at the discretion of the POC.  




OPLA as an Approved Provider 

OPLA seeks to achieve, Approved Provider or Approved Sponsor or similar status with state bar associations.  Requirements for such status vary from state-to-state.  The vendor would be expected to obtain this status for OPLA as soon as possible from all states and territories which grant this status.  If this process requires keeping and recording data on OPLA sponsored events and accreditation, the vendor would be expected to do so.  At the earliest possible time for making the application, the vendor would be expected to apply for the status.  All costs associated with seeking this status and any subsequent costs associated with obtaining CLEs from states having granted OPLA this status would be borne by the vendor during the contract period.  

Example:  Illinois Accredited CLE Provider

The Illinois Minimum Continuing Legal Education Board may grant Accredited CLE Provider status to providers who establish: 

it has presented, within the past two years, at least five separate courses or activities of CLE which meet the standards of the MCLE rules, and the Boards Provider FAQ; or  

its CLE courses or activities have consistently met the MCLE Rules and the Boards standards set in the Boards Provider FAQs.

<SUBJECT>19--RFI for the Future Generation Submarine Thin Line Towed Array
<SOLNBR>N0002409N6224
<RESPDATE>021009
<ARCHDATE>02252009
<CONTACT>Phil Paquin202-781-1164philip.paquin@navy.mil
Jason Simpson202-781-2743 jason.w.simpson@navy.mil
<DESC>SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for the Future Generation Thin Line Towed Array for Submarine employment that will continue to provide the equivalent acoustic performance of the legacy, TB-29A, array with significantly improved reliability performance.
PURPOSE: The Navy is interested in soliciting industry for concepts and proposed plans of action to address the Submarine Fleet's requirement for a highly reliable Thin Line towed array.  The Navy is considering the award of up to 3 competitive contract awards for prototype systems to support a production procurement decision in Fiscal Year 2010.
BACKGROUND:  The Future Generation Thin Line Towed Array (FG-TLTA) is anticipated to be the replacement for the legacy TB-29A and TB-23 Thin Line towed arrays.  It will serve as the primary passive sensor for the AN/BQQ-10(V) sonar system.  This capability is needed for submarine platforms including all SSN688 (Los Angeles), SSN21 (Seawolf), SSN774 (Virginia), and SSGN classes.  Since the deployment of the TB-29A array to the fleet in 2002, through Navy and Industry investments, the technology to field an affordable Thin Line array with the opportunity for better reliability performance has dramatically matured.  The Navy is interested in industry's approach for implementing these new technologies in the submarine Thin Line Towed Array application to assure fleet mission requirements are met over a sustained period of time.
The FG-TLTA hardware delivered at the completion of any contract award may be used by the Navy in a competition against other FG-TLTA concepts.  The Navy may award a contract for production if it determines that production is warranted.  If more than one vendor's FG-TLTA meets the requirements and supports the production schedule, the Government may either conduct a limited competition or award limited production quantities to multiple vendors.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  These general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:  
COST:  Life Cycle Costs of the FG-TLTA will be required to meet the constraints of the existing Program of Record for development, procurement, and sustainment of legacy Thin Line towed arrays.  The Navy is interested in innovative concepts associated with the FG-TLTA which will lower life cycle costs.  The Navy will evaluate key attributes of (1) tradeoffs between performance and reliability with cost as an independent variable (2) development costs including a technology readiness assessment, (3) procurement costs including non-developmental items and overall production readiness, and (4) support costs including the extent the FG-TLTA concept will leverage the Navy existing support infrastructure or alternatives which may result in cost savings.  Additionally, the cost impact of ship integration will be evaluated including changes such as AN/BQQ-10(V) software and hardware updates, and handling system impacts.  
SCHEDULE:. The Navy is interested in fielding a FG-TLTA system within 18 months of any contract award.  This initial system must be delivered to the Navy within 15 months to allow time for array self noise (acoustic performance) and reliability testing prior to a ship installation.  As such, the proposed technology must be at a readiness level which supports immediate transition to a production environment  (see http://www.cttso.gov/techtrans/TRLDefinitions.pdf for guidance on assessing technology readiness)  To mitigate any schedule risk, the Navy will consider options to field a partial capability, within 18 months, while design certification and final development supporting a full system is executed in parallel.  To support production requirements, the proposed FG-TLTA concept must be capable of a 12 month or less lead time.  To evaluate this attribute, the Navy will consider the vendor's approach to production planning including material lead time, personnel, facilities,!  and the use of matured subsystems, work processes and components.
PERFORMANCE: The FG-TLTA (including the towed array, towcable, and any additional outboard signal path components) will be required to perform in the operational conditions associated with all Submarine classes.  Specific key requirement are as follows:
A)	Operating Conditions - Pressure: The FG-TLTA will be required to operate over the same operational depths of the submarine.
B)	Operating Conditions - Vibration:  In addition to the MIL-STD-167A shipboard and transportation vibration requirements, the FG-TLTA will be required to operate and survive vibrations associated with towing conditions during SSN high speed maneuvers.  Recent testing with an Instrumented Thin Line array measured vibrations during ship maneuvers up to 1000 times greater than straight line towing.  These levels and a summary of this testing are available in NUWC-NPT Technical Report 11,772, which is being converted into a specification for future procurements.
C)	Operating Conditions - Temperature: The FG-TLTA will be required to survive in extreme weather conditions and rapid changes in temperature.  Stowage, or non-operational, temperatures range from -40o C to as high as +60 o C.  Temperatures during operating conditions range from -2oC to 40oC.  In addition, the FG-TLTA must survive rapid change in temperature such as changes associated with submergence in extremely cold and warm environments.
D)	Interface - Handling System:  The FG-TLTA will interface physically, mechanically, electrically and/or optically with the OA-9070 series (SSN688/Virginia Classes), OK-634 (Seawolf Class), and OK-542 (SSGN) towed array handling systems. The deployment, streaming, retrieval, and stowage conditions imposed by the handling system are summarized as follows:
.	Tension during deployment and retrieval - Up to 550 lbs while subjected to an 18 inch bend radius..	Over the life of the FG-TLTA it will be subjected to 500 deployment/retrieval cycles on the dual capstan handling system and stowed under tensions of 220 lbs.
A summary of all forces imparted by the handling system can be found in NUWC-NPT TM 972142D.	E)	Interface - Host Sonar System: The FG-TLTA is required to have an output signal in a data format compatible with the existing AN/BQQ-10(V) sonar system.  The NAVSEA Common-Spec-01 Rev. E, 1 April 2003, "Common Specification for Submarine Sonar, Combat Control, and Architecture Sub-Systems" can be used as guidance to determine AN/BQQ-10(V) compatibility requirements.  Note that the NAVY anticipates minimal changes to the host sonar system software and hardware may be required to support impacts due to new performance monitoring/fault localization characteristics, impacts due to non-acoustic sensor locations, or interface hardware.  Any required hardware changes are expected to be within the scope to the AN/BQQ-10(V) modernization, (i.e. no additional FG-TLTA-specific SHIPALTs are anticipated).
F)	Performance - Reliability: Reliability performance is required to be significantly improved over TB-29A performance.  If a solicitation were to be issued for a Future Generation Thin Line Towed Array, the evaluation may consist of the following:  For the concepts phase, a side- by-side comparison with the TB-29A array may be performed to evaluate the potential reliability improvement.  The proposed FG-TLTA design may be evaluated for (1) how well the known failure modes of the TB-29A are mitigated and for (2) the introduction of any new failure modes.  A summary of the failure modes associated with legacy thin line towed arrays can be found in the "TOWED SYSTEMS Reliability Performance" briefing dated 20 March 2008.   In addition, prototype testing may be performed to support an initial assessment of reliability performance.  This would include Mechanical Endurance testing and environmental testing where the FG-TLTA hardware including any new or modified outboard signal p! ath components will be subjected to forces associated with the full submarine operating environment.  This may include the following:
.	At least 500 deployment and retrieval cycles on a land-based Towed Array handling system.	Tension cycles simulating flank SSN speed towing.	Pressure cycles associated with the submarine operational depth envelope.	Temperature cycles associated with submarine operational and stowage environment per paragraph C above .	Vibrations associated with transportation, straight-line towing, and ship maneuvers per paragraph B above G)	Performance - Acoustic Self-Noise: The acoustic performance of the FG-TLTA shall be equivalent to the TB-29A performance requirement.  Specifically, this performance is documented in SHIPS-T-5974A Rev C.  Lower level requirements such as channel-to-channel gain and phase, crosstalk, electronic noise floor, etc are expected to support the array's compliant acoustic self-noise performance.  Acoustic performance will be evaluated prior to initial ship installation.  H)	Performance - Non-acoustic sensors: The non-acoustic sensors employed by the FG-TLTA are required to enable the bearing accuracy equivalent to the TB-29A-AN/BQQ-10(V) system.  This function is supported by the TB-29A array with heading and depth sensor spaced across the array in 6 locations.  The Navy is interested in innovative approaches to reduce the procurement and support costs and improve the reliability of these sensors while maintaining the host sonar system's bearing accuracy performance.

<DESC>In January 2006, the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) and the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), San Diego, used Strategic Sourcing methodologies to successfully award two Nationwide Department of Navy (DoN) best-value solutions for the purchase of office supplies and materials.  These solutions provided DoN Customers office supplies, printer toner cartridges and supplies, janitorial/sanitation supplies, industrial tools, and galley supplies and equipment.  Historically, these supplies and materials are those items the Navy customarily obtained through ServMarts. These contracts have exceeded estimated savings, especially on the costs of many high demand office supply products.  In addition to realized cost-savings, other key benefits included just-in-time delivery features for ship and shore installations-- offering pier-to-pier and desk-top delivery within 24 hours; and the ease of placing orders electronically via the DoD E-Mall or vendor created websit! es (the Virtual ServMarts).  
In an effort to continue providing DoN Customers a best-price/best-value solution for the acquisition of office supplies, we are seeking industry answers to assist in outlining a best business approach.  
Interested parties are asked to review and answer the questions on the attached document.

<DESC><p>Description:&nbsp; This is not a request for proposal. The Alaska District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeks industry input on in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) of diesel range organics (DRO) remediation techniques in soil and groundwater. The remoteness of the job site poses unique problems, so please read the summary below prior to formulating a response.</p>
<p>Project Summary:</p>
<p>Main Operations Complex: 28,000 cubic yards of DRO-contaminated soil and associated groundwater contamination<br />Site 28 Drainage Basin: 15,000 cubic yards of DRO, metals, PCB-contaminated soil/sediment</p>
<p>Contamination occurs in soils at the surface down to a depth of 20 feet, and in sediments in an active, shallow, narrow stream and a shallow intermittent pond.</p>
<p>A small area should be used as a "Pilot Study" to assess amenability to ISCO.</p>
<p>Unconsolidated sediments are glacially derived, silty sand, poorly-sorted sand, to silty gravel. There are some peat horizons at depth. The rocks making up the gravel are granitic and angular. Wells are readily advanced with some difficulty (rocks). The water table is about 12 feet deep in the contaminated area of the Main Operations Complex, becoming very shallow into the Drainage Basin wetlands to the north. The groundwater flow direction for the water table is north/northwest. Hydraulic conductivity (K) typically ranges between 0.12 and 24 feet/day (avg. 6 ft/day). The thickness of the water table in the Main Complex varies between 3 and 7 feet. The groundwater is slightly acidic (5.4 - 6.6).</p>
<p>St. Lawrence Island is remote. There is neither electricity nor any services. Mobilization is typically by barge for larger equipment. There are some good dirt roads to be utilized and an air strip that has handled larger cargo planes (needs to be re-assessed).</p>
<p>In developing its strategy, the Alaska District would like industry comment on the following sets of questions:</p>
<p>Basic Candidate Screening Questions<br />(1) Please describe your business type and size. <br />(1) Have you ever used chemical oxidation technology? Was it successful?<br />(2) Do you think the technology is applicable to this remote Alaskan site?<br />(3) Would you be willing to submit a proposal to us for an ISCO study?</p>
<p>Detailed Technology Questions<br />(4) What specific site characteristics would you need to know?<br />(5) What type of in-situ chemical oxidation technology have you employed?<br />(6) Have you ever used Fenton's Reagent?</p>
<p>Information requested in this Special Notice shall be submitted by 4:00 pm Alaska Time on 30 Jan, 2009. Please reply via email to:<br />Dave Williams (R.David.Williams@usace.army.mil) or <br />Mary Abbott (Mary.J.Abbott@usace.army.mil)</p>

<DESC>Notes from Initial Walk ThroughCorrect Electrical DeficienciesDecember 30, 2008On Tuesday, 30th December we met in room BR-145 Engineering to discuss the Correct Electrical Deficiencies Project 618-07-303ES.  We discussed the scope of the project and paged through the drawings.Engineering clarified the change entitled Add Alternate #1.  The EDP-CENT2 should be physically connected to EDP-CENT gear and an extension of the bus.  It is not to be a separate gear that is fed off of EDP-CENT.  The pad is extend and gear added to match existing.  The reason for the change is that EDP-CENT will not accept an 800A breaker.  In addition, as part of Add Alternate #1 the government changed the three branch circuits run to 3K to the running of a feeder panel.We traveled to the generator room to look at the existing switch gear.  This is for Add Alternate #2.  In the space, there is also a shaft to the sub basement that would accommodate at the most a 40"x40" piece of equipment lowered to the sub basement.Second, BT-103 and to sub #2 in 1Q-118.Third, BD-101B and F and discussed drawing 1168-E16 of bldg 70.Fourth, sub 10 and the room below.Fifth, Building 9, rooms 13 and 14 including the current electric room setup and the future room setup.Sixth, Building 10 the transformer.  We discussed that the change out of the transformer would require night work and would probably take down both building 9 & 10.  Also, to include the removal of the old pad and installation of a new pad.Seventh, basement of bldg 10;  route to run the 4"emt.Eighth, showed where building 47 is located and offered to go for a look with no takers.  It's a simple 2x4 light retro to T-8's and electronic ballasts.  The government has since verified that the power to that building is 120/208.Ninth, panels in building 68; both 1st and 2nd floor.  Both spaces to be worked at night.End of the walk through with no more questions at that time.

Dr. Foote has extensive leadership experience broadly in neuroscience, and specifically in the area of autism. Dr. Foote has coordinated numerous autism research activities within NIH, across federal agencies, and in government partnerships with non-governmental organizations.

For example, in response to the Childrens Health Act, Dr. Foote was responsible for establishing a temporary advisory committee, which joined DHHS , other agencies and departments as well.  Dr. Foote has testified to Congress repeatedly on autism research issues that remain contentious and are still important focal points for NIH interactions with the advocacy community.  Additionally, Dr. Foote led the implementation of the congressionally mandated STAART centers program, which has a direct counterpart in the Combating Autism Act.  

Dr. Foote, will lead discussions with the Federal Advisory Committee and draft the scientific content of the strategic plan for the NIMH.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>41 USCode 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price request on FedBid.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.  Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>41 USCode 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price request on FedBid.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>

<p><br />Requirement</p>
<p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron (AETC CONS) has a requirement to strategically source refuse collection and recycling services at 18 bases within the command and across the Southwest Region. The total estimated annual refuse tonnage is 60,000 tons. A breakdown of bases where services are to be performed along with estimated annual tonnages is included at Attachment #1. The two services are to be combined into one Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) program. The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services necessary to conduct a Resource Management approach to ISWM. Additionally, the ISWM service provider must comply with all federal and DoD regulations for waste stream diversion and mandatory materials recycling.</p>
<p>Description of Services</p>
<p>To perform effective Resource Management, the contractor must be able to minimize refuse collection and disposal costs while maximizing recycling revenues through integration of the refuse and recycling programs. This shall be performed under the lead or guidance of the prime ISWM service provider. The primary or lead service provider shall make use of all available base resources to maximize recycling revenue and simultaneously divert recyclable materials from being disposed of into landfills. This will create cost avoidance in the refuse collection and disposal arena while simultaneously providing additional material for generating recycling revenue. The intent of the program is to create a self sufficient recycling program which can be provided at zero cost, with additional recycling revenue offsetting refuse collection and disposal costs. For more information on Resource Management/Integrated Solid Waste Management, visit the Environmental Protection Agency's respective website at: http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/wastewise/wrr/rm.htm</p>
<p>The service provider will be incentivized to reduce costs through a revenue sharing program with the Government. The service provider's final profit will be based upon recycling self sufficiency and a targeted reduction of landfill waste. The service provider will be allowed to use various methods to reduce landfill tonnages by creatively utilizing the solid waste for any application, with landfill disposal being the final option. All existing government equipment utilized for collecting and processing recyclable materials will be authorized. However, it is expected that the contractor will significantly expand the collection, segregation, and processing regime. <br />This service provider shall provide the services of refuse collection in a manner that meets or exceeds the standards as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The PWS is not available as of the publication date of this notice, but will be posted with the RFP along with all Appendices and Attachments.</p>

Original Posting:
The United States Postal Service, Great Lakes Facilities Service Office, is seeking to prequalify General Contractors for Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC)/Job Order Contracts (JOC) for repair and alterations projects within the Chicago and Northern IL Areas.     A Job Order Contract is an indefinite quantity contract in which the contractor will perform individual projects at different leased and owned postal service facilities within the stated geographic area.   Examples of interior work:   painting, installing stud/gypsum board walls, installing lockboxes, relocating HVAC ducts or electrical outlets, plaster repair, wood refinishing, floor replacement.     Examples of exterior work:   asphalt/concrete paving, installing sidewalks, curbs or gutters, excavation, waterproofing, roofing, decking, exterior painting, security fencing and landscaping.  This prequalification is for the Chicago and Northern IL Areas, consisting of zip codes areas: 600-603, 606-608, 610-611,  which include the following counties:  Cook, Lake, McHenry, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Ogle, Boone, Carroll, Jo Daviess, Lee, Stephenson, Whiteside Counties, and Winnebago.

General Contractors selected as being the most qualified will be placed on the JOC prequalification list for a five year period for only the area(s) identified in this solicitation.  Current JOC contractors with active contracts covering the Chicago and Northern IL Areas will NOT be considered for award at this time,  but may submit their qualifications for placement on the prequalification list for consideration in future awards.  Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for 5 years.

ONLY pre-qualified firms will be given the opportunity to submit proposals.  Proposals will consist of a management plan and price proposal or multiplier which will be applied to unit prices.   All unit prices are based on local labor, material and equipment prices including the current prevailing wages.  Your firm must be willing and able to work on all the projects that may occur within the geographical area of the award.  The contract is a unit price standard type arrangement for a one year base term with potentially four 1-year renewal options.    The initial contract amount is anticipated to be $1,000,000.    The contract amount may be increased, by modification and with an appropriate increase in bonding, up to a maximum of $9,500,000.   The guaranteed minimum work is $10,000.  The maximum amount of an individual work order is $750,000, with no minimum.     

An Evaluation Team, comprised of qualified Postal Service Employees will evaluate contractors based on their Contractor Qualification Statement submission.  Each Contractor Qualification Statement will be reviewed as a whole.  Minimum Requirements for Pre-qualification: (1)The contractor has an office located within one of the zip code ranges/counties listed or within 100 miles of the proposed work area(if submitting a request for consideration of a branch office, contractor must furnish the address and phone number of the main/home office), and can provide an administrative plan that demonstrates the ability to service the zip code ranges/counties to the approval of the contractor officer if the contractor does not have an office located within one of the zip code ranges/counties. (2) The contractor possess and can provide a valid contractors license for the zip codes/counties listed, or at a minimum provide a copy of the application to obtain such license(s) within the areas listed. (3) The contractor is able to provide documentation reflecting the bonding capability with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $2,500,000. (4) The company/firm has been in business under the current name for a minimum of five consecutive years. Contractors meeting the minimum requirements must complete and submit a Contractor Qualification Statement.  Minority-owned and Women-owned businesses participation is encouraged.   The Qualification Statement includes information on the following: background (pass/fail), eligibility (pass/fail), certification and affirmation (pass/fail), bonding information (pass/fail), financial capability (pass/fail), Indefinite Quantity Contract Experience (60 points), comparable experience (60 points), non-comparable experience (20 points), and safety (20 points) for a total maximum score of 160 points.  Contractors who do not receive full points for a particular section or fail certain other sections may still be eligible for prequalification. Contractor Qualification Statements will not be maintained or returned. Firms will not be reimbursed for any expense(s) incurred in developing their Contractor Qualification Statement. 

The Postal Service is conducting meetings to assist contractors in understanding the Prequalification process and in the completion of the Qualification Statement.   All interested contractors are encouraged to attend; however, attendance is not mandatory.

<DESC>This amendment number 01 makes the following changes:

The issuance date of the solicitation has been extended to January 23, 2009; the contract type has been revised from Time and Materials to Firm Fixed Price; the NAICS code has been changed to 541512; and the place of performance has been incorporated into the description.
______________________________________________________

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal for a full and open competition for the project titled, Westinghouse Simulator Re-Host.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price.  The anticipated period of performance for this contract is five (5) years which includes one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  

The Office of Human Resources Training and Development (HRTD), requires that the Westinghouse full-scope control room simulator be re-hosted from its current computer system to an industry-standard processor that will be on Intel or Intel-compatible processor technology.  The software shall run under either the Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems.  When complete, the simulator shall be capable of running all of the scenarios, plant evolutions, and simulated failures which can currently be run.  The objective is to improve long-term simulator maintainability and remove obsolete computer systems.

Specifically, the Contractor will do the following tasks:

	Replace the Westinghouse-provided executive system software with executive system software that is more compatible with current operating systems and software development utilities;

	The Contractor shall provide a suite of software tools that are used to develop and update the simulator mathematical models;

	The Contractor shall supply a replacement instructor station that is compatible with the new computer system and executive system and that has, as a minimum, the same capabilities as the existing instructor station;

	The Contractor shall supply the necessary hardware and software to interface with the present control bench board input/output (I/O) system; and 

	The Contractor shall approach this project, to the maximum extent possible, as a turn-key project.  

The place of performance will be partially at the Government site and the other half at the contractor's facility.

This requirement does not anticipate subcontracts; therefore a small business subcontracting plan is not required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e. large businesses, small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service disabled veteran-owned small business.

The preferred method of distributing the NRC Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov).  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and NRC bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission.  The Contracting Officer has enabled the, Interested Vendors List (IVL) feature in fbo.gov for offerors that are interested in teaming opportunities for this requirement.  

This solicitation will be posted on fbo.gov (The Government Point of Entry (GPE) on or around January 23, 2009.

The Solicitation number is revised from W15P7T-09-R-M-602 TO W15P7T-09-R-M602.  No other changes have been made to the notice.<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>The Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) program provides the army and other military services and government agencies with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from RCIEDs.  The CREW program is comprised of numerous systems, which fill a wide range of the electronic warfare requirements.  The CREW systems protect the members of U.S. forces operating in, or primarily stationed in Iraq, and Afghanistan in support of U.S. operations in the Global War on Terrorism including Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). <BR><BR>The Product Manager, CREW has identified the need for CLS Support for the AN/VLQ-14(V) 1, Mobile Multi Band Jammer (MMBJ) 2.1 System (approximately 3,000 Systems). Impact Science and Technology (IST), a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Force Protection Systems Division, is the developer and only manufacturer of the AN/VLQ-14(V)1 MMBJ 2.1 System.  This CLS requirement is based on a directive from the Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) that is the oversight authority for CREW product development and production.  JIEDDO has officially established that once the CREW systems (like the MMBJ) have completed fielding and are designated for transition to a particular service, then it becomes that services responsibility to support, sustain and maintain these systems.  Within the Army, PM CREW has been identified to become the service organization responsible to provide these critical and timely support functions for the MMBJ 2.1.       <BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM LCMC is conducting this market survey to determine price and availability from potential sources capable of fulfilling a 5 Year Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) effort.   The Government has a requirement for sustainment and contractor logistics support for the MMBJ 2.1 Systems (approximately 3,000 Systems).  The Government does not have a technical data package for the MMBJ. <BR><BR>This effort will include the following:<BR><BR>- Program Management <BR>The contractor shall provide monthly Program Management Reports, maintenance accountability database, threat level development and participate in IPRs with the Government for the duration of the contract<BR><BR>- Field Service Representatives:  These services are to be performed in Afghanistan and possibly other locations within SWA.

<DESC>**NOTE:  This is a modification to the market research\sources sought notice for the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Armys Mobile Multi Band Jammer (MMBJ) 2.1 Systems AN/VLQ-14(V)1 (approximately 3,000 Systems.  The solicitation number of W15P7T-09-R-M602 is incorrect.  The solicitation number for this action is W15P7T-09-R-M606.  There is no other change to this notice.<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>The Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) program provides the army and other military services and government agencies with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from RCIEDs.

This CLS requirement is based on a directive from the Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) that is the oversight authority for CREW product development and production.  JIEDDO has officially established that once the CREW systems (like the MMBJ) have completed fielding and are designated for transition to a particular service, then it becomes that services responsibility to support, sustain and maintain these systems.  Within the Army, PM CREW has been identified to become the service organization responsible to provide these critical and timely support functions for the MMBJ 2.1.       <BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM LCMC is conducting this market survey to determine price and availability from potential sources capable of fulfilling a 5 Year Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) effort.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Perform surveying, dredging and disposal of approximately 1,700,000 cubic yards of virgin materials plus an additional 3,800,000 cubic yards of fine-grained shoaled material.

Estimated Award Date of the Contract is 31 Mar 2009 with a 1 Nov 2009 completion date. The Davis-Bacon Act will apply. The Estimated Magnitude of Construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 237990, which has a size standard of $20 million in average annual receipts. Note: To be considered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon Congressional approval. Should Congress not authorize this project or appropriate the funds, the solicitation will be canceled. If the project is canceled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract.
