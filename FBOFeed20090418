<DESC>NECO SYNOPSIS
(FOR SOLE SOURCE)

The Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has a requirement to purchase one laboratory-grade amplifier/filter systems suitable for acoustic measurements in Navy small-scale model submarines.  This system will have remote control features suitable for model experiments, and a unique filter requirement that meets the very stringent noise floor characteristics required for the input of existing data acquisition systems. The existing system front end has proven to have electrical noise and this purchase will allow additional studies for the front end's redesign.
Precision Filters Inc., (PFI) is the only manufacturer of the laboratory-grade amplifier/filter system with a unique filter and remote control features suitable for model experiments.  In support of this effort NSWCCD intends to issue a Sole Source procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Precision Filters Inc., (PFI). 
The basis for a sole source is that PFI is the only source available to obtain this type of customized system installed to the Government's noise floor characteristics.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Information concerning this procurement may be made to Ancilla Garcia-Coolidge, the Government POC on or before 05/04/2009, referencing RFQ N00167-09-T-0110.-~

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  Disclaimer:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).   The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide a real time tracking mechanism for portable handheld radios on a nationwide scale in support of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) emergency response mission.   This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must mark their responses accordingly to ensure proper handling.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.BACKGROUND:  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) employs a wide variety of handheld radios that are used nationally on emergency response incidents. The unique nature of this work and the large area that incidents may encompass makes it difficult to locate assets that are lost or removed from the incident site. Currently the BLM and other agencies are relying on a paper check-out/check-in system for controlling the radio assets.  The BLM is looking at the possibility of using GPS or GPRS technology for a real time locating system by embedding a chip in each radio.  The radios are APCO P25 compliant and are expensive to purchase/replace.  The BLM is looking for a means to reduce the number of assets lost for various reasons each year.  There are nearly 11,000 radio asset in the national radio cache located at the National Interagency Fire Center.  These radio assets include following radio manufacturers and models:  Relm DPH5102, Thales PRC6894, Motorola XTS3000, Motorola XTS 2500, Datron G25RPV100, EF Johnson 5100, EF Johnson RS5300, and Relm EPH5102.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine what vendors are working with this type of technology and what different applications may exist to implement this type of tracking program. PROGRAM REQUIREMENT:  a)  The tracking mechanism should be in the form of a chip embedded with the internal components of the radio.  The operation of the mechanism cannot interfere with the operation of the radio.  The mechanism should be embedded in such a fashion that attempts by someone other than a trained technician to remove it from the radio will cause a failure in the ability of the radio to function without technical repair.    b)  The operation of the tracking mechanism must not interfere with any federally assigned radio frequencies causing interference with or loss of use of any frequency. c)  The tracking mechanism should function in a manner that will allow nationwide GPS coordinates of the radio to be determined to within a distance accuracy of 50 feet and operate from the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. d)  Means for accessing the tracking data should be by one of two options.1.  Web based.  The most preferred option would be for the operator to access a website that would allow the coordinate information to be obtained.  This should be a restrictive website requiring password access.  2.  Computer based.  The second option would be a software package that could be installed locally to allow access to the locating system and determine coordinate information.3.  Installation of the mechanism cannot void the manufacturer's warranty on the radios.
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:1.  Business Information:   Please provide the following business information for your company and for any teaming or joint venture partners:  Company Name; address; Point of Contact; Phone Number; E-mail Address; Web Page URL; whether your company is a small business based upon the SBA Size Standard of 750 employees for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 334220; whether your company is Woman Owned Business, a Small Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a HUBZone Certified Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, or a Small Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business; whether your company maintains a current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) registration.2.  Capabilities:   a)  Describe your cost-effective approach to deliver and install a GPS/GPRS mechanism in the radios described above.   b)  This would be a phased in approach over a two year period.  The installation would take place during the part of the year with the lowest potential usage (December to March).  C)  Describe your company's technical competencies and experience in developing and deploying GPS/GPRS tracking systems.  c)  Describe your experience and ability to support the deployment of the tracking package (mechanism/software).   D)  Describe your ability to work with the manufacturer on implementation of a program to insure warranty issues are not abrogated.Direct and succinct responses are preferred.  Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response.  Please limit responses to no more than 20 pages, and identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed.  Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.Interested parties should submit their information on or before May 5, 2009 prior to 4:30 pm  MDT.  Responses can be submitted referencing L09PS00358 via e-mail to kathy_colson@blm.gov or via mail to the Bureau of Land Management, National Interagency Fire Center, Attn:  Kathy Colson, 3833 South Development Avenue, Boise, ID  83705-5354.
