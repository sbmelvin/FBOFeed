<DESC>Industry Days Notice
<p>Support for the Combat and Mission Support Branch (AFLCMC/HBZC)</p>
<p><br />The Combat and Mission Support Branch, AFLCMC/HBZC, Hill AFB, Utah is holding Industry Days on 25-26 February 2013 for vendors interested in the design, development, and production of the Advanced Radar Threat System Variant 1(ARTS-V1), previously known as Joint Threat Emitter Increment 2 (JI2). The purpose of the Industry Days is to provide interested vendors performance data, specifications, and other related information pertaining to the ARTS-V1 and to obtain feedback from participating vendors in the form of a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).</p>
<p>ARTS-V1 is a Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) threat system simulator based on a foreign fielded, long range, "double digit", SAM threat system. The ARTS-V1 is designed to be used for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may be trained against the ARTS-V1, but the most stringent requirements placed on the ARTS-V1 system design come from fifth generation aircraft capabilities.</p>
<p>ARTS-V1 is a robust, ruggedized, mobile system. It will provide threat accurate radar tracking and reactivity, to include tracking and engaging multiple aircraft simultaneously with representative receiver/processor and electronic counter-counter-measure capabilities. The draft ARTS-V1 System Performance Specification (SPS) outlines the parameters and requirements the ARTS-V1 must meet. In addition, the system radar signature will meet threat representative parametric data of the actual threat as defined in the Integrated Technical Evaluation &amp; Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) reports associated with the threat and the Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) database. The system will provide threat representative full effective radiated power (ERP), replicate threat signals, antenna patterns, and threat tactics capabilities. ARTS-V1 will also connect to the range Integrated Air Defense System (IADS)-controlled threat environment and will communicate with range network systems. <br /><br />Vendors may request a copy of the draft ARTS-V1 SPS and/or the ITEAMS report number for the system of interest prior to the Industry Days by contacting the Buyer listed in the following paragraph.<br /><br />The Industry Days will be broken up into a general session with all vendors attending and break-out sessions with each vendor individually, as described in the attached Industry Days Schedule (Attachment 1). The general session will provide an overview of the program and allow vendors to ask questions. Break-out sessions will allow vendors a two-hour block to view classified requirements included in the appendix to the ARTS-V1 SPS, the ITEAMS reports associated with the threat, and identification of the actual threat system, and ask questions as needed. Vendors wishing to attend the Industry Days must RSVP via email NO LATER THAN 18 February 2013 to the Buyer, Michael Anderson, michael.anderson.3@hill.af.mil. Vendors will only be allowed a maximum of&nbsp;four attendees and must complete the registration form in Attachment 2 and submit it with their RSVP notice. All personnel planning to review the classified information must have a SECRET clearance and follow the instructions in Attachment 3 entitled "Access to Hill AFB."</p>
<p>The Government requests participating vendors submit feedback in the form of a ROM on or before 12 March 2013. The ROM should address development and testing, production, and a multi-threat emulator design option for the ARTS-V1. Specific instructions for preparing and submitting ROMs are attached to this notice (Attachment 4). <br /><br />This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. Participation is voluntary and participants will not be compensated. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor participation or submission of responses to this notice.</p>

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for repairing the Brock Inlet Canal Station 4 + 1.42 and proceeding in a westerly direction and ending at the reservoir inlet structure at the Brock Inlet Canal Station 354 + 75.51 located in Imperial County, CA roughly 1/2 mile West of Gordon's Well Interstate 8 (I-8) (Exit 151) interchange to just West of the Brock Research Center I-8 (Exit 146) interchange.
A Sources Sought was previously issued for this project referencing solicitation number R13PS34034, but due to conflicting solicitation number assignments in our internal contract database, the solicitation number has been changed to R13PS34065. 
Reclamation has completed a project that constructed an 8,000 acre-foot storage reservoir near Drop 2 on the All-American Canal in Imperial County in Southern California.
The recently completed reservoir will store Colorado River water that has been released from Parker Dam to meet downstream water orders but cannot be delivered for various reasons, such as changed weather conditions or other factors.  This water has typically not been put to beneficial use within the United States due to lack of sufficient storage capacity below Parker Dam.
During an inspection conducted on the above referenced facility, it was noted that there appeared to be thermal expansion in the inlet canal concrete lining due to due to the very large temperature variations that are typical for the southwest desert.  It was originally noted that the expansion joint sealant and in certain instances the sponge rubber joint sealant were being pushed out of the joints.
A second inspection of the inlet canal was conducted in conjunction with an outage in the system for maintenance work on the reservoir and associated structures.  During the second inspection, the engineers identified and inspected 76 existing expansion joints.  The existing expansion joints were spaced at varying intervals from 100 to 500 plus feet and contraction joints with water stop spaced at 14' between the individual expansion joints.  It was noted during the inspection that thermal movement to a varying degree has occurred in all of the existing expansion joints.  In some cases, the joints have completely closed up.  The original expansion joints were 1" wide filled with sponge rubber backer and non-sag joint sealant.  It has been conservatively estimated that the existing joints have moved anywhere from 5/8" to 1", in some cases totally closing the joints and extruding out the sealant and in some instances the sponge rubber expansion joint filler material.  In a number of locations, the existing concrete panel is actually riding up over the adjacent panel.
The principal components of work to be performed include the following:
1.  Install a temporary seepage control dike in the inlet channel to control water seepage through the gates.  Monitor and control nuisance water during construction.
2.  Saw cut 68 new, 1" wide expansion joints in the Brock Reservoir concrete lined inlet canal (canal is 16.5 feet deep, 18.5 feet bottom width and 2:1 side slopes).
3.  Re-establish 76 of the designated existing expansion joints back to being 1" wide by saw cutting. 
4.  Furnishing and installing 1" wide sponge rubber expansion joint material.
5.  Preparing the joint surface and furnishing and installing a non-sag elastomeric joint sealant. . 6.  Additional work may require the saw cutting and removal of designated portions of the lining to re-establish the existing expansion joint, the fine grading and compacting of earth materials, and the placing of concrete for patching the removed concrete.
This solicitation is 100% set aside for Small Business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M.  This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the method outlined in FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price construction type.

<DESC>The Department anticipates awarding a hybrid contract with a period of performance of 60 months (one 24-month base period and three one-year options) through a total small business set-aside with a qualified entity. The tasks described in the PWS shall be proposed via a partnership of contractors working together to submit a unified proposal that will be considered one submission. Large businesses are welcome to attend this presolicitation conference for the purposes of networking and partnering with a small business. The U.S. Department of Education (the Department), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is hosting a Pre-solicitation Conference that is open to responsible sources for the competition indicated below for work on the Education Resources Information Center. The purpose of this conference is to provide potential offerors with background information to better understand the Department&rsquo;s requirement. The attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided to interested parties for questions and comments. A description of the project for the competition is provided below. Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) The purpose of this requirement is contract with a vendor to operate and make continuous improvements to the usefulness and usability of the Electronic Resources Information Center (ERIC). ERIC is an online bibliographic and full-text digital library of education research, including journal articles and non-journal materials (e.g., technical report, conference paper). ERIC is the world&rsquo;s largest and most frequently used digital library of education resources. It is comprised of more than 1.4 million bibliographic records and more than 400,000 full-text materials indexed from 1966 to the present. Each of ERIC&rsquo;s 1.4 million bibliographic records contains an abstract of a journal article or non-journal document, along with indexed information such as the author, title, and publication date. The necessity and significance of ERIC to the field of education research is longstanding and widespread, as evidenced by over 250 million ERIC searches in 2012 and 6.5 million downloads of full-text documents in the same year. This requirement is comprised of three major activities: (1) maintaining the ERIC system, (2) re-organization and a redesign of the content of the IES (ies.ed.gov) website and the website for the National Center for Education Statistics or NCES (nces.ed.gov), and (3) the design and implementation of an education practitioners&rsquo; website on ERIC. The first major activity, maintaining the ERIC system, requires the contractor to index recently released documents, create abstracts, obtain agreements from journals to index their publications in ERIC, and to share ERIC data with vendors. The second major activity will involve redesigning the IES and NCES websites to streamline them with ERIC and the vocabulary of the ERIC. The third major activity or the design and implementation of the education practitioners&rsquo; website will introduce education practitioners who are unfamiliar with IES to IES and its mission. Expected Outcomes The priorities for the ERIC contract are intended to yield several important benefits for the program and the users. These include: &bull; Reorganizing and redesigning the IES and NCES websites; &bull; Developing a content specific, user-friendly practitioner&rsquo;s section of the website; &bull; Improving the current ERIC database to improve search functions; and &bull; Redefining the selection policy and cataloging relevant materials. The Pre-solicitation Conference will be held as follows: Date: Wednesday, February 20, 2013 Time: 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time Location: U.S. Department of Education 80 F Street NW IES Board Room 1st Floor Washington, DC 20001 **Registration is required for the event** Attendees must go through the AFGE entrance on F-street to access the boardroom. Questions and comments must be provided in writing in an email before the presolicitation conference. Please include the title of the procurement and the tracking number with your question or comment in the subject line of the email. Please submit a capability statement. All questions, comments, and capability statements should be sent by February 15, 2013 to Jennifer Arthur, Contracts Specialist, Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov no later than 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. There will be a time for questions and answers at the conference, for all questions submitted in writing by the aforementioned deadline. Questions asked in writing by February 15, 2013 will be answered at the conference; questions asked at the conference will be answered in an addendum to the applicable solicitation. Each contractor is required to email a list of attendees from their company by February 15, 2013 to Jennifer Arthur, Contracts Specialist, Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6070, Rockville, MD 20852, United States.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Nordion, Cobalt Operations; 447 March Rd; Ottawa, Ontario Canada K2K 1X8, to ship a government-owned GC-220 Cobalt-60 Irradiator back to the original supplier.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 the business size standard is $19.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Work shall be completed within ten (10) weeks from date of award at a time to be agreed upon by the NCI RBB and Best Theratronics.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract. <br />The Radiation Biology Branch is decommissioning a GammaCell (GC)-220 cobalt irradiator (s/n 169). The irradiator contains highly radioactive cobalt-60 and hence the shipment of the irradiator and its radioactive sources must be done by contractors who abide by strict radiation safety procedures and have been specifically trained for this procedure on these particular units. Further, the issue of security is of utmost importance given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has identified such radiation sources as potential targets for terrorists.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all essential means for packing and preparing the GC-220 for safe shipment from the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute to Nordion, 447 March Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, including labor, container rental, rigging, and all expenses for one factory trained service technician. The contractor shall have NRC-issued security clearance for unescorted access to the GC-220 irradiator by the period of performance start date. The contractor shall follow NRC guidelines for the shipping of the GC-220.<br /><br />The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), now named Nordion, manufactured the irradiator and still holds the original license for the cobalt-60 sources. Based on how the irradiator was manufactured, removal of the cobalt-60 sources on-site is not possible. The entire irradiator must be shipped to Nordion where they can be safely removed and disposed. Best Theratronics is the only sanctioned company by Nordion to service this irradiator, and as such it is the only source that has the required expertise to ship the cobalt-60 irradiator safely back to the original company that holds the license of the radioactive material. Further, in order for a contractor to package and remove a radioactive irradiator, the NRC must provide security clearance for unescorted access to the irradiators. Best Theratronics is the only source that meets these requirements for service on GC-220 irradiators. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 21, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Laura Glockner, Contract Specialist at laura.glockner@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through SAM.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130036-EB on all correspondence.</p>

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

The Government may (1) reject any or all applications if such action is in the public interest, (2) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br>  <br>   c.

The rentable square footage should yield 25,922 net usable square feet of space.  The lease term requirement is for two years firm with four six-month options.  The space must be available for occupancy by March 31, 2013.    All utilities and building equipment, maintenance and interior cleaning requirements shall be included in the rental rate.

1)	Building name, address and age 
2)	Total square footage available (ANSI/BOMA) office rentable and usable, and its location within the building

15)	Environmental issues known to exist on the site and any remediation efforts to taken or to-bhe-taken. 

Note: The VA will pay no more than the appraised fair market rental value for space. 
Usable square footage should be determined as follows:
If the space is on a single tenancy floor, compute the inside gross area by measuring between the inside finish of the permanent exterior building walls or from the face of the convectors (pipes or other wall-hung fixtures) if the convector occupies at lease 50-percent of the length of exterior walls.

If the space is on a multiple tenancy floor, measure from the inside finish of the permanent exterior building walls as above and to the room side finish of the fixed corridor and shaft walls and/or the center of tenant-separating partitions. 

In all measurements, make no deductions for columns and projections enclosing the structural elements of the building and deduct the following from the gross area including their enclosing walls:

1)	public toilets and lounges,
2)	stairwells,
3)	elevators and escalator shafts,
4)	building equipment and service areas,
5)	entrance and elevator lobbies, stacks and shafts, and
6)	corridors in place or required by local codes and ordinances; use 5.5% of inside gross area for corridors.

<DESC>Sources Sought: Analog Data Recorder Requirement  <br> Solicitation Number: W9124RRFIDATREC <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) is seeking to identify contractors that may be interested in and capable of providing an analog data recorder.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The information requested herein will be used by the Army to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  <br>  <br> YPG requires a low cost analog data recorder to support data collection on airdropped cargo and personnel.  The recorder is placed on an airdrop load and airdropped at altitudes up to 35,000 ft MSL.  The recorder is typically collecting accelerometer and stain gauge data to assess the acceleration and forces that an airdrop payload experiences during parachute deployment and ground impact.  The low cost requirement is due to the developmental nature of this testing, which occasionally results in total loss of airdrop payloads due to a malfunction.  The size limitation is due to limited space on paratroopers to collect data during personnel airdrops.  One challenging aspect of airdrop testing for data recorders is the Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) that occurs during parachute opening due to dry air passing across the fabric of the parachute.  YPG can accept spikes in the data due to ESD, but the recorder must be able to continue recording after an ESD event.   <br>  <br> Requirements: <br> -Record 8 (Threshold) to 16 (Objective) direct input analog channels <br> -Record 8 (Objective) direct input discrete channels <br> -Analog channel software programmable signal conditioned to ranges:  <br> a)0-10V <br> b) plus or minus 10mV <br> c) plus or minus 5V <br> d) 0-5V <br> -Each analog channel has bridge completion <br> -Record rate of 1000Hz (Threshold) to 5000Hz (Objective)    <br> -All data tagged with IRIG-B time stamp <br> -All channels provide 12V excitation voltage for sensors <br> -Integrated rechargeable battery with 5 hours of battery life <br> -Record 30 minutes (Threshold) 60 minutes (Objective) of data with 8 analog channels at 1000Hz (includes excitation voltage for analog channels) <br> -Two options for recording start:  <br> a) Programmable software trigger based on analog channel data <br> b) Input for external switch to start recording, switch does not need to be part of system.  <br> -Size: 50 in. cubed (Threshold) to 20 in. cubed(Objective) in a flat profile (including battery) <br> -Recorder must include a basic power on status indicator and a recording indicator.  <br> -Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection <br> -Weight: greater than 5lb (Threshold), greater than 2lb (Objective) <br> -Must meet MIL-STD-810G for the following environments <br> 	a) 500.5 - Low Pressure (altitude) up to 35,000ft <br> 	b) 501.5 - High Temperature, Climatic Design Type: Hot Dry (A1) <br> 	c) 502.5 - Low Temperature, Climatic Design Type: Cold (C2) <br> 	d) 511.5 - Explosive Atmosphere <br> 	e) 514.6 - Vibration: Aircraft C-17, C-130H, C-130J <br> 	f) 516.6 - Shock: Ground Impact (greater than 50G) <br> -EMI (C-130H, C-130J, C-17A) Must be able to pass government testing <br> -EMC (C-130H, C-130J, C-17A) Must be able to pass government testing <br> -Programming of the recorder must use a Graphical User Interface <br>  <br> Interested vendors shall provide a capabilities statement based on the above requirements. In addition, the capabilities statement shall address the following: <br>  <br> (1) Identify all socio-economic categories that apply to your company (i.e. small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) and women-owned small business). <br>  <br> (2) Does your company have a GSA schedule or any other Government contract vehicle? If so, is the proposed equipment offered on your GSA schedule or within the other contract vehicle? <br>  <br> (3) Is the equipment required for this solution commercially available or would it be developed exclusively for government purposes? <br>  <br> (4) Has your company provided this type of equipment in the past to any other Government agency? If so, please provide contract number, name of government agency, amount of award and date award was made. <br>  <br> (5) Has your company provided this type of equipment in the past to private industry? <br>  If so, please identify and provide details. <br>  <br> (6) What is the typical delivery schedule for this type of equipment? <br>  <br> (7) Identify if your company manufactures the equipment being supplied and the place that it is manufactured (i.e. manufactured in the United States or outside of the United States). <br>  <br> (8) What North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code would your company recommend for this equipment?  <br>  <br> (9)  What type(s) of warranties exist or may be offered for this type of system?   <br>  <br> The MICC-YPG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses, or pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the MICC-YPG's review of the information received.

Development of PVER will be undertaken by Reclamation as part of the LCR MSCP HCP and the California Parties' California Endangered Species Act (CESA) Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2005-008-06 (Permit) by converting agricultural crops to native riparian habitat. The overall goal for PVER is to develop and maintain as much riparian habitat as practical that will contribute to the habitat objectives for endangered and threatened species outlined in the LCR MSCP HCP and CESA Permit.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Getinge Signature Services for total care preventative maintenance for boiler and autoclave sterilizer maintenance for the National Marine Fisheries Service in Pascagoula, MS.

<DESC>Labor Market Survey: In addressing projects within the scope of Executive Order 13502, USACE districts will need to undertake a labor market survey as part of their PLA evaluation process. USACE district PDTs should consider the following:
<p>1. Issuing a Sources Sought Notice:<br />The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:</p>
<p>Flood Control &amp; Coastal Emergency Repair Delaware Coast from Cape Henlopen to Fenwick Island Bethany Beach, South Bethany, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Indian River Inlet North Shore, and Fenwick Island, DE</p>
<p>Project Description: The Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, is interested in awarding one (1) Firm Fixed Price Contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 14 for approximately 1,220,000 cubic yards of sand to be pumped from an offshore borrow area for replacement of the existing beaches and dune systems on to the Bethany and South Bethany Beaches, Rehoboth and Dewey Beaches, Indian River Inlet and Fenwick Island. Project Description is as follows: Bethany Beach/South Bethany - Approximately 310,000 CY of sand will be pumped from an offshore borrow area for replacement of the existing beach and dune system. The source of sand is the Fenwick Island Borrow Source located 3 miles off of Fenwick Island. There will be Options for additional sand. Fenwick Island - approximately 260,000 CY of sand will be pumped from an offshore borrow area for replacement of the existing beach and dune system. The source of sand is the Fenwick Island Borrow Source located 3 miles off of Fenwick Island. There will be options for additional sand. Delaware Coast Protection - approximately 380,000 CY of sand will be pumped from an offshore borrow area for replacement of the existing beach and dune system. The source of sand is the shoal within the Indian River Inlet. There will be Options for additional sand. Rehoboth/Dewey Beach - approximately 70,000 CY of sand will be pumped from an offshore borrow area for replacement of the existing beach and dune system.<br />The source of sand is the Fenwick Island Borrow Source located 3 miles off of Fenwick Island. There will be Options for additional sand.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Flood Control &amp; Coastal Emergency Repair Delaware Coast? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Flood Control &amp; Coastal Emergency Repair project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?</p>
<p>g. How will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email to Michelle Bertoline, Contract Specialist, at Michelle.J.Bertoline@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on 13 February 2013.</p>

Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  This does not include scheduled maintenance for PM purposes or when waiting for VA furnished tubes.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.

c)	If downtime exceeds sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the CO may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the CO.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with Default clause.

d)	Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the Contractor fails to meet the up-time requirements using the following formula:




MONTHLY DOWNTIME		% DECREASE

10 - 11 hours/month				0%

12 - 13 hours/month				20%

14 - 15 hours/month				40%

16 - 17 hours/month				60%

<SUBJECT>X--Request for Expression of Interest in DOE Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant
<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0005270
<CONTACT>Pamela S. Thompson
<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR DOE PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT FACILITIES AND DOE DEPLETED AND OFF-SPECIFICATION UF6 INVENTORIES The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is requesting expressions of interest (EOIs) from industry related to the following, either separately or in combination: ?	Lease or purchase of DOE Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) facilities or land near Paducah, Kentucky, either to continue the use of the facilities to enrich uranium, or separately for other nuclear fuel industry applications (e.g., analytical laboratory, uranium transfer and shipping facility) or to utilize individual facilities (e.g., buildings, warehouses, machine shops, utilities) for other commercial purposes. ?	Purchase, exchange, or transfer of various lots of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) inventories in standard and non-standard cylinders from the DOE PGDP and the DOE Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).  These inventories include large amounts of high-assay depleted UF6 (DUF6) and smaller amounts of slightly enriched and normal assay off-specification UF6.  All of these materials are free from any prior obligations.  In addition, DOE also has large amounts of low-assay DUF6 available.    This request for EOIs pertains only to the inventories of uranium identified in this EOI and no other DOE uranium inventories; for example, it does not pertain to DOE inventories of natural UF6 and is unrelated to the ongoing transfer of UF6 in exchange for cleanup work at PORTS. ?	Any combination of the above two bullets (e.g., use of a portion of the DUF6 in the enrichment operations at the PGDP). The intent of this request for EOIs is to identify opportunities to create value for the U.S. government while lowering overall program costs for surveillance and maintenance and/or disposal of uranium materials.  FOR FULL EXPRESSION OF INTEREST PACKAGE COMPLETE WITH ALL ATTACHMENTS GO TO http://www.pppo.energy.gov/Notices.html OVERVIEW OF PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT FACILITIES The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) currently leases the PGDP from DOE and operates the plant to enrich uranium.  It is expected that USEC will return essentially all of the PGDP facilities to DOE in the very near term.  When DOE accepts USEC?s return of the PGDP to DOE, the opportunity may exist for private industry to lease or purchase PDGP facilities or land, either to continue to enrich uranium and/or to utilize individual facilities (e.g., buildings, warehouses, machine shops, and utilities) for other commercial purposes.  The potential also exists for DOE to sell or transfer vacant land and/or personal property associated with PGDP facilities) for reuse/reindustrialization. The PGDP gaseous diffusion parallel cascade includes 1760 stages.  The parallel configuration allows the number of stages in series to shift as needed for production efficiency.  Through the use of different valve configurations, the plant is operated by USEC to enrich uranium up to assay s of about 5.5% 235U.  More detailed information about the PGDP is presented in Attachment 1. The PGDP is a large industrial site that may have radiological or chemical contamination within or around the perimeter of the facilities.  Facility contamination would need to be considered in planning for alternative uses at the site.  DOE is responsible for implementing the environmental cleanup program at PGDP under the Federal Facilities Agreement among DOE, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  DOE is interested in uses for PGDP assets that would benefit the local Paducah economy.  DOE will also consider the implications of any company that operates PGDP as an enrichment facility on the DOE mission to support national nuclear security and on any safeguards and security requirements.  Interested firms should provide information indicating whether they are a wholly-owned U.S. corporation or would otherwise be able to satisfy the legal requi rements in a manner that would allow any enriched uranium resulting from enrichment at the PGDP to be available for national security purposes.  Detailed information on conditions, considerations, and submittal requirements for EOIs for the lease or purchase of PGDP facilities is presented in Attachment 2.  DOE has broad authority, including section 161g. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to lease or sell real and personal property.  DOE looks to lease, sell or transfer the property in this EOI in a manner and at a value that is overall in the best interest of the government. OVERVIEW OF URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE (UF6) INVENTORIES DOE has large inventories of UF6 located at the DOE PGDP and at the DOE PORTS site near Piketon, Ohio.  DOE has DUF6 Conversion Plants at both of these locations.  DOE has identified the opportunity to offer for sale, exchange, or transfer (1) high-assay DUF6 (i.e., DUF6 with 0.341% to 0.7% 235U or more), as well as (2) certain off-specification, slightly enriched UF6 (i.e., UF6 with an average assay of 1% 235U) and normal-assay uranium (i.e., previously processed uranium with 0.711% 235U).  Large amounts of low-assay (i.e., 0.15% to 0.34%) DUF6 are also available.  DOE is seeking detailed EOIs from parties interested in receiving as UF6 the high-assay DUF6, the off-specification UF6, the low-assay DUF6, or a combination of the categories.  DOE would comply with all applicable laws in conducting any transfer or sale of uranium, including section 3112(d) of the USEC Privatization Act for transfers or sales of material covered by that section.   Attachment 3 presents a summary  of the high-assay DUF6 cylinders at PGDP and PORTS that shows assay ranges and total metric tons of uranium (MTU).  The DUF6 is primarily contained in thin-walled 14 ton metal (48G) cylinders.  The majority of this DUF6 meets the equivalent of the ASTM specification for commercial UF6 feed material, ASTM C787 11 Standard Specification for Uranium Hexafluoride for Enrichment.  (There is no ASTM specification for DUF6.)  However, some of the DUF6 is known to contain trace contaminants as a result of historical processing in the gaseous diffusion plant cascades.  Attachment 3 also presents a summary of information for the off-specification slightly enriched and normal UF6 material.  Additional information on all of these uranium materials is available on request. Responses to this request for EOIs should propose potential commercial use of the uranium materials in order to assist DOE in evaluating as necessary any potential adverse material impacts on the domestic uranium market.

<DESC>Title:  Fitch Solutions Subscription
Agency Contact Information: Acquisition Services Directorate National Business Center Department of the Interior 381 Elden Street, Suite 4000 Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Fitch Solutions. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporations export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Fitch Solutions Inc. as a source of current information about countries, banking systems and specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct their financial analysis of these countries and foreign banks.  Fitch has offices in these countries and spends significant time with each rated foreign bank in order to do an in-depth analysis.  Fitch also does an analysis of the sovereign government and the banking system in these countries and RAM relies on all of these reports to conduct its own analysis in order to establish country and bank credit limits.  This subscription allows RAM access to the ongoing reviews and reports for 100 foreign banks (the FAS current portfolio encompasses approximately 150 foreign banks), including the specific analyses of these banks and the countries in which they are located as well as their banking systems.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCCs export credit guarantee programs.  This is a proprietary, electronic analytical service available from one and only one source.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) , only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Fitch Solutions currently provides this type of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide this type of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.  The period of performance for this effort will be one year.  The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 12pm EST, Monday, February 18, 2013.  Please be advised that it is the offerors responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date.  Submissions shall be sent electronically to Michael McGuire, Contracting Officer at mike_mcguire@nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

<DESC>Title:  Bureau Van Dijks electronic Bankscope subscription
Agency Contact Information: Acquisition Services Directorate National Business Center Department of the Interior 381 Elden Street, Suite 4000 Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporations (CCC) export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Bureau Van Dijks Bankscope as a source of current information about specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct their financial analyses of these foreign banks.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCCs export credit guarantee programs.
Bureau Van Dijks Bankscope is the largest database provider of bank financial statements and the only reputable vendor of this product which RAM requires in order to complete its mission.  Bureau Van Dijk provides financial statements, financial ratios, ownership (parent and subsidiary) information as well as external rating agency country and bank-specific ratings which allows RAM to conduct its financial analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This subscription allows all RAM analysts to access and manipulate a comprehensive global database containing information on over 29,000 public and private banks throughout the world, including 16 years of detailed accounts, ratios, ratings and ownership information.  This database allows RAM to fill the analysis gap when we do not have access to a banks financial statements or its financial ratios.  It also permits RAM to produce a comparative analysis between a bank and its peer group within a country without the time and expense of visiting the banks.  This service is deemed available only from this source and is considered a proprietary electronic analytical service.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.

<SUBJECT>The Applied Research Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) to host Technical Exchange Day for the Remote Minehunting System (RMS) 
<SOLNBR>N0002413XXXXX
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Applied Research Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) will host Technical Exchange Day for the Remote Minehunting System (RMS) on 21 February 2013 from 1000 to 1400.  The event will take place at the Applied Science Building Auditorium on the campus of Penn State University, University Park, PA. 

RMS is a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water.  The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) carrying a towed variable depth sensor, the AN/AQS-20A.  The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated and maintained from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).
  The AN/AQS-20A incorporates five separate sonar/sensors (side-look sonar, forward-look sonar, volume search sonar, gap fill sonar, and electro-optical identification sensor) in a compact, lightweight, and hydro-dynamically stable towed body.  The AN/AQS-20A localizes mine-like objects and provides the operator with a visual image and a contact data list.  All mission data is recorded by the LCS for post-mission analysis.  Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Over-the-Horizon (OTH) communication provides vehicle Command and Control (C2) and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission.  The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield.  Current intentions call for the RMS to be deployed from the LCS as part of the ships Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Mission Package (MP).
The objective of the Technical Exchange Day is to provide a presentation to the industry engineering community to better understand RMS, challenges and future plans.
 

Briefings will be provided at the unclassified level (U.S. citizens only) but potential participants should be cleared to the Secret Level. The Point of Contact for participation at ARL/PSU for Technical Exchange Day is Laurie Richards at 814-863-4078 or lar38@arl.psu.edu. 

Visitors to ARL/PSU for Technical Exchange Day shall submit clearance information no later than COB 19 February 2013 as follows:

<DESC>Special Notice: Request for Information T2017<br />Agency/Office: TRICARE Management Activity<br />Location: Contract Operations Division - Aurora (Colorado)<br />Title: TRICARE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY - MANAGED CARE SUPPORT&nbsp;SERVICES
<p>DESCRIPTION:&nbsp; TRICARE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY (TMA) is contemplating the future generation of managed care contracts which includes cost reimbursable line items, fixed price line items, and requirements line items for the TRICARE Program of the Military Health System (MHS) in the United States to support active duty service members (ADSMs); active duty family members (ADFMs); retired service members and their eligible family members; survivors; Medal of Honor recipients; qualified former spouses; National Guard and Reserve members and their family members (including qualified non-active duty members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, Retired Reserve, and certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve). TRICARE supplements the care provided in Department of Defense (DoD) Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), as well as provides care to those eligible beneficiaries living in regions without access to MTFs. The period of performance is anticipated to be a transition-in phase of one year, plus five one-year options, and phase-out (if exercised).</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback on capabilities currently available to meet the later described MHS requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 524114.</p>
<p>The intent of this RFI is to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>To gather information from potential offerors to be utilized by the TMA TRICARE Program as support in our continuous market research for upcoming contract requirements. The information will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research in determining the proper acquisition strategy, type of contract, and to achieve its overall objectives under the TRICARE Program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: TRICARE is comprised of three health care options: Prime, Standard, and Extra. <br />TRICARE Prime is similar to a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) with a Point of Service Option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All ADSMs are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty health care, further explained in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 17. ADFMs may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee; other eligible beneficiaries pay an annual enrollment fee to enroll in TRICARE Prime. <br />TRICARE Extra, which requires no enrollment, is an option in which the beneficiary may choose to use a provider in a TRICARE contractor-developed network, at a reduced cost-share for a particular instance of care, but is not restricted to use of the provider network. <br />TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option, essentially the program formerly called the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The three options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 199.17 and 199.18. The MHS is organized into three TRICARE Regions within the United States and coverage extends overseas.</p>
<p>CONTRACT PURPOSE:&nbsp; TMA is contemplating the award of a contract utilizing a full and open competition acquisition approach to provide support to MTFs in providing health care services in the United States to ADSMs; ADFMs; retired service members and their eligible family members; survivors; Medal of Honor recipients; qualified former spouses; National Guard and Reserve members and their family members (including qualified non-active duty members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, Retired Reserve, and certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve). The Uniformed Services include the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS).</p>
<p>The anticipated future contract will supplement DoD MTFs by providing medical care provider networks and support services in required Prime Service Areas (PSAs) in the following location: United States.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:&nbsp; The following performance-based objectives are to be accomplished in an anticipated future contract:<br />&bull; Objective 1 - In partnership with the MHS, optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system (see the definition of Military Treatment Facility Optimization in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix B) for all MHS beneficiaries (active duty personnel, MTF enrollees, civilian network enrollees, and non-enrollees).<br />&bull; Objective 2 - Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer-friendly program services. Beneficiaries must be completely satisfied with each and every service provided by the Contractor during each and every contact.<br />&bull; Objective 3 - Attain "best value health care" (See TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix B) services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.<br />&bull; Objective 4 - Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery and minimal disruption to beneficiaries and MTFs.<br />&bull; Objective 5 - Full and real-time access to Contractor maintained data to support DoD financial planning, health system planning, medical resource management, clinical management, disease management, and contract administration activities.</p>
<p>MAJOR TASKS AND SERVICES:&nbsp; The following tasks and services are anticipated to be the major parts of the contract's scope:<br />&bull; General medical care provider networks in the location(s) stated above.<br />&bull; Claims processing and provider reimbursement (cashless/claimless for the ADSM and ADSM beneficiaries).<br />&bull; Customer service<br />&bull; Program enrollment and processing related fees/premiums<br />&bull; Beneficiary and provider education</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The following questions and request for information are provided for consideration during this "market research" phase of the acquisition. Please review and provide your responses to the Government for possible consideration/alternatives for satisfying mission needs of the TRICARE Program.</p>
<p>Question #1: What can industry recommend to lower costs of the TRICARE Program if there is:<br />&bull; No change in TRICARE's current policies (as documented in the TRICARE manuals at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil ), <br />&bull; No change in the Government's business systems (i.e., TMA, Defense Manpower Data System (DMDC), TRICARE Encounter Data System (TEDS), etc.), and <br />&bull; No change in the requirements for interfacing with the Government's business systems.<br />Within these stated constraints, present any minor or major operational TRICARE Program recommendations for process efficiencies, along with the associated potential cost savings. Applying known and innovative industry "best practices" and new technologies to your recommendations is welcomed and encouraged.</p>
<p>Question #2: Are there changes to TRICARE policies you would recommend to achieve improved operational efficiencies which have related cost savings for the Government?<br />Please limit your recommendations to those policies which could be changed within the TMA regulations and manuals, without the need for statutory CFR changes.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REQUIRED:&nbsp; Responses to this RFI should be no more than 15 pages total (including cover page). Responses should be submitted to Laura.Sells@tma.osd.mil no later than 8 March 2013. Please include reference data for a designated point of contact (name, title, address, phone/fax, email).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO IMMUNALYSIS CORPORATION TO ASSIST THE OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PERSONNEL AND READINESS WITH MISSION CRITICAL SUPPORT.
<p>WHS Acquisition Directorate intends to issue a contract to Immunalysis Corporation on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) was mandated in 1981 and given the mission to deter DoD personnel from using prohibited drugs. The DoD DDRP policy for military service members is promulgated in DoD Directive 1010.1, with detailed guidance concerning drug testing procedures contained in DoD Directive 1010.16. The DoD DDRP is aligned with DoD policies that pertain to health and readiness within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.</p>
<p>DDRP's mission involves compulsory random drug testing with punitive consequences, anti-drug education, and treatment. The effectiveness of this program is measured by monitoring the prevalence of drug use from drug testing statistics published annually. <br />DDRP conducts testing at six DoD Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratories (FTDTLs), as well as the Forensic Toxicology Laboratory of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (FORTOX-AFMES). Each location currently uses the Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s) to perform mission critical testing. There are approximately 24 D-Modular systems spread throughout DDRP's testing environment. The Government has invested approximatly $4.32M in its existing instrumentation which enables DDRP to meet mission goals.</p>
<p>The DDRP has a mission critical requirement to test the use of synthetic cannabinoids by members of the Military Services. As such, this effort is to procure immunoassay reagents to be used on the Government's existing Hitachi / Roche instrumentation to meet the Government's need. (Note: There is currently not a requirement to replace the existing analyzer systems.)</p>
<p>Since the introduction and widespread use of synthetic cannabinoids into the drug culture, the DDRP has conducted a joint effort with the National Institute of Drug Abuse and AFMES to identify a strategy to deter and detect the use of synthetic cannabinoids by military personnel. In the course of this effort, Immunalysis Corporation was identified as the only manufacturer of an immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent <br />and/or metabolites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse on the existing analyzer systems currently in use at the FTDTLs and FORTOX-AFMES. <br />Therefore, the initial contract action will be established with Immunalysis Corporation as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of 12 months, from approximately 04 MAR 2013 through 28 FEB 2014, and will include four (4) 12 month option periods. WHS Acquisition Directorate anticipates issuing firm fixed price delivery orders under this contract to meet the mission critical needs of DDRP. The estimated minimum base order amount is $47,000.00 and the not-to-exceed maximum total is $1.6M including all options.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that another manufactured immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent and or metablites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse is compatible with the existing Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s). If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice. Interested parties may identify their capabilities with respect to this requirement by 26 February 2013, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. All information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 424210 (Diagnostic reagents merchant wholesalers).</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The 380th Expeditionary Contracting Squadron intends to award competitively a contract for commercial travel office services at Al Dhafra Air Base, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The contractor shall provide all services required to operate the commercial travel office in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Service shall begin and be carried out as stated in this solicitation and must meet the requirements specified in the PWS and herein.</p>
<p>From this solicitation a single award, non-personal service contract is expected to be awarded on a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) with Acceptable Past Performance basis. The contract is expected to commence on 1 May 2013 and will include a base year, four (4) option years, and an option to extend services period of up to six (6) months. The Government has no obligation to exercise options, even though the options will be included in the overall price evaluation.</p>
<p>Offerors must comply with FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation Criteria - Commercial Items as stated in solicitation FA5706-136-R-0012 when submitting a proposal. The offeror is responsible for complying with ALL criteria specified in the solicitation. The following four paragraphs represent excerpts from the solicitation.</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability. The evaluation team will assess the technical proposal on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Each proposal will be given either an acceptable or unacceptable rating. If all documentation requested in FAR 52.212-1 is submitted correctly and the technical proposal meets the PWS requirements the offeror shall be rated as acceptable. This includes a completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3. A proposed Quality Control Plan (QCP) that demonstrates how the offeror tends to manage the contract to ensure all requirements are met in accordance with the PWS must be included in the technical proposal. Failure to submit any requirement or the proper documentation may result in the offeror being eliminated prior to evaluation of past performance.</p>
<p>2. Evaluating Past Performance. Offerors must send the Past Performance Questionnaire to at least two (2) clients who have received the same or similar service. Similar service is defined as work involving the management and running of a CTO that is capable of being open for services 365 days per year and supporting at least 300 travelers per month. Only services that have been performed within the past five (5) years from issuance of this solicitation will be valid. The evaluation team will assess past performance, specifically the quality and satisfaction rating of relevant and recent contracts obtained from the results of past performance questionnaires. Past performance references who have returned questionnaires determined to be recent and relevant will be used in the past performance assessment. Past performance will either be assessed on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. A minimum of two questionnaires must be submitted in order to receive an acceptable rating. Past performance will be deemed acceptable if the offeror's performance record gives the Government a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the requirement.</p>
<p>3. Evaluating Price. The total service fee prices are inclusive of all contract line items. The basic year, and all option years will be evaluated. Award shall be made to the lowest priced offeror that is determined to be most advantageous to the Government. The proposal shall include pricing for all CLINs in United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED).</p>
<p>4.

The offeror must submit a proposal that is valid for a minimum of 30 days from the end of the solicitation period. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>A complete proposal, including past performance questionnaires, MUST be received no later than March 8, 2013 at 1700 hours local time, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>Descriptive Literature:<br />a. "Descriptive Literature" means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings, brochures) that is submitted as a part of a proposal. Descriptive Literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that are specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design; (2) materials; (3) components; (4) performance characteristics; and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.

<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. The System for Award Management (SAM) replaces CCR. Registration may be done on line at: www.acquisition.gov or www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (d) products samples, (e) multiple offers, and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-5. Facsimile Proposals</p>
<p>FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract. The Government contemplates award of one firm-fixed price contract.</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS. Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the Government Accountability Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR).<br />(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up to date information about this acquisition. No partial quotes will be considered. No partial awards will be made.
<p><br />The Request for Quote number is RFQ0739132091 and is being conducted as a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 423490 - Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers; the size standard is 750 employees.

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation requires the following items, Brand Name Only, to the following:</p>
<p>Line 001, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK5x4, 3, CS;<br />Line 002, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK3x6, 3, CS;<br />Line 003, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK4x7, 3, CS;<br />Line 004, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK9x6, 3, CS;<br />Line 005, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK12x12, 3, CS;<br />Line 006, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK13x11, 4, CS;<br />Line 007, Aloksak Bags, B-aLOK8x11, 3, CS;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Technical Specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; Liquid tight and airtight bags - Certified liquid tight to depths of 200M;<br />&bull; 6-mil film thickness;<br />&bull; Low temperature crack resistant to minus 40 degrees F;<br />&bull; Zip closure type bag closure;</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification:</p>
<p>The FBI is responsible for providing field and forensic investigative work in environments potentially contaminated by hazardous materials including chemical or biological agents, nuclear materials and toxic industrial chemicals.</p>
<p>The FBI has a requirement for Aloksak liquid/air tight storage bags to be utilized for the collection, over packing and transportation of biological, chemical or radiological evidence as required at various investigation sites throughout the country.</p>
<p>The work of the FBI is highly technical and requires the staff to be equipped with state of the art safety and evidence collection equipment. The Aloksak bags are needed in order to ensure the health and safety of all FBI personnel during collection and transportation.</p>
<p>The Aloksak bags have been tested to be waterproof to 200 meters, and are comprised of a thicker plastic material than other "Ziploc" type bags. This thicker nature of the bags and proof to be waterproof is needed in an environment where containment of the material is necessary. Potentially hazardous, if not deadly, material will be placed in these bags; the Aloksak bags have been proven to be reliable.</p>
<p>FOB Destination: FBI Operational Response Center, 1000 Falls Run Drive, Fredericksburg, VA 22406. The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage under a normal commercial warranty.

Registration shall be done at www.SAM.gov</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The following FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by full text:<br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010) <br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (FEB 2012) -<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Marshall Bioresources, located in North Rose, NY for 56 Gottingen Mini pigs which will be used for medical research.<br /><br />These animals will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services. As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts. <br /><br />For the past 4 years we have used the Gottingen mini pig to study acute radiation injury. The Gottingen Mini pigs at 4-5 month old weigh about 22 pounds with a width of about 5.5 inches. The Gottingen Mini pig is the smallest mini pig available with limited breeding, high quality microbiological genetic background. For consistency of results, good quality science and to avoid unnecessary experimental repetition, it is imperative that for our studies we continue to use the same strain of mini pigs that we have studies so far. Other strains have different hematological properties and radio-sensitivities. The animals are barrier bred and raised in a special state-of the-art barrier production facilities, and therefore free from any porcine infectious bacterial, viral, or parasitic diseases. In addition, mini pigs other than the Gottingen Mini pigs weigh well above 100 pounds and we do not have the space to house larger animals. <br /><br />Marshall Bioresources is the only know source that can provided the requested animals.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be received via email (alphonso.simmons@usuhs.edu) by 10:00 p.m. EST on February 17, 2013. <br />

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> Quotes are being requested via this synopsis and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF30080708 is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition.  The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65.  This requirement is a 100% set-aside for small business under NAICS Code 334413 (SIC 3674 ) with a size standard of 500 Employees. All cost associated with delivery to Vicksburg, MS shall be included in the quote.   <br>  <br> The use of dense wavelength division multiplexers, in conjunction with fiber optic sensors, will be a key component of research and field support.  The objective is to incorporate these devices in a modular experimental setup to perform the multiple roles of supporting in-theatre sensor deployment, field testing, and in-house research and development.  Much of the work involves researching new applications using fiber optic cables as acoustic and seismic sensors, as well as supporting field deployment of fiber optic cables.   <br>  <br>  <br> The requirements for the dense wavelength multiplexers are as follows:   <br>  <br> SPECIFICATIONS FOR DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXERS (DWDMs)  <br>  <br> A set of optical Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexers (DWDMs) with 50GHz ITU Channel Spacing, and three ports, covering five channels over the following telecom wavelengths, in what is known as the C-band for fiber optics (  = 1530 nm to 1562 nm): <br>  <br> *ITU Channel #	Wavelength,   [nm]	Frequency [GHz]	Quantity <br> C33	         1550.92	               193,300	    4 <br> C34	         1550.12	               193,400	    4 <br> C35	         1549.32	               193,500	    4 <br> C36	         1548.52	               193,600	    4 <br> C37	         1547.72	               193,700	    4 <br>  <br> (*note:  ITU stands for  quote mark International Telecommunication Union, quote mark  and is used as a standard in the telecommunications industry).   <br>  <br> DWDM's are used to multiplex light signals for fiber optic applications.  This particular DWDM design is often referred to in the literature as an 'Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer [1x2]'.   Wavelength division multiplexing is a technique whereby optical signals, of different wavelengths, may be combined, transmitted together, and separated again.  The technique is used in optical fiber telecommunications to transmit several signals simultaneous at different wavelengths along a single fiber.  In this way, the transmission capacities are increased.   <br>  <br> DMDM's must be provided with standard FC/APC connectors. <br>  <br> Parameter	 <br> Channel Wavelength [nm]	ITU Grid.  Specific channels: <br> 1550.92, 1550.12, 1549.32, 1548.52, 1547.72 (Channels 33 through 37 inclusive) <br> Center Wavelength Accuracy [nm]	  0.02 <br> Connector Type	FC/APC <br> Minimum Channel Spacing [GHz]	50 <br> Channel Pass band (@ -0.5 dB bandwidth) [nm]	  0.07 <br> 	 <br> Add/Drop Channel Ripple [dB]	  0.5 <br> 	 <br> Express Channel Isolation [dB]	  10 <br> Insertion Loss Temperature Sensitivity [dB/oC]	  0.004 <br> Wavelength Temperature Shifting [nm/oC]	  0.002 <br> PDL [dB]	  0.10 <br> Polarization Mode Dispersion [ps]	  0.1 <br> Directivity [dB]	  45 <br> Return Loss [dB]	  45 <br> Power Handling Capability [mW]	300 <br> Operating Temperature [oC]	0 to +70 <br> Storage Temperature [oC]	-40 to +85 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Line Item 0001: DWDM ITU Channel Number C33, Frequency 193,300 (GHz), Wavelength 1550.92 (nm) Quantity 4, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Line Item 0002: DWDM ITU Channel Number C34, Frequency 193,400 (Ghz), Wavelength 1550.12 (nm) Quantity 4, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Line Item 0003: DWDM ITU Channel Number C35, Frequency 193,500 (Ghz), Wavelength 1550.32 (nm) Quantity 4, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Line Item 0004: DWDM ITU Channel Number C36, Frequency 193,600 (Ghz), Wavelength 1548.52 (nm) Quantity 4, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Line Item 0005: DWDM ITU Channel Number C37, Frequency 193,700 (Ghz), Wavelength 1547.72 (nm), Quantity 4, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Line Item 0006: Shipping Quantity 1, Unit: Each, Unit Price: _______,  <br> Total Amount_______ <br>  <br> Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose quote is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.

<p>(xx) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>HSAR 3052.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting, if applicable, will be specified on each task order.<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down.

The Contracting Officer will provide a written notice of such designation to the Contractor within five working days after contract award or for construction, not less than five working days prior to giving the contractor the notice to proceed. The designation letter will set forth the authorities and limitations of the COTR under the contract.<br />(b) The Contracting Officer cannot authorize the COTR or any other representative to sign documents, such as contracts, contract modifications, etc., that require the signature of the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>1.2 BACKGROUND<br />MSRT is the Coast Guard's only counter-terrorism force with advanced interdiction capabilities and boarding skills. MSRT provides rapid response to Maritime Homeland Security/Maritime Homeland Defense operations. MSRT provides a highly specialized resource with advanced skills and tactics for non-compliant and high threat terrorist events in a counter-terrorism role. MSRT is trained to be a first responder to potential terrorist situations, deny terrorist acts, perform non-compliant security actions, perform tactical facility entry and enforcement, participate in port level counter-terrorism exercises, and educate other forces on USCG counter-terrorism procedures. These advanced skills and tactics require specific and frequent training to maintain a requisite high level of proficiency. MSRT units have a four-hour operational response deployment time as part of their important mission. Therefore, the USCG is seeking a facility to conduct MSRT internal skill-sustainment training for operational personnel to keep their tactical skills current and precise.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(3) FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) but no more than three (3) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>(a) Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact with telephone numbers)<br />(b) Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />(c) Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />(d) Required completion date for the contract<br />(e) Date the services were actually completed<br />(f) Ship Name, Hull Number <br />(g) Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />(h) Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br /><br />Quality of Product or Service <br />Did the customer get what was specified? <br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality? <br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected? <br />Schedule <br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?) <br />Business Relations <br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction? <br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)? <br />Management of Key Personnel <br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>A quote without a record of relevant, past performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.<br /><br />****Past Performance is more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers.</p>
<p>(End of FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(4) FAR 52.215-20 REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010) ALT IV</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required <br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination.</p>
<p>The information may be as follows:</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below: <br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.) <br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category <br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade <br />Cost/hour/trade <br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each) <br />Sub-total <br />Pension Plans <br />Overhead at a rate of ______% <br />Profit at a rate of ________% <br />Total for item _____________</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract.

<p>(1) (_) Are, (_) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) (_) Have, (_) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) (_) Are, (_) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) (_) Have, (_) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

<DESC><p>REPAIR OF THE CRYOENGINE FOR THE AGM-65 INFRARED IR GUIDANCE AND CONTROL SECTION</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the repair of AGM-65 Maverick Missile Cryoengine.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The USAF is seeking potential contractors to support an AGM-65 Cryoengine repair (NSN: 1420-01-142-4363JB &amp; 1420-01-370-2130JB). AGM-65 Maverick Missile is a unique and aging weapon system requiring periodic testing to preclude catastrophic failure. <br />The AGM-65 IR Cryoengine Assembly is a critical component of the AGM-65 IR Missile Guidance and Control Section (GCS). The AGM-65 Cryoengine cools the IR detectors to approximately -200 &deg;C. This subzero temperature is necessary to properly detect all possible ranges of IR energy that are emitted and encountered during operation. The IR detectors receive and translate IR energy into a video scene displaying variations in temperature as variations in contrast, and allowing a target to be identified by the aircrew and subsequently tracked by the missile. AGM-65 IR missiles with malfunctioning Cryoengines produce a washed out video scene that makes identifying targets difficult and/or impossible. The AGM-65 Cryoengine Assembly is a Sterling closed-loop refrigeration unit that consists of a pump, capillary tube, expander, cold finger, and helium refrigerant. Cooling can take up to 3 minutes once the missile is activated.</p>
<p>This is a Cost Plus Fixed Price (CPFF) contract. For Infrared Cryoengine Repair</p>
<p>Interested offerors should respond to this synopsis within 15 days following the publication of this notice. Responses must clearly demonstrate the qualifications, capability and expertise of the vendor. Responses to this notice will be used as part of the market research that will be used to develop the acquisition strategy to satisfy this potential requirement. Written responses may be sent to the Contracting Officer at OO-ALC/GHGKA, 6033 Elm Lane, Bldg 1247, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825, ______________________________________________________ Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this sources sought. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow-up information requested. This sources sought is directed only to those vendors who believe that they would be capable of supporting this potential requirement. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. Also, in order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Program Manager - Guardian Product Manager - Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a need for Increment 3 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System.   The objective of this acquisition is to provide Automated Installation Entry (AIE) hardware and software for up to 35 new installations.  AIE provides timely, effective and efficient threat detection necessary for Installation Commanders to assess and react in all threat environments.  AIE automates access control processes for authorized and registered personnel entering an installation.  AIE improves accuracy of access/denial and enables near real-time changes of authentication requirements in response to changes in force protection conditions.  The AIE acquisition will enhance installation security and improve both pedestrian and vehicle throughput at Access Control Points (ACP).  The third generation AIE System (AIE-3) will build on AIE-2 capabilities while meeting U.S. Army AIE Standards and Specifications dated 19 November 2007.  Additional capabilities will include biometric integration, extended sensor suites, enhanced automated processes and integration with the Joint Service architecture.  AIE-3 will be DIACAP accredited, net-ready and interoperable with legacy AIE systems and related base defense, force protection and physical security systems.  AIE-1 and AIE-2 installations may be retrofitted within the scope of this contract. <br>  <br> A Product Demonstration will be required for interested vendors. Information regarding Product Demonstration Procedures and Product Demonstration Evaluation Criteria will be released in the RFP. Vendors will be required to self nominate for participation in the Product Demonstration within two weeks of solicitation release in accordance with the RFP. The AIE-3 contract will be awarded using full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.  The Government will award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $99M.  The POP will be four years (a two-year base and two one-year options). <br>  <br> A single Delivery Order (DO) will be awarded for each installation that includes site survey, site design, hardware and software acquisition and integration, fielding and CLS.  The DO will ensure the AIE-3 systems fielded across all installations are based on one integrated, Government-approved system configuration.   <br>

<DESC> <br> The US Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) announces the ARI FY13-18 Broad Agency Announcement for Basic, Applied, and Advanced Scientific Research.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 (The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984) and subsequent amendments. <br>  <br> The US Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues.  Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness.  The funding opportunity is divided into two sections- (1) Basic Research and (2) Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development.  The four major topic areas of research interest include the following:  (1) Training; (2) Leader Development; (3) Team and Inter-Organizational Performance in Complex Environments; and (4) Solider/Personnel Issues.   <br>  <br> Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle.  Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Part II Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the R&D warrants further inquiry.  If the R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a proposal will be entertained.  The recommended three-step sequence is (1) telephone call to the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) full proposal submission.   <br>  <br> Awards may be made in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.   <br>  <br> Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&D) in those areas specified in Part II Section A of this BAA.  The US Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences encourages Historically Black Colleges and Universities/ Other Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) (FAR Part 26.3) small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses (FAR Part 19) to submit proposals for consideration.  Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.  Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and US Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients.  However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).   <br>  <br>  <br> This BAA may be accessed from the following websites:  <br>  <br> https://www.fbo.gov   <br>  <br> http://www.grants.gov <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>

Overhaul of the Power Supply shall be overhauled to the OEM blueprints, drawings, and specifications.  Product Verification Audit (PVA) is not required, because this item is sole sourced back to the OEM.

Any competing contractor could not be familiar with the total design parameters, specific repair requirements, test processes, etc. for the Power Supply, and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to require a considerable length of time to commence or complete a overhaul program, with no guarantee of success due to factors identified herein.  No telephone requests for solicitation will be accepted.  Request for solicitation will be by fax (256) 313-8194 or mailed.

<DESC>EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel). These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support. The complete scopes of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed herein. The EXPRESS program consists of four (4) domains in which services may be ordered: Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical (B&A). Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the domains as follows: Business & Analytical - 4 each, Logistics - 6 each, Programmatic - 6 each, and Technical - 11 each. The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the Government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams. The purpose of the current open season is to add additional BPA teams.   <br>    <br>  The Government intends to award additional BPAs in the following domains as noted: B&A - two small business (SB); Logistics - one full and open (F&O) and two SB; Programmatic - one F&O, 2 SB and one 8A; and Technical - one F&O, one SB and one 8A. These are estimated numbers only. The Government reserves the right to vary the number of awards depending on the number of responsive quotations submitted. The F&O awards will be determined first, followed by the SB awards, and finally the 8(a) awards. Eligibility to compete for the anticipated BPA awards is limited to those businesses which hold one of the required GSA schedules and, for the SB/8A awards, which meet the size standards for the NAICS Code applicable to that schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program. Respondents may seek consideration as a prime/team leader in more than one domain.   <br>    <br>  Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules at the time it responds to the Request for Quotation (RFQ): 871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Information Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers. Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to the RFQ. However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the majority of the domain requirements must be identified. Companies interested in obtaining a GSA schedule, or expediting a schedule application that has been submitted may contact the local representative, Eddie Mills via email at eddie.mills@gsa.gov.   <br>    <br>  If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents' schedule by GSA will apply. If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541330 and a size standard of $35.5M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS Code 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain. If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $25.5M will apply to all domains. If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified. The NAICS Code and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply. The applicable NAICS Code must be available on the schedule identified as primary. The small business certification which was made at the primary schedule contract level, for that applicable NAICS Code, will be utilized to determine business size for EXPRESS.   <br>    <br>  The Open Season Requests for Quotation (RFQs) are anticipated to be posted to the EXPRESS Public Website on Monday, 4 February, 2013, at the following link:  <br>    <br>  http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa/Express.asp  <br>    <br>  Responses to the RFQs will be due approximately 30 days after the RFQ issue date.  All documentation required for response to the RFQs will be available on the website above. The RFQs will contain specific instructions for submittal of quotations.   <br>    <br>  RFQ Numbers are as follows: W31P4Q-13-T-0048 (B&A), W31P4Q-13-T-0049 (LOG), W31P4Q-13-T-0050 (PROG), and W31P4Q-13-T-0051 (TECH).  <br>    <br>  Respondents are cautioned that failure to comply with the following criteria will result in the rejection of their submission, and they will not be considered for award: (1) Must hold one of the required GSA schedules, as of the date of submission of quote, and (2) Submission of all required documentation as stated in the RFQ.   <br>    <br>  Responses to the RFQs shall be enclosed in a sealed package and delivered to the following location no later than the date specified in Block 8 of the RFQ SF 1449.  In addition those Offerors who choose to deliver RFQ packages in person and who do not have current post access privileges, should contact the below POC not later than 10 business days before the due date of the RFQ for post access information.   <br>    <br>     Army Contracting Command - Redstone (ACC-RSA)  <br>     Attn: CCAM-EX-P / Mr. Elbert Clarke  <br>     Sparkman Center, Building 5303  <br>     Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898  <br>     (256) 876-2649 / elbert.clarke@us.army.mil  <br>    <br>  Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address.

<DESC><p>The Department anticipates awarding a hybrid contract with a period of performance of 60 months (one 24-month base period and three one-year options) through a total small business set-aside with a qualified entity. The tasks described in the PWS shall be proposed via a partnership of contractors working together to submit a unified proposal that will be considered one submission. Large businesses are welcome to attend this presolicitation conference for the purposes of networking and partnering with a small business.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is hosting a Pre-solicitation Conference that is open to responsible sources for the competition indicated below for work on the Education Resources Information Center. The purpose of this conference is to provide potential offerors with background information to better understand the Department's requirement. The attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided to interested parties for questions and comments. A description of the project for the competition is provided below.</p>
<p>Education Resources Information Center (ERIC)</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is contract with a vendor to operate and make continuous improvements to the usefulness and usability of the Electronic Resources Information Center (ERIC). ERIC is an online bibliographic and full-text digital library of education research, including journal articles and non-journal materials (e.g., technical report, conference paper). ERIC is the world's largest and most frequently used digital library of education resources. It is comprised of more than 1.4 million bibliographic records and more than 400,000 full-text materials indexed from 1966 to the present. Each of ERIC's 1.4 million bibliographic records contains an abstract of a journal article or non-journal document, along with indexed information such as the author, title, and publication date. The necessity and significance of ERIC to the field of education research is longstanding and widespread, as evidenced by over 250 million ERIC searches in 2012 and 6.5 million downloads of full-text documents in the same year. <br />This requirement is comprised of three major activities: (1) maintaining the ERIC system, (2) re-organization and a redesign of the content of the IES (ies.ed.gov) website and the website for the National Center for Education Statistics or NCES (nces.ed.gov), and (3) the design and implementation of an education practitioners' website on ERIC. The first major activity, maintaining the ERIC system, requires the contractor to index recently released documents, create abstracts, obtain agreements from journals to index their publications in ERIC, and to share ERIC data with vendors. The second major activity will involve redesigning the IES and NCES websites to streamline them with ERIC and the vocabulary of the ERIC. The third major activity or the design and implementation of the education practitioners' website will introduce education practitioners who are unfamiliar with IES to IES and its mission.</p>
<p>Expected Outcomes</p>
<p>The priorities for the ERIC contract are intended to yield several important benefits for the program and the users. These include:</p>
<p>&bull; Reorganizing and redesigning the IES and NCES websites;<br />&bull; Developing a content specific, user-friendly practitioner's section of the website;<br />&bull; Improving the current ERIC database to improve search functions; and<br />&bull; Redefining the selection policy and cataloging relevant materials.</p>
<p>The Pre-solicitation Conference will be held as follows:<br />Date: Wednesday, February 20, 2013 <br />Time: 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time<br />Location: U.S. Department of Education<br />80 F Street NW<br />IES Board Room 1st Floor <br />Washington, DC 20001</p>
<p>**Registration is required for the event**</p>

<DESC><strong>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:<br /><br /></strong><strong><em>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:</em></strong>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) requires a large, complex data collection as part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) program at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a part of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES).</p>
<p>IPEDS is the Department's core postsecondary education data collection program. It is comprised of institutional-level data used to describe trends in postsecondary education at the institutional, state, and national levels, as well as to provide students and families with consumer information about colleges and universities. This data collection is designed to continue a series of cross-sectional data collections mandated by the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended). The method for the data collection shall be a web-based survey. Each collection shall culminate in a tabular report, documented data files, and release of data through online dissemination and analysis tools.</p>
<p>The Department intends to award a 24-month base contract with three 24-month option periods. The total period of performance of the contract and option period is 60 months. Each option period corresponds with a complete survey cycle for a period of about 24 months, from initial preparation of survey screens and edits through adjudication of the final report and documentation. Each subsequent option period will overlap for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.</p>
<p>The contract type is anticipated to include both Firm-Fixed-Price and Cost Reimbursement Tasks.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) in February 2013.</p>

<DESC>1.	Statement of Purpose:
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is a diverse and distributed organization with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, VA.  It also has 8 Regional Offices and the National Conservation Training Center separated across the United States.   Additionally, the Service has 700+ geographically separated field offices with a large variety network connections from commercial satellite in our more remote locations to a full DS-3 connective in the Washington, D. C. headquarters. The Service has a requirement for an integrated, multi-layered video capability that would support: 	Video broadcasting from the below locations to a static and mobile user base of 9000+ employees -	Washington, D.C.

Multicast of streaming video is preferred. 	The capability to record video broadcasting, video conferencing and web conferencing events for later rebroadcasting or video library.  Broadcasting, rebroadcasting and video library (video products) must meet all federal mandated regulatory requirements to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The Service would need the capability to effectively store, edit and manage the content for video products.  The video products should be available on demand through variety equipment to include computers, smart phones and other mobile devices 	The Service will be required to store all recorded events with the ability to share the files with government and non-government agencies This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The purpose of this RFI is to identify current and emerging technologies capable of meeting the requirements listed above  Additionally, the Service desires a recommendation on what would be needed to integrate this equipment within the existing Department of the Interiors and the Services Information Technology infrastructure.  Any recommendations must be designed and implemented with an enterprise approach and flexible to enough to allow a multi-phased, multi-year implementation.
2. Project Description: 	 This project, when fully implemented will permit Service leadership to address all Service employees from anywhere, anytime using a variety IT devices.  Communications can be one-to-one, conferencing or broadcasting.  The successful solution should be designed to enable minimal set up time with minimal notification.
The USFWS currently owns a Cisco Codian 40 port video bridge and approximately 100 video teleconferencing systems spread out across the Service.  These systems are typically manufactured by Tandberg, Cisco or Polycom.   The Services video teleconferencing infrastructure is primarily internet protocol based with limited dial in ISDN capable.  These systems operate in standard definition limited to 384KB duplex video stream.
The Service vision for the Unified Video Communications project is to continue to use our existing video systems and to leverage the latest technologies in video conferencing and broadcasting to a variety of computers and mobile and smart devices.  The current capability requires scheduling time for systems and facilities.  The desired design still includes these systems and facilities, but will also be able to establish video communications ad hoc or on-the-fly with one or multiple parties.

3. Request for Information:
This Request for Information must include:
	The capabilities of existing and emerging technologies that meet the project description above.  	At least three case studies on how this technology is being used today by organizations with similar diverse and distributive architectures like the Service 	A recommended architecture that could be integrated with the Services existing IT architecture 	Capabilities of extending 2-8 cable TV channels (national news, CSpan, etc.) to the desktop 	An overview of the financial investment needed to implement, operate and maintain the recommended architecture.  This overview should anticipate an initial investment the first year with further expansion in the next 5-years.

<DESC>Responses to this Survey are requested no later than 7 February 2013.&nbsp; Responses can be sent via email or by USPS to Kevin Henricks.&nbsp; There are no requirements to complete the survey form itself.&nbsp; The request is to submit answers to the survey questions in a format of the respondents choosing such as the&nbsp;form, in an email, or on company letterhead.&nbsp;<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, will be issuing a solicitation in 2013 for removal of dredge material from transfer sites located in Upper Mississippi River Pool 4. Traditionally the Corps has awarded contracts for this type of activity via an invitation for bid (IFB) that provided detailed plans and specifications regarding the method, route and ultimate destination for the material to be removed. The Corps is currently considering alternate methods of accomplishing the removal of material from the transfer sites. One of the methods being considered is a sealed bid solicitation that specifies a performance requirement to remove and dispose of a given volume of material to a location (or for a use) identified and determined by the contractor. Upon removal of the dredged material, the contractor would take title to the material to be disposed of and is free to use or dispose of the material in any lawful manner. The traditional disposal sites provided by the Government <strong>would not</strong> be available for use by the contractor. This alternative solicitation method would leave it to the contractor to determine the most cost effective method of disposing of the material appropriately. The contractor would be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and approvals to dispose of the materials removed or put them into some other use.<br /><br />Regardless of the method of removal, the Corps is still required to evaluate the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of undertaking this work. It is anticipated that the Corps will prepare an environmental assessment which will consider, among other things, the reasonably foreseeable means by which the material will be transported from its present location to mainstream commerce (i.e. commercial port, rail or highway) or disposal facility. To assist our preparation of the appropriate environmental documentation, the Corps will be seeking information from interested parties regarding potential means of removal and transportation of the dredged material and general information regarding its ultimate use or disposal location.<br /><br />As part of this input process, the Corps will provide additional information regarding the characteristics of the material to be removed. That information will made available on an "as is" basis for the benefit of potential bidders and the Corps of Engineers does not warrant that all the material will be as described nor the suitability or marketability of the material to be removed for any particular purpose. We anticipate making that information available on or about January 7, 2013. The Corps will also issue a brief survey to gather some general information regarding interest in the material and general removal and transportation methods. The Corps is also interested in receiving additional information that the industry believes the Government should consider in structuring this solicitation.<br /><br />This notice does not constitute a solicitation. This announcement and the information gathering associated with it are for planning purposes only. The acquisition methods for this project and others of a similar nature have not yet been determined. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any interested party for costs incurred for providing a response to this request. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used by the Government to help determine the scope of its environmental review and will likely be incorporated, at least in generic form, into our environmental documents. Information provided may also be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Those responding to this survey are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge or provide feedback to any information submitted under this notice.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Palmetto GBA under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0002Z in the amount of $12,699 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The work to be performed is aligned within the core scope of duties; however, the contractor is being directed to perform additional work. MACs shall enter data into the HITECH Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12 month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted, MACs shall update the data in FISS within five business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet arrested and received their initial payment). In addition, MACs shall review and determine an allowable amount for critical access hospital incentive payments, once submitted by the hospital. MACs shall complete its review and enter the allowable amount in FISS within 30 days of receipt of the documentation.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br>  <br>  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Total Reverse Shoulder replacement implants System needed for a non-routine surgery.   <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services:  Total Reverse Shoulder is used for surgical treatment for Shoulder replacement implants.     <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited:  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a) (2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.  Price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5.

The Total Reverse Shoulder System must be received for a non-routine surgery scheduled on 1 February 2013.  If the physician does not have this System during surgery, it could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission.  <br>  <br> 6.

<AWARDEE>BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON INC.;8283 GREENSBORO DR;MCLEAN;VA;221024904
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:
As directed by VA leadership, the Paperless Initiative is an aggressive, large scale, complex program to transform VBA claims processing and benefits delivery for all five VBA business lines from the current paper-driven processes to paperless processes by the end of 2012. 
To support this major initiative, VA will award four major technology contracts. Contracts will be awarded for (1) a Lead Systems Integrator Contractor (LSIC), (2) a Program Management (PM) Support Contractor, (3) an Application Development Contractor (ADC), and (4) an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Contractor. Although core business processes must be automated to the fullest extent possible, the true benefit of any significant change effort comes from business transformation. It is simply not enough to automate existing business processes. 
Because of the importance of business transformation to the Paperless Initiative, VBA procured a Business Transformation Contractor (BTC) to develop and implement VBA business transformation activities. Business transformation is a process that takes the strategic business vision for products, services, and processes and turns this vision into a commitment and plan for execution. It involves new ways of thinking to fulfill strategic objectives-new ways to rethink customer needs to enhance the veteran's experience with VBA. Transforming VBA into a world-class customer service provider - one that is completely veteran-centric - requires more than just providing technologies for imaging and data processing. 
Advances in the health care and technology industries may offer significant opportunities for improvement to VBA's business processes. Examples of these are as follows: 
"	Intelligent analysis of data used to evaluate information and determine appropriate actions 
"	Enterprise portal service for veterans 
"	Rules-based business processing 
"	Complete and accurate information at intake, including electronic medical records from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and other medical sources 
"	Ability to identify sensitive claims and prioritize them in the decision-making queue 
"	Intelligent medical evidence (data-not just images) 
"	Automatic medical status updates that can be used to monitor changes to the veteran that might impact the decision process 
"	Case analysis tools 
"	Electronic hearings 
In addition, many of the potential business improvements involve little or no technology. They are strictly business decisions. Other potential improvements may require technological changes to implement. Examples of these improvements include: 
"	Centralizing and/or contracting the printing and mailing of notices/letters 
"	Centralizing mail intake operations 
"	Centralizing functions such as special claims (e.g., asbestos, radiation, post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD) 
"	Separating generalist and specialist roles 
"	Making organizational changes to achieve operational efficiencies 
"	Implementing policy changes that could be revised or eliminated to streamline the claims process 
"	Processing claims versus processing issues 
"	Back-scanning paper folders 
"	Standardizing access management 
"	Providing consistent, easy-to-use, and reliable services through the media of the veteran's choice to enhance the veteran-centric experience 
The initial transformation from current paper-intensive processing to fully electronic processing is just the first step in true business transformation. The BTC will develop and implement business transformation opportunities-some of which may require VA policy and/or legislative changes and some of which may require technology and/or business changes. The BTC will also implement business transformation activities that will move VBA closer to its goal of becoming a world-class provider of services to veterans. In addition, the BTC will develop and execute all strategic plans necessary to ensure that end users and business owners are prepared to successfully implement business transformation activities.

BTC CONTRACT HISTORY:
The Department of Veterans Affairs awarded contract number VA798-P-0011 for this requirement in February 2009 for initial funding of $4,350,564.  Option Year 1 was exercised in January 2010 for additional funding of $5,084,307.  Option Year 2 was exercised in January 2011 for additional funding of $4,990,549.  Option Year 3 was exercised in February 2012 for additional funding of $4,887,624.  Funding for Option Year 4 will be $4,839,589.13, or 20.9% of the total estimated contract value of $23,148,880.
