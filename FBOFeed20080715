<DESC>Mission Planning Systems provides the warfighter with the tools to plan missions and transfer required data to the aircraft avionics.  Warfighters use mission planning systems to plan missions, from training to combat missions -- including weapon delivery and airdrops.  Mission planning systems allows the planner to bring in data, such as maps, photos, weather, and platform performance and graphically or textually work within the mission planning system to develop a specific plan.  The plan can be developed alone or in collaboration with planners for other elements of the mission, depending on the specifics of the tasking or mission.  At the end of this process, the planner will have a plan and the printed or electronic materials needed for the executing platform to accomplish the mission.  Typical output will include printed material for the platform operators, such as charts, communications data, flight plan, etc., and electronic material which may be loaded into a D! ata Transfer Device (DTD) for transfer of essential mission data, such as target data for weapons, missile flight paths, aircraft flight plan, etc., to platform internal electronics.  For unmanned aircraft or missiles, the electronic data may be the only output.  Mission Planning Systems consists of common hardware and software components required by every platform as well as individual platform-specific hardware and software components.  Platform-specific components include hardware that allows the system to write or read to a DTD or software for modeling a specific platform.  The Air Force has three legacy systems: the Mission Planning System [Unix-MPS] which runs on a UNIX operating system with SunSPARC hardware, Portable Flight Planning Software [PFPS] which runs on the Windows operating system, and AMC's Advanced Computer Flight Plan [ACFP] which runs its client on the Windows operating system and its servers on DEC ALPHA hardware running Tru64 UNIX.  The Mission Pla! nning Systems program will replace these legacy systems with a single common system (JMPS) that allows collaborative planning.  JMPS is interoperable through standardized data formats, operates on common commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems and hardware, tailors operations by adding or deleting components without doing entire system re-installs, improves efficiency by combining common functions into shared common components (CCs), and enables net-centric operations.

<DESC>The Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) on behalf of the Department of Army, Office of the Chief Public Affairs, intends to award a sole source contract to L-3 Communications/MPRI , for procurement of Strategic Communication Support Services, as a follow-on bridge contract for 6 months.  Period of performance will start on 01 August 2008.  The Army must clearly communicate complex messages to many diverse audiences on a wide range of topics. Effectively communicating about sustaining, preparing, resetting and transforming the Army during an era of persistent conflict is absolutely essential to obtaining the resources required to support Soldiers and Families.  This bridge contract is essential to maintaining the continuity and quality of critical ongoing projects.  Any change in contractor at this point will result in loss of productivity and unacceptable quality of the finished products currently under revision and publication.  Duplication of efforts and time to bring a new contractor up to speed will result in missed milestones for delivery of key products to the Army and Congress.  An example is the Army Posture Statement, which must be delivered in early February for Congressional budget testimony by the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff.   The current contractor is fully engaged in meeting current short-term critical project milestones, and awarding this bridge contract to another contractor will jeopardize completion of those projects and create the risk of mission failure.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by 22 July 2008, 9:00 am.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract upon review of the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. See note 22.  The Point of Contact for this notice is Darlene Ferrare, ferrada@hqda.army.mil.

Evaluation

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award the Purchase Order to other than the quoter with the lowest price.  The evaluation of quotes will be based upon a complete assessment of the quoter’s quote. The factors will be evaluated as described below on a 
greatest value basis.  Selection will be determined on the basis of the following:

            (1)        How well a proposal satisfies the evaluation criteria below,

(2)        The strengths, weaknesses and risks a quote presents to the Government; and

(3)        Evaluation of the quotes relative to the proposed prices to the quote(s).

Basis for Award: Award will be made to that offeror whose quote/proposal contains the combination of criteria offering the best overall value to the government in accordance with FAR Part 15.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of the technical features with differences in the offeror's’ prices.  In making this comparison the government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price.  The criteria are presented in descending order of importance. These should be related to the requirements in the Statement of Work.  These factors are all of equal importance.  The Government may make award without conducting discussions.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1. Technical Background, Knowledge & Experience, is broken down as follows:
               
a.	Certification and accreditation of Synergistics Technologies is critical.
b.	Provide evidence of technical background and in-depth knowledge of security, procedures, operations and cutting-edge technologies.
c.	Experience with development and implementation of security policies is mandatory.
d.	Multiple years of network administration, including hands-on security experience with various tools and techniques.
e.	Must have significant experience in the installation process of pulling wire.
f.	Must have significant experience dealing with retrofit situations.
g.	Must have successful track record of providing complete integrated security solutions with 24 hour monitoring service, including remote Internet video, fire, burglar, card & door access.
h.	Experience track record with similarly sized government agencies and private corporations.

Past Performance is broken down as follows:

a. 	Specific evidence of capability, such as whether a contractor adhered to specifications, whether items were delivered on schedule, and whether services were provided correctly the first time. 
        
Non-Price factors combined or individually are significantly more important than Price.

Price will be evaluated in comparison to all offers received in response to the request for quote and Government Estimate.  

Past performance will be rated Neutral if the offeror has no record of Past Performance.

EVALUATION RATINGS

The Government will evaluate technical proposal information/responses.  Each rating area will be assigned one of four ratings as listed below. The sub factors will also be assigned a rating. The offeror may also be rated Neutral in the area of Past Performance. Factors 1, 2 and 3 will be rated according to the below criteria.  Adjectival technical scoring will be as follows

RATING GUIDANCE

Quoters’ responses to the factors will be rated using the following scale:

<a href="mailto:tina.kubik@wvchar.ang.af.mil">130 AW/LGC</a>
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Yeager Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located in Charleston West Virginia, to American Electric Power (AEP).  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. AEP (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: Yeager ANGB is home to the 130th Airlift Wing, which provides staff and operational support for C-130H aircraft. Yeager ANGB is located at Charleston West Virginia and has a total of 74.8 acres under lease.  Of this total, 43 acres are located on top of the hill on which the airport was built.  Most of this area has been developed.  Any expansion requires relocation of existing buildings to other areas, using vehicle parking areas, or acquiring additional land.  The lower portion of the base has been developed along the access road to the airfield.  This section contains approximately 33 acres.  Development has been on benches made from leveling hill tops or cutting into the side of hills.  The developed area in this lower section covers 9.3 acres.  The remainder is made up of hillsides and ravines which are expensive to develop.  The apron and taxiway at Yeager Airport were built in 1949.  The first facilities built were Building 101-Base Supply, Building 107-Maintenance Hangar, and Building 102-Headquarters in 1951.  The base currently has 31 buildings with a total square footage of 295,051.   Approximately 50% of the Yeager ANGBS electrical distribution system is already privatized.  The 50% of the system still maintained by Yeager ANG is a Y configured electrical system feeding the older portion of the bases flight line and aircraft maintenance facilities.  This entire section of the system was completely rewired in Nov 1999 and contains 5 electrical vaults, 2 wood utility poles, 6 oil filled pad mounted transformers and one dry transformer, and approximately 1700 feet of underground wiring.  At the same time this was done all transformers were inspected and oils tested and found to be in good operating condition.  The system is composed of underground feeders, pad mounted transformers, and power distribution breaker panels that feed various building.  Yeager ANG Base is fed and metered from one primary meter location and has no power generation capabilities except for emergency backup generators that fall outside the scope of this utility's privatization.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received; this notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Bruker Optics in Billerica, MA for the purchase of a V80/v FTIR Spectrometer.
 
*** Sole Source determination is based on the need to maintain 100 percent compatibility with NIST’s existing Bruker Spectrometers. The existing systems will be integrated with the new Bruker system to cover another region of the optical spectrum and microscopic samples. In addition, parts and accessories will be interchangeable between the existing spectrometers and the new spectrometer.  This is a follow-on procurement as defined in FAR Part 6.302-1(ii)(A). 

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary 
rationale for Sole Source Determination.
 (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in 
the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of 
a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components 
thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to 
be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. 

No other manufacturer has a commercially available system that would be 100 percent compatible with NIST’s existing equipment and software.  Bruker Optics is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this equipment.

<a href="mailto:Schuller.Nicole@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking contractors to provide monitoring services for the acquisition of speciated atmospheric mercury data from sites across the country.  Over the past 5 years, a number of states and academic mercury scientists havebeen measuring speciated atmospheric mercury at sites located throughout the United States and Canada.  While most measurements are generally based on automated and/or manual methods as described by Landis et al., 2002, the specific protocols by which measurements are taken can vary across sites, and in some instances, are undocumented.  Thus, accurately comparing measurement data across sites is currently a significant challenge.  Common protocols for mercury sampling and analysis are needed to facilitate the site data inter comparison over time.  Moreover, a centralized archive for data distribution is needed to enable mercury policy assessments, evaluate and improve mercury deposition models, and enhance mercury research. To meet some of the mercury data and information needs, EPA is collaborating with mercury scientific community, including the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) membership of federal agencies, states, tribes, academic institutions, and other organizations to establish a new, national, standardized network to monitor mercury in the atmosphere.  The network seeks to measure air concentrations of mercury in its gaseous and particulate forms, event-based mercury wet deposition, and meteorological and land-cover variables needed for estimating dry deposition fluxes.  The network envisioned will serve many functions: 1) facilitate the calculation of wet, dry, and total deposition; 2) provide data for evaluating predictive and diagnostic models and for assessing source-receptor relationships; and 3) build a data set for analyzing spatial and temporal trends. Under this FAR Part 13 acquisition, the contractor shall provide mercury monitoring services, such as the operation of Tekran mercury analyzers (2537A, 1130, 1135) to produce and distribute to EPA datasets of raw and validated atmospheric mercury concentrations in speciated forms: elemental, reactive gaseous, and particulate, and meteorology.  EPA also requires a quality assurance plan and associated documentation for all aspects of data collection, as required by EPA Order 53601.A2. Awards shall be based on best value for the Government.  Interested parties should navigate to EPA's website http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0800220/index.htm to view the Statement of Work and Evaluation Factors. Offerors should continue to monitor EPA's website for any amendments to the postings.

As a result of this event EPA will purchase electronic copies of all presentations, and a copy of any journal articles presented at the workshop, and a copy of the prepared workshop proceedings The CRC mobile air toxics workshop is the only event of its kind that brings together many experts from around the world from industry, academia, research organizations, and government entities (Federal, State, and Local government entities) involved in the study of emissions characterization and air quality modeling of air toxic emissions from mobile sources.  The CRC workshop is also the only event to offer such a wide range of topics directly related to the work that EPA OTAQ and ORD do.  The Participation of experts from around the world in the topics mentioned above provides EPA with a unique opportunity for the sharing and the discussion of new ideas, research methods, and technology to further the goal of improving EPA regulatory programs resulting in air quality improvements. The data compiled from this workshop will serve as an evaluation tool for EPA Mobile source regulations for air toxics.  CRC is the only organization of its kind in the country that acts as a national hub for conducting and coordinating research involving mobile source emissions including that on air toxic emissions.  . NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered.

<DESC><p>Scope of Work: Prepare documentation and datasets for archiving the Annual Parole Survey and Annual Probation Survey (P and P) for the years 2000 through 2005. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has conducted the P and P surveys annually since the mid-1990s. The parole survey is administered to about 54 respondents, and the probation survey is administered to about 460 respondents. Data tables and reports have been published from the surveys, and unpublished data tables are made available by request from BJS. The objective of this project is to prepare documentation and datasets that BJS can use to archive P and P data at the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD). The documentation and datasets to be prepared cover six years of P and P data, covering the surveys administered from 2000 through 2005. The project consists of three major components: (1) preparing ASCII datasets containing State-level responses to the two surveys; (2) creating a &ldquo;notes&rdquo; database, consisting of data notes provided by respondents who completed the surveys and specific notes made by the data collector; and (3) creating documentation for archiving the data. Materials: BJS will provide the consultant with data and documentation necessary to complete the tasks. BJS will provide the consultant with spreadsheets containing the probation and parole data received from respondents; copies of the original survey forms on which respondents and the data collector have written notes related to their responses; and additional information about the surveys in documentation (a &ldquo;noteslist.doc&rdquo; file) provided by BJS. Copies of the forms used to conduct the 2005 Annual Probation and Parole surveys can be found on the BJS website at: 2005 Annual Probation Survey http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cj8_05.pdf 2005 Annual Parole Survey http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cj7_05.pdf Sample publication and statistical tables produced from these surveys can be found at: Probation and Parole in the United States, 2006 http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ppus06.htm</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The EXPRESS program provides advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel necessary to perform) in support of the U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command (AMCOM) and its customers.<BR><BR>The EXPRESS program consists of four (4) domains in which services may be ordered:  Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical.  Representative BPAs (including Statements of Work) as well as other EXPRESS information may be found on the EXPRESS website  located at https://redstoneappsrv1.redstone.army.mil/acweb/acwebdba.acweb_home_child?p_link_id=83.   <BR><BR>In June 2007, AMCOM issued a Request for Information (RFI) to survey the commercial services market for potential small business firms with the capabilities and interest in participating as a prime contractor/team leader in the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) Program.  Multiple responses were received as a result of the RFI.  The Government assessed these responses on a domain-by-domain basis, and determined that capable small business prime contractors/team leaders exist to warrant the conduct of a competition in each domain.  The Government intends to award the following BPAs in the domains noted:  B&A two, Logistics  three, Programmatic   three, and Technical   five.  These are estimated numbers only.  The Government reserves the right to vary the number of awards depending on the number of responsive proposals submitted.  Eligibility to compete for the anticipated BPA awards is limited to those small businesses who hold one of the required GSA schedules and who meet the size standards for the NAICS applicable to that schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program. Respondents may seek consideration as a prime/team leader in more than one domain.  <BR><BR>Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules at the time it responds to the Request for Quotation (RFQ):  871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Information Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers.  Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to the RFQ.  However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the majority of the domain requirements must be identified.  Companies interested in obtaining a GSA schedule, or expediting a schedule application that has been submitted may contact the local representative, Steve Sizemore via email at steve.sizemore@gsa.gov.<BR><BR>If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents schedule by GSA will apply.  If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541330 and a size standard of $25M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain.  If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $25M will apply to all domains.  If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified.  The NAICS and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply.  <BR><BR>Respondents are cautioned that failure to meet the following criteria will render their submission non-responsive, and they will not be considered for award:  (1) Must hold one of the required GSA schedules, as of the date of submission of quote, (2) Must meet the small business size standard for the NAICS applicable to the schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program, (3) Submission of all required documentation as stated in the RFQ.<BR><BR>The Requests for Quotation (RFQs) will be posted on the EXPRESS website,  approximately 30 days from the date of this notice.  Responses to the RFQs will be due approximately 30 days after the RFQ issue date  to the following address:  COMMANDER, U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSAM-AC-OS-O/Marcia Tully, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address.  Late submissions will not be considered.  <BR><BR>Questions/answers for the initial RFQ in 2004 are applicable to this RFQ.  These Q&As are located on the EXPRESS website.  Any additional questions regarding this RFQ shall be submitted electronically to RFQ Questions and Answers on the EXPRESS website.  <BR>

The Tank and Automotive Command of the US Army has requirements to provide comprehensive maintenance , training, and spare parts upon a fleet of Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems (VACIS) currently located in South West Asia (SWA) theater of operations, for a 3-year period starting in August 2008.

The International Harvester truck bed that carries the inspection equipment is also included in the maintenance plan and the source sought will be responsible for acquiring and providing the necessary spare parts and consumables required for routine preventative maintenance and unscheduled repairs due to break down for the truck as well as for the inspection devices and systems.  The VACIS are scattered throughout SWA and movement from one location to another may require armed security escorts.

<DESC>Introduction<BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The Project Director, Installation Management Systems  Army/Military Entrance Processing Command (PD IMS-A/MEPCOM) is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Information Technology (IT), tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and /or operational capabilities described in this RFI.  The PD IMS-A/MEPCOM will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential IT solutions.  The proposed NAICS Code for this work is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.<BR>This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government on its eventual acquisition approach.  All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and Market Research purposes only.  The PD IMS-A/MEPCOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the PD IMS-A/MEPCOM evaluation of the information received.  <BR>Overview<BR>The US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) is responsible for determining the physical, mental, and moral qualifications of candidates for enlistment into the Armed Forces of the United States.  As such, USMEPCOM is an integral and essential part of the military recruiting and personnel systems of the Military Services, because the command serves as an entry point for much of the information that supports recruiting, training, and management of the nations war fighting resources.  The USMEPCOM, through the PD IMS-A/MEPCOM, is currently engaged in efforts to transform its business processes and operational environment through the creation of the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).  The capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel information across the Command and the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) is critical to fulfilling the USMEPCOM mission.  VIPS will modernize and enhance the IT capabilities of USMEPCOM through the collection, evaluation, validation, and exchanges of enlistee qualification information during peacetime and mobilization.  <BR>Technical Objectives<BR>The VIPS system will be based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that will enable the electronic capture of required applicant qualification data; make accession data fully, appropriately, and securely available to applicants and accession partners (i.e., Recruiting and Training Commands); enable full compliance with the Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a paperless, net-centric environment, electronically providing data to official DoD health [Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)] and human resources [Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS)]; and take advantage of automated data capture technology (i.e., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results).  When VIPS is implemented, USMEPCOM's role in the ACOI will change from carrying out the execution of qualifying processes and activities to verifying qualification information and serving as an information broker and provider to ACOI partners and secondary stakeholders.  <BR>The USMEPCOM of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free and highly automated.  In this environment VIPS data will be readily available and easily shared with ACOI and stakeholder organizations, dramatically improving the effectiveness and efficiency of manning the Armed Forces.<BR>Corporate Capabilities<BR>A clear comprehension of corporate capabilities is needed.  Please provide a company profile which includes the company DUNS number, past and current clients, and available facilities (i.e., lab).  <BR>Industry/System Capabilities<BR>Information is sought regarding design and integration of an interoperable paper-less accessioning system that will be adopted as the information broker for candidate qualification into the military service.  Please provide a model/framework for system design using the following technology capabilities which meet DoD Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid (GIG), Modular Open System Approach (MOSA), Interoperability, and Information Assurance (IA) Standards/Tenets:<BR>"	Portal Services<BR>"	Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES)<BR>"	Service Oriented Architecture<BR>o	Records Management<BR>o	Medical Assessment<BR>o	Security Assessment<BR>"	Data Security with emphasis on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) security<BR>"	Secure Accessibility (VPN, PKI, Biometrics) <BR>"	Business Intelligence<BR>"	Network/System Operations and Management<BR>"	Video Teleconferencing (VTC)<BR>"	Wireless Technology & Security<BR>"	Workflow Management<BR>Please illustrate the following:<BR><BR>"	Explanation of the proposed framework to fully explore your approach.<BR>"	How the framework will integrate these functionalities and theorize system description.<BR>"	How the framework is relevant or how the proposed functionalities are integrated.<BR>"	Current capabilities and examples in the creation of a SOA NCES integrated framework in the DoD/Federal environment.<BR>"	How you would apply Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) or another process improvement model/framework to your approach.  Include your CMMI level if applicable.  <BR>"	Information/overview on your proposed Contingency Operation Plan/Disaster Recovery (COOP/DR) services.<BR>"	An overview of your proposed management approach.<BR>"	Gross/order-of-magnitude estimated cost of the proposed system.<BR>Instructions<BR>All responses, comments and questions must be submitted electronically to Graham.Evans@us.army.mil.  No telephonic discussions will be held. Please limit your response to no more than 20 pages.   Responses are due in PowerPoint and/or MS Word format by 4:00 PM EDT on Thursday, August 14, 2008.

<DESC>Introduction:  This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to act as a Medicare Payment Contractor as per Sec. 204 Medicare Medical Home Demonstration Project of H.R. 6111, Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006.  In addition, the Contractor will be responsible to verify beneficiary participant eligibility on a monthly basis and to provide customer service support and education to the Medical Home practices.     

The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) DOES NOT INTEND TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to conduct a Medical Home Demonstration as directed by Section 204 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA).  The Act calls for the project to provide targeted, accessible, continuous and coordinated family-centered care to high-need populations through a Medical Home Demonstration.  The Act also specifies that the demonstration will include Medicare beneficiaries who are deemed to be “high need” (that is, with multiple chronic or prolonged illnesses that require regular medical monitoring, advising or treatment.)  

Current statistics reveal that 86 percent of the over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries have one or more chronic conditions and 23 percent have five or more chronic conditions.  The current healthcare system is ill-equipped to handle a rapidly growing population of senior-aged baby boomers who will enjoy increased longevity, as well as increased chronicity.  It is estimated that, by the year 2015, 150 million Americans will have at least one chronic condition.  This wave of new chronically ill patients will further tax an already strained system of healthcare provision and payment.  At a time of increased demand on the system, there is strong evidence that there is a countervailing force at work on the delivery side.  Fewer newly educated physicians are entering primary care and seasoned physicians, feeling pressure to see more patients in less time, are retiring or moving to other fields.

In a 1992 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposed a definition and model for the Medical Home.  The AAP pioneered Medical Home in the early 1990’s with children and their families.  Since that time, their proposed model was generally accepted and implemented in pediatric practices throughout the nation.  The AAP believes that all children should have a Medical Home where care is accessible, family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and culturally effective.  There are few other practical examples of Medical Home care to observe and most involve medical care for children.  Examples of other Medical Home models include the American Academy of Family Practice’s (AAFP’s) “TransforMED”, and the Carolina ACCESS program which is a Medical Home for children under Medicaid managed care.

Other professional and specialty and subspecialty groups, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Practice (AAFP), the American Geriatrics Society, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and the American Heart Association have also called for changes in the provision and payment for chronic care.  Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home, (March, 2007) a position paper developed by the AAP, AAFP, American College of Physicians, and AOA, calls for a physician-directed medical practice with a personal physician providing continuous and comprehensive care across all elements of the complex health care system, utilizing a whole person orientation.

<ARCHDATE>07262008
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The National Marine Fisheries Service intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dr. Michael L. Parrack to conduct analyses of fishery and related data associated with its seabird bycatch and FATE modeling projects. Michael Parrack was a fishery stock analyst for the National Marine Fisheries Service for approximately 30 years. During that time, he conducted stock analysis on many fishery species; however his principal group was the penaeid species, which occupied his activities at NMFS for at least 10 years. He was chief of the unit that analyzed both fishery dependent and fishery independent data on penaeid species, including pink shrimp. He was a senior fishery scientist at NMFS, applying Bayesian methods to protected species bycatch issues, before recently retiring several months ago. He completed an innovative analysis and manuscript on the sea turtle bycatch and also had begun an analysis of the seabird bycatch at the time of his departure. This previous work, including his familiarity with both the Pelagic Observe Program (POP) and logbook data files, makes him the most cost effective provider for NMFS in the seabird bycatch part of this procurement. Dr. Parrack is listed as a principal investigator on the Fisheries and the Environment Program (FATE) project and helped to prepare the proposal that led to receipt of funding from the FATE program by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). This procurement will allow him to carry through with the work planned for him under the FATE proposal. His participation was important to acceptance of the proposal by the FATE program, in which the inclusion of an investigator experienced in stock analysis was the key to a successful proposal. Dr. Parrack's participation is essential to both the seabird bycatch and FATE pink shrimp projects. He has previous knowledge and experience planning both projects and is familiar with the large, complex databases that must be analyzed in both of these projects makes him the logical choice for this procurement.
<p>An estimate of th total seabird catch of the US North Atlantic pelagic longline fleet in 2007 is the immediate objective of this project. A second objective is to develop estimates of the total seabird catch in several previous years for comparison to previous estimates using another method. The limited and highly clustered distribution of the bycatch in the observer data in 2007 and some previous years present complications to estimation. It is anticipated that period-of-record data will have to be used to acquire a valid estimates. POP data haS been collected since 1992.Logbook data also are available for that period. The recently implemented (August 2004) mandated change in gear use (i.e., prohibition of J-shaped hooks, leading to universal use of circle hooks) further complicates estimation based on the data record. Previous analysis suggests that seabird catches are lower on circle hooks in relation to effort with circle hooks, than would be expected by chance. There are nine fishing zones in the POP and logbook database. <br /><br />Pink Shrimp: The Tortugas shrimp stock, both on the fishing and spawning grounds and in other parts of its ontogenetic range, is the focus of this part of the procurement. This part of the procurement is to support a collaboration of the provider with other principal investigators in the FATE project being conducted by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center. The FATE project will integrate biology and oceanography into a series of models that will quantify the influence of coastal processes, weather, and water management on fishery production. Results will be used to develop physical and biological indicators of postlarval recruitment into Florida Bay and a fishery recruitment index for use in stock assessment. The contractor will include (1) analysis of Tortugas pink shrimp catch and effort data and (2) participation in the integration of other information produced in the project into the analysis. Along with this involvement will be the major responsibility of providing guidance and advise to the other project scientists on the type and form of information that can most effectively improve estimates of stock status and projections of stock sustainability in the face of variability in environmental influences and fishing pressure.</p>
<p>DESC: The required work will consist of the following:</p>
<p>Analysis of databases on fishery catch and effort is a major component of this procurement. Experience in determining the status of fishery stocks is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Seabird Bycatch: SEFSC Pelagic Observer Program records will be analyzed and used to estimate total incidental takes of seabirds in the pelagic longline fishery. Observer Program stratification (fishing zones) will be followed as closely as practical. Zones in which no bird catches have been observed may be excluded. A Bayesian type of analysis and estimation method will be conducted. Total seabird catch per unit of effort and mortalities per unit of effort will be determined from observer reports through calendar year 2007. Analyses will be conducted to the lowest taxonomic group feasible, recognizing that this may be only "seabird" or "alive vs. dead" birds. Changes in the fishery (i.e., mandated change to exclusively use circle hooks, rather than either circle or j-shaped hooks), beginning August 2004, may complicate the analysis and reduce the number of years for which the total bird bycatch is estimated. Set is the effort unit to be used in the analysis. In previous work, which also used set as the effort unit, separated hauls were associated with sets based on start or end date and time of the haul. Set is a better measure of effort than hook because the hooks on a set are not independent from each other and often several birds are caught on the same set. Hooks and sets may be well correlated; however the relationship may differ spatially. The presentation of information should include bycatch rates in terms of hooks as well as sets because this is the form in which both scientists and managers are accustomed to seeing bycatch information. Ecological factors or fishery practices that lead to higher catches of certain species may also favor a bycatch of seabirds, and knowledge of associations should be developed and potentially exploited both to better estimate the seabird bycatch and possibly recommend approaches to decreasing the seabird bycatch.</p>
<p>Pink Shrimp: Ensuring the applicability of the products of the FATE project in analyses of stock status and stock sustainability will be the main responsibility of this provider. The contractor will collaborate in the development of a 10-yr time series of recruitment indices and will examine the time series in relation to fishery data. In an iterative process with the other project scientists, the provider will determine the most potentially effective indices for predicting fishery recruitment and stock production. This will culminate in a design, to be described by the contractor, for application of the information developed by the models into a stock-assessment framework. The contractor will participate in preparing reports and deliverables that describe the appropriate application of the recruitment indices to stock evaluation.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is date of award through one year.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>This requirement is a non-commercial contract. Award will be made in the form of a Stand-alone, to one responsible offeror. A firm fixed-Price (FFP) type contract is anticipated for this effort with a Period of Performance of less than one year.  However, the Government encourages interested offeror to provide feedback on a suggested Contract Type other than Firm Fixed Price that would increase efficiency and/or maximize performance. The anticipated basic contract will specify the requirements to be delivered in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  NAWCTSD has received tasking to research the feasibility of a contract to replace the visual projector system of the Full Mission Bridge Simulator at the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS), Newport, RI.  This trainer, the Conning Officer Virtual Environment Full Mission Bridge (COVE FMB), provides a simulated ship's bridge with a 360 degree horizontal field of view of the marine environment using 12 Barco Sim 4 projectors in a 5:4 aspect at 1280x1024 raster. The purpose of this sources sought posting is to replace the Sim 4 projectors with new state of the art, 3 chip digital light processor (DLP) or liquid crystal on silicone (LCOS) projectors.  Also, as part of this upgrade, it requires the design and installation of a support structure to hold the projectors located above the pilot house mock-up that must be based from the concrete floor and not the raised deck.  A metal or other high strength non-shifting material is required to be used to build this support structure.  The intent of the support structure requirement is to increase the rigidity of the projector mounting and decrease the vibration induced from the mock up bridge structure, to prevent miss alignment of the projectors.  This trainer is located indoors in a climate controlled space (please see attachment).  

The performance of the display upgrade is expected to change for the better in comparison to the existing display system, to include resolution, contrast, brightness, color matching, edge blending, and uniformity across all display channels. Automated tools are to be included for the maintenance and alignment of the display system. As part of the installation, instruction shall be provided to the on site maintenance personnel at SWOS in set-up and maintenance of the new projector system.  A warranty is also desired for the performance of the projectors and components of this upgrade, to include, but not limited to mechanical defects.  Multi-year warranties or maintenance plans are preferred.   All warranties must be transferable to the Government.

The overall tasking will include selection, procurement, installation, testing, design, documentation, and integration of a complete display system to include integration with the COVE FMB training system software (Computer Science Corporation’s Vship).  

Responses to this notice shall include narrative identifying the scope of past and present (within the last 3 years), relevant experience on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact), a description of core capabilities relating to the performance of the subject effort.  Additionally, interested parties should submit a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) identifying a suggested Contract Line Items scheme, which estimates pricing for each recommended deliverable. All interested parties shall specify the current business size of their company.


Information should be sent via e-mail david.yarde@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods by mail to: NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN: Code 25331 (D. Yarde), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275. Responses are requested by 29 July 2008 (14 calendar days). The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, David Yarde, via email at david.yarde@navy.mil or by telephone at 407.380.4086.

<DESC><p><br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES FOR MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
<p><br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>To significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of notifications for the 48th Fighter Wing leadership and base decision makers.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Command Post currently does not possess a mass notification system. The current system in use by the Command Post is a web-based system capable of reaching only SMS capable devices (SMS cell phone, pager, PDA, email). The system is very time consuming and labor intensive to input data. Further, the system does not offer feedback capability to inform the sender of who was contacted. Finally, the current system is fee-per-call based which would generate significant costs if used daily for base-wide notifications.</p>
<p>According to USAFEI 10-207: "The maximum number of initial calls will not exceed seven per controller". The Command Post has numerous scenarios requiring seven or more notifications per controller. Without mass notification capability, this requirement can and has extended notifications in excess of twenty-five minutes. This in turn delays vital information reaching key decision makers and leads to inaccurate reporting of information.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The 48th Fighter Wing Command Post desires to create and execute a strategy to vastly improve notification efficiency and accuracy in regard to events or incidents affecting the installation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>While Offerors have complete flexibility to propose their own solutions, their proposed Contract Work Statement must include a comprehensive strategy for achieving the following objectives:</p>
<p><br />&bull;System Capabilities / Requirements:</p>
<p>System must have the capability for the creation and storage of numerous pre-canned scenarios (100+)</p>
<p>Must have capability to use existing telephone system. Must not use a remote call center with charge per call fees.</p>
<p>Must have capability to contact numerous electronic devices (cell phones, SMS, pager, fax, home phone, email, and PDAs).</p>
<p>Must have capability to send multiple notifications simultaneously.</p>
<p>&bull;Feedback / Reporting:</p>
<p>Must have feedback capability to report who was and was not contacted.</p>
<p>&bull;Installation Requirements:</p>
<p>System must be Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified to operate on Air Force telephone systems/networks (AFI 33-111 Voice Systems Management paras 7.9 and 9.1.2.. and Attachment 6).</p>
<p>System must be a system approved by the Air Force Communications Agency's and DISA's DITSCAP/DIACAP system prior to use on Air Force network (AFI 33-202 Volume 1 Network and Computer Security, Chapter 6).</p>
<p>System must be able to interface with the standard desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>System must be able to operate on Air Force standard network architecture and not use excessive bandwidth.</p>
<p>&bull;Training:</p>
<p>Must provide initial notification scenario set-up assistance and training.</p>
<p>&bull;Maintenance:</p>
<p>Must have capability to be maintained by local communication support function (Comm Sq, CP, etc.)</p>
<p>Must have 24hr customer support service offered by provider.</p>
<p>Offer per incident rates for system service calls rather than annual service agreement.</p>
<p>Solution must minimize recurring costs for the life of the system. Price proposal must include future software upgrades and maintenance for a five year period following installation.</p>
<p>&bull;Not required but desired:</p>
<p>Capability to send notifications to individual desktops.</p>
<p>Capability for notification to remain on desktop until acknowledged by user.</p>
<p>Capability for Geobase (or other interface) to direct calls and notifications based on building / area affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE), is soliciting industry comments to refine the Statement of Work and Performance Specification for the Ground Radio Maintenance Automatic Test System (GRMATS).  The GRMATS is a digital, software-defined automatic radio test system.   
Current and future tactical radio procurements by Program Manager for Communications and Networking Systems (PM CNS) will be software defined ground radio communications sets that are difficult to support with the current suite of ground radio test/maintenance equipment.  Software defined radios will require software defined test measurement and diagnostic equipment to allow maintenance shops to support this equipment.  The GRMATS will be used for test and diagnostic functions for both current and future software-defined, tactical radios. 
This RFI is issued to provide industry the opportunity to review the draft Statement of Work and Performance Specification and provide comments and feedback to the below listed point of contact.  
Interested firms should submit responses to this RFI no later than 05 August 2008 to Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: Mark Sanderson, CESS, CTQ3MS, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Va.  22134.  This information may also be submitted to mark.sanderson@usmc.mil.  Interested firms should submit their business size information.   Submitted information will not be returned. All data received in response to this announcement marked or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions. Comments will not be published.   This Request for Information is provided for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), or an announcement of a solicitation.  No solicitation document exists.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

<DESC>The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is conducting market research to identify organizations that are currently performing Resource Management (RM) concepts for Integrated Solid Waste Management, or have the capability to pursue such resource efficiency opportunities.

Please refer to the Resource Management document on the WasteWise website at:   http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/wstewise/pubs/wwupda17.pdf to review the concept that the Air Force is interested in pursuing.  RM is a strategic alternative to disposal contracting that seeks to continually improve resource efficiency through enhanced source reduction, recycling, and recovery.  By tying incentives to the value of services that foster prevention, reuse, and recycling—with disposal as the last resort—RM encourages alignment of contractors’ activities with the customers’ in a new type of joint effort.  AETC is seeking innovative, efficient business practices such as RM that provide significant opportunities to obtain potential cost savings and ultimately a more resource efficient product or process design.

This RFI is completely voluntary and does not constitute any form of direction or commitment from the Government, nor will the Government be liable for any costs incurred.  This information will be used for MARKET RESEARCH PUPROSES ONLY.  Industry is not required to respond for any upcoming solicitation.  Your participation is greatly appreciated!

Please submit a white paper with your RM capabilities, or planned RM processes.  Responses are due no later than 25 Jul 2008 and shall be electronically submitted to Maj Eric Freeman at eric.freeman@randolph.af.mil (210-652-9590), and Capt Carl Jackson at carl.jackson@randolph.af.mil.  Questions relative to this RFI should also be directed to these individuals.

AS A REMINDER:
This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for Resource Management concepts.  This is NOT A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) industry group 5621 (waste collection) and 5622 (waste treatment and disposal) apply.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size, particularly if they are a small business.  “Small business” means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>USCENTCOM, 7115 S. Boundary Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5101, requires purchase of licenses and maintenance for Primavera ProSight Portfolio software. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Primavera Systems, Inc., 3 Bala Plaza West, Suite 700, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004. Primavera Systems is the exclusive Government reseller of Primavera ProSight software support required by USCENTCOM. Interested parties may e-mail cassandra.caputo-02@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Ms. Cassandra L. Caputo, no later than Friday, 25 July, 2008; 2:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>USCENTCOM requires the purchase 50 Primavera ProSight Portfolio full named user licenses and a one-year annual maintenance package for accompanying software.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Due to the brand name approved on 30 June 2008, no other potential vendors are able to provide Primavera software licenses and maintenance to the Government other than Pimavera Systems, Inc. It is not financially or technically sound or in the best interest of the government to utilize any other vendor's solution to meet the IT Portfolio and Functional Portfolio Managers requirement.</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification:<br />This is a brand name request and any vendor that can provide Primavera ProSight Portfolio licenses, maintenance and support will be considered. The Command has reviewed and researched comparable systems to ensure compatibility with the Primavera ProSight Portfolio software previously purchased. There is no other brand of software that can support a seamless integration into the existing network. It is not financially or technically sound, or in the best interest of the government, to utilize any other product solution to meet the IT Portfolio and Functional Portfolio Managers requirement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Purchase of Linear Array Genotyping and Detection Kits for Ongoing HPV Studies
<SOLNBR>00HCVHDG-2008-58340
<RESPDATE>072308
<ARCHDATE>07242008
<CONTACT>Linda M Young, Purchasing Agent, Phone (770) 488-2655, Fax (770) 488-2777, Email lml3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256-1025, to continue an ongoing project using linear array genotyping and detection kits in funded studies in human papillomavirus including the following: SUN (Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy), VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink), EDRN (Early Detection Research Network), NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), a study of HPV in screening samples from two large HMOs, and the WHO Global Reference Laboratory serving as reference laboratory for the WHO HPV Labnet. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection, and, because of its etiologic role in cervical cancer, is a significant public health issue. HPV is not a single virus, but is a family of more than 100 closely related viruses. The types vary in their predilection for infection of mucosal or squamous surfaces. There are about 40 mucosal types, with 37 being most frequently detected in the genital tract. Of these types, 22 are called “high risk” based on their detection in cancer, and 15 are “low risk” because they are rarely found in malignancies. HPV cannot be cultured in conventional systems, so studies to understand the natural history and pathogenesis of HPV require molecular testing. In order to systematically study all 37 important types of HPV, consensus PCR methods with subsequent type-specific hybridization of the product are used.  Consensus PCR uses a defined mixture of primers targeting the most conserved region of the HPV genome (L1). Type-specific detection is required to study the epidemiology, natural history and pathogenesis of the virus. In addition, since the approval of a vaccine against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, studies of the type distribution of HPV in lesions and in the general population are required to evaluate the impact of vaccination. A stable supply of commercially prepared and validated reagents is required to assure the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of HPV testing. The product required must be able to detect and type the 37 genital-tract HPV types and the same testing method must be used to assure that changes in type-distribution reflect changes in the population rather than changes in the method. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

DSCP began the conference stating that DLA’s primary goal, in researching this new support endeavor, is to improve customer support of Lumber and Plywood at the user level and to ensure World Wide Military Readiness.  In addition, DSCP requested that Industry provide input on the following:
1.	What can we (DLA) do better?
2.	What can you (business partners) do better?

DSCP presented the following information: how the Wood Products commodity is supported today both inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS and OCONUS); a detailed overview of all the challenges that the commodity must overcome in supporting the customer and in insuring that material price is the most current in a volatile market and finally, an overview of a proposed draft SOW.  
 
INDUSTRY DAY QUESTIONS:

QUESTIONS FROM INDUSTRY DURING THE BRIEF:

Question 1: Is DLA looking for total asset visibility of a requisition or total asset visibility of the vendor’s inventory?
Answer:	DLA is seeking total asset visibility of a requisition.

Question 2: Are the Historical Delivery Requirements (CONUS) on Chart 16, DLA standards or historical delivery requirements?
Answer:	The delivery days provided on slide 16 of the Wood Products Supply Chain Management Industry Day PowerPoint presentation are the standards for delivery in the Continental United States.  

Question 3:  On page 16 of the brief, DSCP only show delivery times for CONUS; what are OCONUS delivery requirements?  
Answer:	Delivery timeframes for Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) have not been determined.

Question 4:  What is wrong with what you (DSCP) are doing right now?  What is broken with the current program that needs fixed?
Answer:	DSCP is seeking to apply the Industry’s knowledge and practices to obtain the best solution for the Government and the Integrator(s) while providing our customer the right product at the right time and at the best market price.

Question 5:  What does the Government feel they are inadequate at?
Answer:	The Government is always interested in finding a better way to support Department of Defense customers both in the United States and to customers located at overseas bases.  The Government is challenged with how to capture the best market prices for the products and at the same time having the material readily available to meet the customers requirements.  Most of the wood products are readily available within the Continental United States (CONUS) however they are not easily obtained, stored or supplied to customers located outside CONUS.  Overseas support to Europe and the Middle East is currently the area where we are looking to improve support given the fluctuating prices and the logistics of getting material to all customers.

Question 6:  Will the Government provide the Vendors more demand data to reduce risk?
Answer:	The Government has the ability to provide both yearly and quarterly demand data, by customer, to the Vendors.  This is typically provided at the time a Request for Proposal is issued.







Question 7:  What is end-to-end support and/or integration?
Answer:	End-to-end support and/or integration is where a vendor is responsible for the entire support of an item or stock class.  In the case of wood products, a vendor would be responsible for supplying all lumber and plywood to all customers world wide.  All customer orders would go directly to the contractor.  It is the contractors responsibility to decide how to support the customers requirements within the required delivery timeframes.  Contractors will need to work with customers for forecasting requirements, the vendor will need to buy material in sufficient quantites or set up distribution networks so that they have material available in the required timeframes, contractors will need to arrange for storage, for transportation, packaging and maintain an information technology system that can integrate with Government computer systems, provide in-transit visibility of customer orders and supply information on all orders processed under the contract..

Question 8:  What is RFID?
Answer:	Please refer to the attached link for more information on Radio Frequency Identification Devise (RFID):  www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid
	
QUESTIONS PRESENTED & SUBMITTED ON INDEX CARDS:

Question 9:  Are warehouses required overseas?
Answer:	No, warehouses are not necessarily required overseas.  Positioning of material and/or warehouse location(s) are a Vendor’s business decision.  However, deliveries are required to be made within contractual requirements.

Question 10:  How many vendors is DSCP looking for to handle the Worldwide Support?
Answer:	The number of potential Vendors is unknown at this time.

Question 11:   Has DSCP considered looking into Transportation Contracts?
Answer:	No, DSCP has not considered utilizing any transportation contracts.  Defense Transportation Command handles Government transportation currently.

Question 12:  Why is DSCP targeting the SOW (Statement of Work) approach?  Wouldn’t a SOO approach provide more insight to the best practices of the Industry?
Answer:	DSCP will take this approach into consideration
	
Question 13:   How often does DSCP have to use OCONUS inventories to support CONUS requirements?
Answer:	OCONUS inventories are never utilized to support CONUS requirements.

Question 14:  What is the anticipated contract length (base, options)?
Answer:	The contract length, including the base year(s) and option(s) is not yet determined.

Question 15:  Does the US Army Corps of Engineers order their wood product requirements through DSCP? 
Answer:	The US Army Corps of Engineers may procure their wood products through DSCP but there is no requirement for them to do so.

Question 16:  Will DSCP provide an “Industry Day” participation list to all participants?  Will the list of participants be posted on the web?
Answer:	Yes, a listing of the participants of the Industry Day will be included in the minutes of the event and will be published on FedBizOps.  

Question 17:   Are the same items currently stocked in both CONUS and OCONUS?
Answer:	No, the same items are not currently stocked at CONUS and OCONUS locations.  As indicated on Charts 5 and 6, DLA only stocks 24 items (Wedges, Plugs and Blocks) in CONUS depots and 31 high demand lumber and plywood items in OCONUS depots located in Europe and the Middle East.
  
Question 18:  What percentage of sales comes from stock on both CONUS and OCONUS?
Answer:	Stock CONUS sales account for approximately 2% of DSCP’s wood products sales and stock OCONUS sales account for approximately 20% of DSCP’s wood product sales.

Question 19:   Are storage locations all Government owned and operated?  Will the contractor run the storage locations?
Answer:	Current storage locations Outside the Continental United States are owned and operated by the Government.  Currently there is one location within the United States where a customer provided warehouse space for Vendor Managed Inventory.  DSCP does not anticipate that contractors will run any current Government storage locations under this initiative.

Question 20:  What are the current inventory levels in terms of days of stock?
Answer:	Current inventory levels for OCONUS lumber and plywood are based on individual item demand combined with available warehouse capabilities.  Stock levels are not developed in terms of “number of days” of stock or set usage levels.  
	Inventory levels for the plugs, wedges and blocks that are stocked in the United States are based on a combination of demand and procurement lead times.  
	
Question 21:  What is the current fill rate for stock issue?
Answer:	Stock levels are set at an agreed upon level worked out between DSCP and DDC.  We are unable to stock at any depot what would be required for 100% support.  We normally only fill high priority, small quantity documents from Stock on Hand, and initiate a direct vendor delivery procurement for the balance.
 
Question 22:  Do inventory levels include any war reserve requirements?
Answer:	No, inventory levels do not include any war reserve material.

Question 23:  What do you see as a “typical” surge requirement as compared to peacetime demand?
Answer:	Surge requirements for each item required under any acquisition will be provided in the solicitation.  Each National Stock Number will have a separate surge quantity if applicable.  For the purposes of this Industry Day, vendors are advised that “a “typical” surge requirement can be described as being 10 times our customer’s peacetime demand level.

Question 24:  Do current supplier contracts include a “surge” requirement?
Answer:	All current Prime Vendor contracts include surge requirements.  

Question 25:  Will the RFP include a DLA Small Business requirement?  Minimum Percentage?
Answer:	The decision on whether any proposed acquisition will be set aside for small business or issued on an unrestricted basis has not been determined.  At this time, there are no minimum small business percentages that will apply.
  	
Question 26:   Who pays for and arranges for OCONUS transportation – DTS?
Answer:	OCONUS transportation through Defense Transportation System (DTS) is coordinated/arranged by the contractor and ultimately paid for by the Government activity identified on the order.
	
Question 27:  For proposal purposes, can the same supplier be teamed with more than one integrator?
Answer:	Yes.

Question 28:  What percentage of orders are routine? Urgent? 
Answer:	Approximately 20 - 30% of CONUS and 90% of OCONUS orders are considered urgent.  The balance of orders are routine.  	

Question 29:  Will there be a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification requirement?  Will there be any other green building product requirements?
Answer:	The Government follows ALSC (American Lumber Standard Committee) standards.  ALSC is looking at this for the future but for now there will not be any FSC or green building product requirement..

Question 30:   What are “traditional” payment terms?  Are discounts (1% 10 days or other) encouraged?
Answer:	Traditional payment terms refer to a percentage discount offered by the contractor to the Government if the Government pays the invoice within a specified period of time.  Yes; these types of discounts are encouraged.

Question 31:  120 days for implementation of the contract seems short, would 180 to 270 implementation period be considered?
Answer:	120 days for implementation was not fixed; the Government may consider a longer implementation period, if necessary.

Question 32:  Why is the Government allowing phone / fax / e-mail orders?
Answer:	This commodity does not lend itself to only electronic requests due to the mobility of the customers.

Question 33:  Please explain in more detail both the Buy American and Trade Agreement Acts?
Answer:	“ The Trade Agreements Act applies to the procurement of lumber.  Accordingly, all supplies must come from a US domestic, qualifying or designated country supplier unless one of the exceptions applies.  DFARs Part 225 explains both Buy American and Trade Agreements.  Trade Agreements countries are listed in DFARs clause 252.225-7021 Trade Agreements. 

Question 34:  Does the Government have goals in this (the BAA/TA) process?
Answer:	The Government does not possess any goals in this procurement.  The Government is governed by both FAR and DFAR part 25 and must procure any wood products in accordance with both the FAR and DFAR regulations.

Question 35:  Please provide an idea of who the users and/or customers are?
Answer:	A list of current customers both CONUS and OCONUS will be made available at the time any RFP is released.

Question 36:  Are there any security issues in collaboration with the customers for demand quantities?
Answer:	Security issues would apply if a contractor were to travel into a “hot” zone.  DSCP does not anticipate this as a requirement under any wood products contract.  Some security regarding the safeguarding a customers ordering data is expected.

Question 37:  How many contracts are currently in place for the CONUS and OCONUS?
Answer:	DSCP is currently utilizing 7 prime vendor contracts to support our customer’s demands both within CONUS and OCONUS.  Currently there are no long term contracts in place for supporting Wood Products demand in Europe or the Middle East.

Question 38:  Please provide an estimated timeline for a draft RFP and corresponding due date as well as the anticipated award date and corresponding first order delivery date?
Answer:	The Government is currently conducting Market Research for the wood products procurement.  A Business Case Analysis would follow the completion of the Market Research.  The Government’s anticipates a solicitation to following in 6 -9 months with an estimated award date in 12 – 15 months.  The first order’s delivery date would occur after the implementation period.

Question 39:  What is the proposal timeline going forward?  For example, published
solicitation, Quote submittal and contract award?
Answer:	Same as above.

Question 40:  Will the customer demand history (historical data) be provided pre-award by DODAAC?  
Answer:	Providing historical demand date is possible; however, if the Government chooses to provide such data, a signed disclosure statement might be required by the Vendor.
	
Question 41:  Can the utilized purchasing vehicle for the Lumber commodity be a cost plus contract?  
Answer:	A cost plus contract is not a viable option for the procurement of wood products.

Question 42:  Will there be additional EPA indexes for distribution and transportation?
Answer:	As the pricing structure of any resulting RFP has not been finalized, it would be premature to assume there will be a separate transportation and distribution element to the pricing structure.

Question 43:  Will separate CLINS be issued to provide pricing for CONUS and OCONUS?
Answer:	It is anticipated that separate pricing will be requested for CONUS & OCONUS. 

Question 44:  Will the “integrator” have control over the awarding of business to mills and/or suppliers based on the mills and/or providers performance or will that be contractually set at the time of award?	
Answer:	The Government does not dictate who the Integrator utilizes to fulfill the contract requirements However, contractors must supply material that is in accordance with American Lumber Standards Committee standards and that is in compliance with the Trade Agreements provisions of the acquisition.

Question 45:   Potential economies of scale evaporate when multiple awards are issued.  With that statement in mind, how many awards is DLA currently thinking of issuing and will there be separate awards by region?
Answer:	The number of potential awards and any possible separations based on regions are both unknown at this time.

Question 46:   Will DSCP publish all the questions and answers from the Industry Day?  For example, e-mail to the respective companies POC’s.
Answer:	Yes, all questions and corresponding answers will be posted on FedBizOps.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has developed and patented a device and method for welding and is seeking partnerships with firms interested in commercializing this method and device: US 6300591: Method for Laser Welding a Fin and Tube.

A method of laser welding a planar metal surface to a cylindrical metal surface is provided, first placing a planar metal surface into approximate contact with a cylindrical metal surface to form a juncture area to be welded, the planar metal surface and cylindrical metal surface thereby forming an acute angle of contact. A laser beam, produced, for example, by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser, is focused through the acute angle of contact at the juncture area to be welded, with the laser beam heating the juncture area to a welding temperature to cause welding to occur between the planar metal surface and the cylindrical metal surface. Both the planar metal surface and cylindrical metal surface are made from a reflective metal, including copper, copper alloys, stainless steel alloys, aluminum, and aluminum alloys. 

The laser welding technique is used to join thin copper or aluminum plates to copper or aluminum tubes. The laser beam provides a concentrated heat source, allowing for narrow, deep welds and high welding rates. The process makes high volume applications possible with consistent and reliable welding quality ensuring a proper bond between metal plate and tube.Partnerships will take the form of commercial licenses. Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable consideration. Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<p>Installation Instructions for IP500 Beam Barriers</p>
<p>DELTA MODEL IP500 (H) CRASH BEAM<br />INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />General<br />The objective of the Delta Model IP500 (H) installation is to accurately align and position the two pods relative to each other. Each pod consists of two modules: a larger module that provides most of the weight, and a smaller module that serves as an anchor for the chain crash tube. The pods should be oriented so that the hinge side is on the side of the roadway required by the installation (the larger weight pods can be towards or away from the threat vehicle). The center distance between the pods is determined by the order data. So there are no mistakes, the materials should be laid out and examined; in particular, the crash beam steel chain assembly should be measured to confirm its free length. The crash beam assembly is shipped with a heavy, special processed steel chain inside the crash beam with the latch end pin installed. The chain has yellow two-piece coupling links at both ends. With the crash beam assembly laid out on a horizontal surface, measure the distance between the outside of the latch pin and the corresponding location on the yellow coupling at the other end of the chain. This dimension less 43.5 inch [110, 5 cm] should be at least 1.0 inch [2, 5 cm] greater than the specified clear opening.</p>
<p>If on first examination the chain appears to be shorter than specified, the chain should be inspected to see that it has not been twisted or tangled within the crash beam assembly. A twisted chain that appears to be short can most often be corrected by turning the free end of the chain while still in the crash beam assembly. If this doesn't work the chain should be removed from the crash beam assembly and checked while laying straight, flat and untwisted on a horizontal surface.</p>
<p>After the pods are set in place and the concrete is allowed to harden, the Beam Barrier itself is assembled on the posts.</p>
<p>Referenced Dimensions<br />The distance from the inside of one pod to the inside of the other is defined as the clear opening length, and the barricade is purchased on that basis. The clear opening is the largest width that can pass between the pods without touching them. The clear opening is typically about 12 inches [30, 5 cm] greater than the width of the roadway. The center to center distance of the support post centers is 36.69 inches [93, 2 cm] longer than the clear opening. For example, if a 144 inch [3, 66 m] Barrier was purchased, the center to center distance of the support posts will be 180.69 inches [4, 59 m].</p>
<p>The center of the beam's height above the roadway is 33.25 inches [84, 46 cm] though the weight of the beam and the chain will cause it to sag somewhat. This standard height will effectively block the main body of most of the vehicle classes which may constitute a typical security threat.</p>
<p>Application Notes<br />When designing an IP500 (H) or its variations into a roadway site, it is helpful to consider the following points:<br />1) The gate is purchased on the basis of the clear opening, which is defined as the inside dimension measured between the pods.<br />2) Make sure that there are no obstructions that will interfere with the path of the Crash Beam's swing; for example, power lines, trees, overhanging buildings, etc. Additionally, the ground underneath the pods must be flat, level, and stable.<br />3) Delta Scientific Corporation suggests that a layout be done of the actual site to examine the fit of the Barrier. The thought put into the layout can mean the difference between a successful installation and a poorly performing Barrier.</p>
<p>Delta Scientific Corporation welcomes your questions in regard to application of our products and we will be pleased to review any site drawings or make recommendations on the appropriate length and position of the Crash Beam Barrier.</p>
<p>Site Preparation and Pour</p>
<p>1) The first step of the IP500 installation is to fill the pods with concrete and allow it to harden. The pour can be done directly at the site of the installation or the pods can be filled remotely, allowed to harden, and then brought to the job site. If the pour is done at the job site, skip to steps 2, 3 and 4 below to position the pods before pouring. Before pouring concrete make sure that there are conduits in place for all hydraulic and electrical lines needed to operate the barricade and any optional equipment. The pods have no bottom, so they must be placed on a flat, smooth, and hard surface before the pour is attempted. Flat concrete or smooth asphalt is acceptable. Otherwise, the bottom of the pods will not be flat, or the wet concrete may squeeze out the bottom. Place a plastic tarp under the pods or coat the ground with a concrete releasing agent before pouring concrete. This will prevent the pods from bonding with the surface they are poured on.</p>
<p>2) Outline with a chalk line the location of the pods. Make sure the clear opening distance is correct. Also confirm that chalk outlines are aligned correctly. The distance between the pods and the alignment can be adjusted somewhat but be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>3) Each module slots 3" x 8" [7, 62 cm x 20,32cm] slots which are designed to make the modules easy to move with a forklift. The anchor modules must be held from the side by a forklift and the weight modules must be held from the end. If the modules are set in place at the job site before the concrete is poured, it is better to use a concrete releasing agent instead of a plastic tarp to prevent bonding to the ground. If a tarp is used, it will cover the chalk lines, but the chalk should still be visible under a releasing agent. The anchor modules must be set in place first. Place the anchor modules in the chalk outlines made in step 2 above. The stop signs should be facing the protected side of the barricade. The hole in the hinge post ears should be offset away from the road. The claw shape of the latch post should be pointing away from the road. Once the anchor modules are in place, measure the clear opening to make sure it is correct. Also confirm that the modules are aligned with respect to each other.</p>
<p>4) After the anchor modules are set in place, the weight modules can be positioned. First, take the removable covers off the top of the weight modules. Near the end opposite the stop sign find the steel tubes. These tubes hold the drop pins that interlock the modules. Make sure the tubes are empty before moving the weight modules into place. Use a forklift to hold the module at the end with the stop sign. Line up the slots on the other end of the module with the interlock tabs of the anchor module. Gently move the weight module up against the anchor module, making sure that the interlock tabs go into the slots of the weight module. It is important to do this carefully to prevent moving the anchor module when positioning the weight module.</p>
<p>5) Remeasure the clear opening and check the alignment. If they are both still correct, place the drop pins in the tubes. The drop pins must reach the bottom of the tubes (the metal rings at the top of the pins should be just below the top of the tubes).</p>
<p>6) If pouring concrete at the job site, pour it and allow it to harden in the modules.</p>
<p>7) Replace the covers to each module.</p>
<p>8) Excavate and prepare suitable forms for the foundation base of the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>9) Trench for the hydraulic lines and any electrical conduits from the hydraulic power unit to the end support post assembly(s). Install the PVC ducting for the hydraulic hoses and all required electrical conduit from customer's control point(s) and the power disconnect to the Barrier.</p>
<p>10) Concrete notes and specifications (minimum requirements):</p>
<p>A) Contractor shall verify and be responsible for all dimensions and conditions at the job site.</p>
<p>B) Concrete shall be laboratory designed, machine mixed, producing 3,000 psi (20, 68 MPa) at 28 days.</p>
<p>C) Cement shall be tested Portland cement conforming to ASTM C150, Type I or II.</p>
<p>D) Aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Maximum size of aggregate shall be 1.5 inch (38 MM).</p>
<p>E) Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to final deposit by methods that will prevent separation or loss of materials. Troughs, buckets or the like may be used to convey concrete. In no case shall concrete be allowed to free drop more than 5 feet (1, 5 M). F) Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated by suitable means during placement and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into corners of forms.</p>
<p>G) Concrete shall be maintained above 50&ordm;F [10&ordm;C] and in a moist condition for at least 7 days after placement. Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating concrete materials and protecting concrete during freezing or near freezing weather.</p>
<p>H) Conduits and pipes of aluminum shall not be embedded in concrete unless<br />effectively coated or covered to prevent aluminum/concrete reaction or electrolytic action between aluminum and steel.</p>
<p>I) Contractor shall be responsible for the protection of all adjacent areas against<br />damage and shall repair or patch all damaged areas to match existing<br />improvements.</p>
<p>J) Contractor shall keep the construction area clean at all times and at completion of work remove all surplus materials, equipment and debris and leave the premises in a clean condition acceptable to the owner or owner's representative.</p>
<p>Crash Beam Assembly</p>
<p><br />Component List</p>
<p>Hinge End Module Assembly w/Hinge End Top Plate and Hydraulic Cylinder<br />Latch End Module Assembly<br />Two Weight Modules<br />Drop Pins to Connect Modules<br />Yoke Assembly w/Bearing (Pillow) Blocks<br />Crash Tube Clamp<br />Barrier Crash Tube with PVC liner w/Crash Beam Chain Assembly<br />Limit Switch (es) (optional)<br />Hydraulic Power Unit<br />Hydraulic Interconnect Hoses<br />Hydraulic Fittings (as required)<br />Miscellaneous Mounting Hardware<br />Miscellaneous Purchased Options</p>
<p>The assembly can be done most conveniently by two persons and a small fork lift or other lifting device.</p>
<p>Note: If mechanized lifting equipment is not available, adequate personnel for handling are necessary as the crash beam assembly weighs up to 350 pounds [160 kg] (depending on length).</p>
<p>Assembly Sequence</p>
<p>1) Allow the concrete to harden as specified.</p>
<p>2) If necessary, mount the hinged end top plate on the hinged end post assembly using the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers (leave loose).</p>
<p>3) Remove the hinge module hydraulic cylinder access cover and set aside.</p>
<p>4) If necessary, mount the lower end of the hydraulic cylinder using the clevis attachment point in the cylinder cabinet. Lock the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>5) If necessary, set bearing blocks on the yoke pivot shafts.</p>
<p>6) Set the yoke assembly (with bearing blocks attached) on the hinged end top plate. Loosely fasten the bearing block bolts (1/2"-13 x 1.5" long).</p>
<p>7) Remove the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers from the hinge end top plate and install the yoke safety retainer brackets. Re-install the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers (leave loose).</p>
<p>8) Place the tube locking collar around the crash beam with the positioning tab facing the<br />hinge end. Do not tighten the collar bolts until the tube is positioned in the yoke.</p>
<p>9) Lift the crash beam tube assembly containing the chain and latch pin and slide it into the yoke. It is necessary to start the loose end of the chain into the yoke.</p>
<p>10) If the hinge pin is not already installed, it should be installed now. Loosen one of the yoke bearing blocks and raise one side of the yoke to have clearance while installing the<br />hardened anchor pin. Insert the hardened 2 inch [5, 08 cm] diameter pin through the two<br />anchor ears and secure in place with roll pins. Lower the yoke and tighten the bearing block bolts. Connect the last link of the chain to the hinge pin with the second yellow two piece coupling. Unscrew the set screw in the collar at the center of the coupling and<br />remove the shaft. Place half the coupling around the hinge pin and the other half around<br />the last link of the chain. Reinsert the shaft through both halves of the coupling and the<br />collar. Tighten the set screw in the collar.</p>
<p>11) Check the position of the center of the bearing blocks relative to the center of the hinge pin. The hinge pin should be about 5/8 inch [1, 59 cm] further back (away from the road) than the bearing block center. The bearing blocks have slots that allow for some<br />adjustment. If necessary, loosen the bearing block bolts, move the bearing block, and<br />retighten the bolts.</p>
<p>12) With the crash beam in the horizontal position push the chain into the tube at the yoke end, so that a minimum of chain is exposed. Next insert the 3/4 inch [1, 9 cm] round cross pin through the hangers on the yoke and through the closest chain link. Tighten the set screws in the hanger. This is to minimize the amount of free chain exposed beyond the end of the tube.</p>
<p>13) Attach the upper end of the hydraulic cylinder to the mounting clevis on the bottom side of the yoke. Secure the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>14) With the Crash Beam in the full down position, check the side clearance between the<br />latching pin mounting box and the latching end posts. The box should be centered.<br />Note: If the box is not centered, with the four nuts securing the hinged end top plate<br />loose, swing the beam until it is centered on the latching post - then tighten the four<br />nuts.</p>
<p>15) With the crash beam in the full down position, check the clearance between the hardened latching pin and the latch posts. The clearance should be approximately 1/2 inch [12 mm]. This should be confirmed by raising and lowering the Crash Beam and insuring there is no interference in any direction.<br />If there is interference, the crash tube can be moved in or out or turned as required. Once the proper clearance is established the locking collar on the tube can be nested into the notch in the yoke and firmly tightened.</p>
<p>16) Grease the bearing blocks, actuator clevises and the chain at the points where the chain exits the crash beam. Use Shell Oil Company "Dolium R", Chevron "SRI No. 2" or Texaco Inc. "Premium RB" or similar.</p>
<p>17) Set the hydraulic power unit on the foundation, locate and drill for the anchor bolts. Caulk the base of the power unit enclosure to the foundation using a suitable RTV compound. Tighten foundation bolts.</p>
<p>18) Pull the hydraulic hoses from the hydraulic power unit to the hydraulic cylinder on the hinge post.</p>
<p>19) Pull any wires from the hydraulic power unit to the end support posts as required. Pull power and control wires to the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>20) Replace the hinge end support hydraulic cylinder access cover.</p>
<p>21) Touch up paint if required. Stripe the beam with the reflective tape if desired. Apply a thin film of anti-seize lubricant (compound) to any non painted or non plated carbon steel<br />surfaces (such as bearing blocks and exposed threads of fasteners).</p>
<p>Operation Notes</p>
<p>1) This barrier system is equipped with a descent control valve which is located on the lower fitting of the hydraulic cylinder. It will prevent the rapid descent of the crash beam in the event the hydraulic pressure line is ruptured or sabotaged. It has been factory set and sealed and should not be tampered with, nor should anyone attempt to adjust it. In the event of a problem contact the factory immediately for a calibrated replacement.</p>

Statement of Work
National Surface Water Chemistry Protocols for Air Pollution Sensitive Waters
30 June 2008

a.	Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services to accomplish the objectives and requirements contained in this purchase order to develop integrated protocols providing standard, efficient, and cost-effective methodologies for field sampling water sources and performing lab analyses.

b.	Background: 
1.  The Forest Service Air Resource Management program has a 25+ year history of the monitoring surface water chemistry of our highest and often most pristine lakes and streams. These inventory and monitoring programs are typically designed to identify sensitive water bodies, to determine status and to track trends of waters sensitive to atmospheric deposition.  Data from these programs are used not only to aid the Forest Service in land management, but are used in State planning processes, in industry pollution permitting and to provide the States, EPA, other Federal agencies invaluable information in their decision-making processes.  The data from these programs must be of the highest quality possible to withstand scientific and legal scrutiny.  Though most of these data have been collected under an established protocol, the Air program believes that it is to the Forest Service’s benefit to have standard field, lab, quality assurance/quality control, and data analysis protocols for the sensitive surface water chemistry sampling.

2.  Background materials from which the protocols will be developed include “Air Quality Related Values and Development of Associated Protocols for Evaluation of the Effects of Atmospheric Deposition on Aquatic and Terrestrial Resources on Forest Service Lands (Sullivan and Herlihy, 2007)”1 and “Field Guide for Surface Water Sample and Data Collection (Turk, 2001)”2 as background material for developing field protocols.  Other sources will include the Forest Service Aquatic Ecological Unit Inventory protocols, EPA standard and USGS protocols.  Existing lab protocols and methodologies in use at the Air Resource Management Laboratory should be evaluated and incorporated as appropriate.

c.	Project Deliverables: Specific tasks include:

1.   Draft protocol development:  Develop integrated protocols providing standard, efficient, and cost-effective methodologies for field sampling, and lab analyses.  These protocols must be in a clear, concise, well written document at a quality level suitable for publishing as a Forest Service General Technical Report or Technical Guide and, if appropriate, incorporated as official direction in a Forest Service Handbook.  Field methods must account for difficulties of sampling in remote areas where sample processing and shipping may not be available for several days.  The protocol must include detailed pre-trip preparation, supporting field measurements such as flow estimation, water temperature, and air temperature, actual sample collection for streams, lake shores and in-lake sampling at various depths, sample handling and chain of custody tracking.  Incorporate indicators recommended in Sullivan and Herlihy’s 2007 report. 1 The draft should be submitted to the COR for review within 90 days of contract date.  The Forest Service will have 45 days to review and provide comments to the contractor for revisions or additions.

2.  QA/QC procedures and data processing and analysis protocols:  Develop draft a QA/QC procedures integrated with field protocols, as well as data processing and analysis procedures to prepare data for upload into NRIS Air.  These protocols will include recommendations for handling missing data points, constituents below lab detection limits, outliers, and seasonality.  Trend analysis and guidelines for evaluating significance, as well as recommendations and examples for simple, clear presentation of results for decision makers should be included.  These protocols should be submitted to the COR for review by Forest Service within 150 days of contract award. The Forest Service will have 45 days to review and provide comments to the contractor for revisions or additions.

3.  Field and chain of custody forms: Adapt existing field forms and chain-of-custody forms to facilitate compliance with new protocols and to aid in the entry of data into NRIS. 

4.  Training plan:  Develop training plan and materials for field personnel  incorporating A/V materials currently under development with the Forest Service’s Missoula Technology Development Center. 

5.  Transition plan:  Develop plan to assist regions in the transition from current business rules and protocols to the new agency protocols.

6. Testing:  Test training materials, data collection methods, lab analysis protocols, and QA/QC procedures with Forest Service air program personnel during field season – generally April through July. 

7.  Final delivery of products:  Finalize all products after thorough testing and review of products by the Forest Service. Conduct functional assistance trips to help ensure appropriate implementation.


d.	Period of Performance: One year from date of award.

e.	Assumptions and Constraints: The contractor selected for award of this purchase order must have the following skills and/or knowledge:

	1. Strong Technical Writing Skills in Drafting Protocols
	2. Expert knowledge of Forest Service Air Resource Management Field Programs
	3. Experience and Expert Knowledge in Field Sampling and Data Analysis from 	Monitoring Programs.

The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
Commandant (CG-9131)

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p>1) 1.1 Parts to Repair back flow Devices. Cost not to exceed of $4,000.00 is the total materials for the entire project? If more material costs are needed to complete additional repairs, I am to assume that this work will not be completed over $4,000.00? Is there a percentage for mark up allowed on materials?</p>
<p>
<p>1a) Cost not to exceed of $4,000.00 is the total amount for materials for the entire project? YES</p>
<p>1b) If more material costs are needed to complete additional repairs, I am to assume that this work will not be completed over $4,000.00? My understanding is that once $4,000.00 is reached you would have to modify the contract.</p>
<p>1c) Is there a percentage for mark up allowed on materials? The funds available are $4,000.000, there is no percentage for markup.</p>
<p><br />2) 1.2 Repair Backflow Devices. Are Certified Payrolls needed? Davis Bacon Rates in effect? Is work "Time and Material" or "Hard Dollar Bids" based on findings from the initial inspection? Who determines what order the devices are to be repaired, assuming that of the 275, the $4000. material cost not to exceed for all repairs is insufficient.</p>
<p><br />2a) Are Certified Payrolls needed? No</p>

The support requirements are complex and demanding: schedules change daily; note takers must be provided for each meeting and immediately available in case of scheduling changes.  Because of the limited number of rooms available at the Waldorf-Astoria, EUR requires additional accommodations.  It is imperative that EUR staff are accommodated nearby, and that the hotel be able to provide, insofar as possible, flexibility in scheduling.<BR><BR>There is a continuing requirement for additional rooms beyond those immediately available on-site at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in order to adequately support the numerous meetings with European and Eurasian leaders to be held by the Secretary, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and other senior leadership.

QUESTION: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE WALDORF, SAY, WITHIN A MILE?Answer: The hotel should be  mile to the Waldorf-Astoria.
QUESTION:WHAT IS THE BILLING PROCESS?Answer: Invoicing instructions will be provided on the order. Generally, the hotel invoices Department of State and we pay within 30 days of receiving a proper invoice.
QUESTION: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HOTEL RATING OR PRICE RANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT? DO I CHECK DAYS INN (130.00) OR MARRIOTT MARQUIS?(550.00) Answer: We prefer hotels along the lines of Marriott Marquis.<BR><BR>

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the 
ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-4
                          CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Feb 2007)

Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the original and current response date of March 27, 2008 from this solicitation.
The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) requires a contractor to provide security services which will include 1) a professionally qualified and highly trained Special Police Officer (SPO) security force to provide a safe and secure work place for building occupants; 2) performing security force management and staffing; 3) security system equipment installation and maintenance; 4) administering the access control system and monitoring closed-circuit television and alarm activities; 5) detecting and deterring safety/security hazards, unauthorized, illegal, or potentially life-threatening activities; and 6) performing entrance receptionist services, parking administration, and other administrative security services as requested. The services under this contract shall be performed at the GAO Building, 441 G Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20548. In addition, GAO requires preventive maintenance on security system equipment at 820 1st Street N.E., Washington, DC. The government intends to award a fixed price type contract with the capability of ordering additional services to be performed under this contract as Temporary Additional Services (TAS). TAS will cover services performed after normal duty hours by technicians, administrative staff, parking administrator, and receptionists. It will also include additional services for security officers with less than 4 hours notice. TAS will be ordered pursuant to task orders issued by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and/or Technical Monitors based upon the hourly rates established in the contract. The base year period of performance shall be October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009 with four (4) option years covering Fiscal Years 2010 through 2013. The RFP will be issued on or about March 27, 2008.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: TITLE: F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program   This Notice of Contractual Action is a Pre-Solicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.201 and 5.203(a).  The 912th AESG - F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio plans to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8634-08-R-2650 for the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Obsolescence Program.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The anticipated RFP release date is March 14, 2008.  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program. The F-15 ESTS is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU). The system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill. The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY09 unless known obsolescence for a variety of component parts is not addressed.  The overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission Capable (NMC).  The program will accomplish this by replacing instruments contained within the station that are projected to be obsolete over the next several years.  The Air Force does not have program authority to replace or redesign the ESTS station.  The planned funding profile is as follows: FY09 - $13.11M, FY10 - $10.88M, FY11 - $15.86M.  Interested parties may view and/or download the full RFP by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The ESTS Bidders Library has been posted to the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) Website @https://www.fedteds.gov/ which provides a direct link to the RFP in FedBizOpps.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  Foreign participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level.  Address issues, concerns, and questions regarding this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Barry Foster; E-Mail barry.foster@wpafb.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  You may refer them to the Ombudsman if, after discussing them with the Contracting Officer, you feel that you are not effectively communicating with the government. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The ASC Ombudsman is Karen Emery, ASC/CS, 1865 4th Street, Bldg 14, Room 203, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (Phone: 937-255-6356; E- Mail karen.emery@wpafb.af.mil). Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  NOTE:  For all ESTS Modernization Program documents posted to date, please reference the PIXS location entitled ESTS Modernization Program.  All documents posted from this date forward, please reference Solicitation FA8634-08-R-2650.

<DESC>Introduction:  This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to act as a Medicare Payment Contractor as per Sec. 204 Medicare Medical Home Demonstration Project of H.R. 6111, Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006.  In addition, the Contractor will be responsible to verify beneficiary participant eligibility on a monthly basis and to provide customer service support and education to the Medical Home practices.     

The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) DOES NOT INTEND TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to conduct a Medical Home Demonstration as directed by Section 204 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA).  The Act calls for the project to provide targeted, accessible, continuous and coordinated family-centered care to high-need populations through a Medical Home Demonstration.  The Act also specifies that the demonstration will include Medicare beneficiaries who are deemed to be “high need” (that is, with multiple chronic or prolonged illnesses that require regular medical monitoring, advising or treatment.)  

Current statistics reveal that 86 percent of the over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries have one or more chronic conditions and 23 percent have five or more chronic conditions.  The current healthcare system is ill-equipped to handle a rapidly growing population of senior-aged baby boomers who will enjoy increased longevity, as well as increased chronicity.  It is estimated that, by the year 2015, 150 million Americans will have at least one chronic condition.  This wave of new chronically ill patients will further tax an already strained system of healthcare provision and payment.  At a time of increased demand on the system, there is strong evidence that there is a countervailing force at work on the delivery side.  Fewer newly educated physicians are entering primary care and seasoned physicians, feeling pressure to see more patients in less time, are retiring or moving to other fields.

In a 1992 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposed a definition and model for the Medical Home.  The AAP pioneered Medical Home in the early 1990’s with children and their families.  Since that time, their proposed model was generally accepted and implemented in pediatric practices throughout the nation.  The AAP believes that all children should have a Medical Home where care is accessible, family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and culturally effective.  There are few other practical examples of Medical Home care to observe and most involve medical care for children.  Examples of other Medical Home models include the American Academy of Family Practice’s (AAFP’s) “TransforMED”, and the Carolina ACCESS program which is a Medical Home for children under Medicaid managed care.

Other professional and specialty and subspecialty groups, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Practice (AAFP), the American Geriatrics Society, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and the American Heart Association have also called for changes in the provision and payment for chronic care.  Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home, (March, 2007) a position paper developed by the AAP, AAFP, American College of Physicians, and AOA, calls for a physician-directed medical practice with a personal physician providing continuous and comprehensive care across all elements of the complex health care system, utilizing a whole person orientation.

<DESC>Description<BR><BR>  This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey will be used to provide information on a flashlight evaluation effort under the Family of Flashlights (FoF) Program and introduce a revised Approved Family of Flashlight List (AFFL). The U.S. Army Product Manager, Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) is currently seeking qualified sources to provide  commercially available flashlights that satisfy the Buy American Act, Sec. 25.101, (a) (1), and (2), and to Sec. 25.103, and Berry Amendment. All submissions shall be provided by the vendor at no cost or obligation to the Government.Any information collected shall not be disclosed outside the Government. Test data for all submitted items will only be provided to the designated Vendor.  Interested parties should provide the following to the points of contact by 30 June 2008: product literature, product specification, and cost information (both GSA and MSRP prices). All products will be tested as submitted. All factors, to include cost, will be considered for inclusion on the AFFL using a systematic approach.  The AFFL will consist of three categories of flashlights: 1) Hands Free Helmet Light (HFHL), 2) Tactical Handheld Light (THL), and 3) Basic White Light (BWL) (non aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged). Limit 3 items for each category per company.  <BR><BR>Selection Process<BR><BR>The selection process for the AFFL will use a down-select process. This process will consist of 3 Phases: Phase I  Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing, Phase II  Technical Testing, and Phase III  User Evaluation. A scoring system will be used for Phase II and III. No external lab testing conducted outside of the Army for any phases of testing will be acceptable. All flashlights will be tested to the same procedures through Aberdeen Testing Center (ATC). A scoring conference will be held to determine which lights will be selected for the AFFL. Metrics will be weighted where Technical Testing is most important of all the areas and is significantly more important than the Physical Characteristics Testing. Physical Characteristics Testing is more important than the User Evaluation, which is more important than Cost. <BR><BR>Lights will be categorized according to capabilities. An integrated light that offers a basic white light, secondary color(s) and IR, does not constitutean addition to multiple categories. If it does not possess integrated color and IR, it will be tested under the BWL category. Should an item offer secondary color but no IR, it will be listed under BWL with an added capability. Only lights that offer integrated color and IR will be tested under the THL category. <BR><BR>Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing --Phase I<BR><BR>All candidates must meet all of the threshold performance criteria (Phase I) listed per category in its entirety in order to proceed to Phase II.<BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the HFHL are: 1) Must be compatible with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and side mountable with no helmet modification, 2) Must provide a minimum of 5 lumens for 24 hours, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 3in.x3in.x2in., 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Must weigh no more than 4 oz. with power source and mounting accessories, 7) Must be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the THL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 7) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the BWL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 6) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  Note: Non-aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged<BR><BR>Lumen Testing Procedure<BR><BR>Flashlights will be tested in a Labsphere FS2 Flashliht Spectral Flux Measurement System.  Flashlights will be tested in a field operational configuration by holding the flashlight in the four inch input port of the 20 inch sphere.  The area between the flashlight and the edge of the input port will be filled with a reducer to prevent ambient light from leaking in and flashlight light from leaking out.  A calibration will be performed for each flashlight type by turning the integrating sphere calibration light on while the flashlight is held in position and off.  This calibration will be used for all flashlights of this type that are measured in the FS2 Flashlight Spectral Measurement System.<BR><BR>A total of three flashlights per candidate model will be tested for lumens; all three flashlights must pass to advance to Phase II of the selection process. If any of the three flashlights fail the lumen test, the failing light(s) shall be allowed one retest with new batteries.  Failing a second time will be deemed a failure for that flashlight candidate model.<BR><BR>Phase II<BR><BR>Only candidates which have successfully satisfied Phase I requirements, will then advance to Phase II, Technical Testing. Phase II will consist of 5 environmental tests listed below.  5 new flashlights shall be subjected to each of the tests (25 flashlights total).  A minimum of 4 of the 5 flashlights must achieve the testing requirements for each environmental test for the flashlight system to receive a qualifying score.<BR><BR>1. Hot/Cold Operational Testing  MIL-STD-810F Test Method 501.4, Procedure II (Hot Env. 90 to120 deg F cyclic) and 502.4, Procedure II (Basic Cold -6 to -24 deg F) <BR>2.

All vendors must submit flashlights for AFFL certification and re-certification. Once the new list of AFFL is released, all candidates on the pre-existing AFFL will no longer be valid. <BR>Requests for extensions need to be submitted formally no later than 30 July 2008, and are considered on a case by case basis. <BR>Points of Contact<BR>Richie Frondoso, 703-704-2323, richie.frondoso1@conus.army.mil, fax (703) 704-3837 or Stella Lee, 410-436-6083, stella.y.lee@us.army.mil , fax 410-612-5497 <BR><BR>Questions and Answers<BR><BR>If a light providing different color (red, blue, yellow, green, etc.) options is  selected for the updated AFFL list, would all options be acceptable for addition to the list? <BR><BR>We would like to remind you that we will not be going out for procurement on any of the items selected for the AFFL. It is the Soldiers/Units choice of color options if they choose to purchase your item. Should a light qualify for the updated list, only red, blue, and/or IR will be annotated in the fact sheets. No more than 48 samples need to be submitted for one model if the item offers different color options.<BR><BR>How does the PMO determine what category the lights fall under for testing? Does the BWL category allow for integrated colors? <BR><BR>Lights will be categorized according to capabilities. An integrated light that offers a basic white light, secondary color(s) and IR, does not constitutean addition to multiple categories. If it does not possess integrated color and IR, it will be tested under the BWL category. Should an item offer secondary color but no IR, it will be listed under BWL with an added capability. Only lights that offer integrated color and IR will be tested under the THL category. <BR><BR>Would it be acceptable to submit accessories, not including the clip, that fall outside of the weight requirement?<BR><BR>Yes, other items can be packaged along with your product. If the light, along with the standard clip and battery, weighs less than 6oz for BWL/THL and less than 4 oz for HFHL.,then any other accessoriesare added capabilities. <BR><BR>Are you planning on creating an approved accessories list? <BR><BR>No plans have been made to establish an approved accessories list.<BR><BR>The solicitation states that for both the THL and BWL, the Highest power settings must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes. Does this require that the lights being evaluated must have more than one power setting (outside of the Highest Settings)?<BR><BR>No. The lights being evaluated do not require more than one power setting. Please disregard Highest power settings. Thisshould read, Mustprovide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes. The same applies to all categories. This has been updated.<BR><BR>Will items manufactured outside of the US territories be acceptable for testing?<BR><BR>Yes. These lights will be used for testing purposes only. If the samples pass all phases, the items should adhere to the Buy American Act and Barry Amendment 30 days prior to the release of the updated AFFL. Should these items continue to be manufactured outside of the US prior to AFFL release, those models will not be included in the AFFL.<BR><BR>Where is the lumens to be measured from? Is it directly at the physical end of the flashlight or 5 lumens at a specific distance away from the device? Conversely, in your Lumen Testing Procedure, while the test criteria is described quite well there is no distance established for measurement of lumens other than at the light source itself.<BR><BR>We will  use FS2 Flashlight Spectral Flux Measurement System from Lapsphere to measure the lumens. The reason for using an integrating sphere is to spatially integrate the light flux , which bounces the light around in an attempt to create uniform illumination on the interior surface of the sphere.  Then the illumination in lux (lumens/meter^2) of a representative area inside the sphere can be measured,  which should approximate the illumination throughout the interior of the sphere.  A calibration from a source with known luminous flux (lumens) can then be used to convert the illumination levels into output in lumens.  <BR>  <BR>When it comes to measurement distance, if the integrating sphere is used all of the geometry is dictated by the size of the integrating sphere, any baffling, and the location of the measurement area relative to the input port so we don't think that discussion of measurement distance is meaningful since it is all set.
