<CONTACT>Sandra K. Bucher, Contracting Officer, Phone (540) 542-2303, Fax (540) 542-2632, Email sandra.bucher@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0	Purpose:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is seeking information that will help the Agency define its future contracting approach for providing implementation support services for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning Program (IPAWS).   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.   Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission, other than acknowledgement of receipt if requested by the submitter.

2.0     Background: Executive Order (E.O.) 13407, Public Alert and Warning System, dated June 26, 2006, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that under all conditions the President of the United States can alert and warn the American people. FEMA is implementing projects to modernize and integrate the existing Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Alert and Warning System (NAWAS) programs to provide a national-level all-hazards warning system. Collectively these systems will constitute the Integrated Public Alert and Warning (IPAWS) Program.  IPAWS will utilize current national-level warning systems, support state, territory, tribal, and local warning needs, and integrate new technologies, standards, partnerships, and policies to improve public warning over all media, to all people, at all times, in all situations. Planned projects to be implemented over the next five years include investments in communications infrastructure across the United States. Efforts to support these activities may require collection and analysis of information on legacy alert and warning systems, engineering and specialized technical services, acquisition of hardware and software, site design and construction, installation, testing, integration, delivery and operations and maintenance support. FEMA will use the information received through this RFI to help define the appropriate contractual mechanism for acquisition of IPAWS implementation services.
3.0   Information Requested:  The following questions are intended to help structure a potential acquisition to provide a flexible, cost effective solution to IPAWS implementation. 
1.	FEMA is contemplating award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for these services.  A draft IPAWS Implementation Support Services Statement of Work (SOW) is provided as an attachment to the RFI for this proposed requirement.  Please submit your comments and recommendations to the proposed SOW.   
2.	A service type contract is anticipated and FEMA is interested in adapting a performance based scope for the contract.  What considerations are important when considering performance based contracts for this type of support services? Do you have any recommendations for specific performance incentives that have achieved the desired results on current or previous commercial or government contracts?  What specific progress reporting (such as ANSI 748) would you recommend?
3.	How should the purchase of any required hardware and software be accomplished (e.g., time and material type approach?)?
4.	What are some lessons learned FEMA should consider from other similar contracts with commercial or Government customers youve supported?   What features limited the effectiveness of these contracts? 
4.0     FEMA is also interested in assessing level of interest within the industry for this future support services acquisition.  Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability addressing their interest in serving as either a prime or subcontractor for this potential procurement. Therefore, in your response please provide the following information.

4.1	 Demonstrated experience in the following areas:
1.	Design, deployment, integration, test and delivery of emergency alert and warning or similar type systems.
2.	Design and construction of facilities to support operation of alert and warning or similar type systems. 
3.	Operational support of alert and warning or similar systems.
4.	Ability to carry out the services outlined in 1-3 above in a classified environment.
4.2	Certain aspects of the IPAWS are classified.  How is your company positioned to support classified work under this potential procurement, specifically, available personnel with U.S Secret or U.S Top Secret Clearances and an approved Facilities Security Clearance with a level up to Top Secret? Do you have staff to support this effort with appropriate clearances for access to White House facilities?
4.3 	Please provide information on your companys size and capacity including total annual revenues and number of direct employees.
5.0     All small businesses including Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this RFI. A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist FEMA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services.     In addition, this information will also be used to assist FEMA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages.

6.0     Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to the FEMA Contracting Officer, Sandra Bucher (see email address below).  No telephone questions will be accepted.     All questions will be answered via posting responses to the FEDBIZOPPS website.     

7.0     Please submit replies within 30 working days of publication of the RFI notice. Email responses are preferred and should be submitted to Sandra.bucher@dhs.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.   Please limit replies to 20 pages (including cover page), 8.5 x 11 inch, one-sided, with 1 inch margins and font no smaller than 12 point.  

8.0     Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on the documentation submitted.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified.

Thesefacilities will convert DOEs inventory of depleted uranium hexafluoride(DUF6)located at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and the Portsmouth GaseousDiffusion Plant to a more stable chemical form, primarily uranium oxide,acceptable for transportation, potential use/reuse, and/or disposition.Related objectives are to provide cylinder surveillance and maintenance(S&M)and disposal of the DOE inventory of DUF6, low-enrichment uraniumhexafluoride(LEUF6), natural assay UF6 (NUF6), and empty heel cylinders in a safe andenvironmentally acceptable manner as allowed by law and policy.  A singlesolicitation will be issued that will result in award of two contracts (oneforeach site) to a single offeror.  DOE currently has a contract with UraniumDisposition Services (UDS), LLC, for the design, construction and operationofthe two conversion facilities which expires February 2011.  The selectedcontractors  responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, thefollowing  requirements:  1) conduct an orderly transition from theincumbentcontractor to begin start-up activities for conversion plant operations atbothfacilities; 2) operate and maintain the conversion facilities, includingdisposition of uranium oxide and disposal of wastes;  3) providesurveillanceand maintenance of  DOEs inventory of cylinders; and 4) provide directdisposition of the DOE inventory of DUF6, LEUF6, NUF6, and empty heelcylinders.  The selected contractor will fully support NationalEnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) compliance activities, as well as prepare and implement awide variety of plans and reports which address: project management, NEPAdata,regulatory requirements, quality, product management, waste, radiationprotection, and other reports as required by the contract. The selectedcontractor will be required to utilize an Earned Value Management System(EVMS)that is certified to meet ANSI standard ANS/EIA-748-1998.  A draft RFPconsisting of Sections B (Services and Costs), C (the Statement of Work), L(Instructions) and M (Evaluation Factors) of the uniform contract formatwillbe issued for comment in first quarter 2009, followed by a presolicitationconference for potential offerors.  This will enable DOE to begininteractionswith potential interested offerors at an early date on the technicalaspects ofthe anticipated solicitation.  Details for the presolicitation conferencewillbe posted at a later date.  Following consideration of comments received ontheDraft RFP, the final solicitation will be issued with an anticipated offerduedate for offers 60 days after issuance.  The Government does not intend toacquire a commercial item or service using FAR Part 12. The NAICS Code andsizestandards are 561210 and $32.5M respectively. The contracts resulting fromthissolicitation each will be for five year term.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION(Brand Name Justification)In accordance with FAR 11.105 (a) (3), the following brand name justification is hereby provided for public dissemination. NOTE: This requirement will be competed among Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 8127 (d) under the NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), Group B. All prime vendors under Group B of the NASA SEWP contract will be given a fair opportunity to compete. 1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES: The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), VISN 5 Chief Information Office, has a requirement for a five-year lease to own contract vehicle for new Cisco LAN equipment at the VAMC in Martinsburg, WV and the VAMC in Washington, DC. The anticipated period of performance will be from January 30, 2009  December 29, 2013.2. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: FAR 6.302-1 (c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, Application for brand name descriptions.3. RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  This requirement is for specific brand name equipment.  Although this requirement is brand specific to Cisco, multiple distributors, including Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns, are available to quote on a competitive basis under the NASA SEWP multiple award contract vehicle. Brand Name Justification: Cisco is the standard across all of VA. Currently 100% of installed LAN equipment at the two (2) affected VAMCs in VISN 5 are of manufactured by CISCO.  Many of the switches and components comprising these LANS are reaching the end of their useful life.  Further, the growing number of high bandwidth network based applications, such as imaging and or PACs (picture archiving computer systems), VoIP (voice over internet protocol), VistA, VIP, Quadramed, etc. are placing greater emphasis on having an integrated, stable and smoothly functioning LAN.  The purpose of this procurement is to upgrade the 2 LANs to a standard configuration and capability detailed in the WAN\LAN Routing Standards developed by the OIS&T Region 4 WAN Internetworking Management Team.As VA works to streamline its support for its network configurations and better leverage its staff, there is an added advantage to managing the number of different configurations and variation in vendor equipment to a common set of equipment.   Existing VHA staff has experience troubleshooting the configuration and set up of Cisco routers and associated Cisco data network equipment, evaluating and assisting in the design of Cisco router networks and associated data network equipment, and performing problem resolution activities to maintain the integrity of the Cisco router data network.  Cisco equipment meets VHAs requirements for a secure network solution.  Cisco routers are the only routers that allow organizations to build a foundation for an intelligent, self-defending network, featuring best-in-class security services and routing technologies for the lowest total cost of ownership and highest return on investment.  Cisco Catalyst switches have built-in mechanisms to help make the network self-defending. They integrate security functions into the infrastructure to help control user access to the network and to various services, to help protect against network threats such as worms, viruses, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and to help ensure privacy in communications. Cisco Catalyst switches offer integrated security solutions for all networks without compromising performance. The following key points should also be considered in justifying procurement of Cisco solutions for this requirement:*	Using Network Admission Control (NAC) on Cisco Catalyst switches, the network will allow devices onto the network only if they meet certain criteria, such as having the latest version of virus software. NAC significantly limits the capability for viruses to enter the network. *	Access control lists (ACLs) assign users to designated network areas and block unauthorized access to all other applications and information. ACLs allow only designated users to access specified resources. *	Cisco Catalyst switches offer capabilities to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks. Features such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Snooping, Dynamic Address Resolution, and IP Source Guard all help prevent data and identity theft in the network. *	Identity Based Networking Services (IBNS) on Cisco Catalyst switches authenticate who can access the network and what network resources they can access. IBNS prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the network. Using IBNS, guests can be placed in a guest VLAN and provided access to the Internet. *	Cisco Catalyst switches offer numerous features to mitigate DoS attacks. These include Control Plane policing, Port Security, Scavenger Class QoS, and NetFlow anomaly detection, to name a few. *	Cisco delivers on the vision of integrated network security by offering a suite of advanced security modules including firewall, IPSec VPNs, SSL, and gigabit network analysis modules into the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches. By expanding on the Cisco SAFE Blueprint to include the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series, these capabilities enable more integrated, highly available, adaptive, and scalable security for network connectivity, services, and applications. *	Cisco Catalyst switches offer availability and resiliency by providing device-level, protocol-level, and network-level resiliency. Examples include:*	The modular Cisco Catalyst switches have redundant power supplies, redundant supervisors, fan trays, and clock modules that help protect against failure. Features such as NSF/SSO ensure sub second supervisor failover in an event of a supervisor failure.  Cisco IOS Software modularity, an industry first, takes high availability to the next level by allowing subsystem image upgrades without having to take the switch down. *	The fixed-configuration Cisco Catalyst switches support the optional Cisco Redundant Power System 675, which provides a 675-watt redundant AC power system backup source for one of six units, improving fault tolerance and network uptime. *	Features such as Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard prevent accidental topology loops from happening in the network, while Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) and Aggressive UDLD detect incorrect fiber-optic wiring or port faults. Network uptime is maximized when these features are enabled. *	Cisco Spanning Tree Protocol enhancements allow for maximum uptime, maximum available bandwidth, and greater levels of resiliency. Features such as Per VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST+) and Backbone Fast allow for load balancing of VLANs and rapid convergence of the network. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP), a unique Cisco feature, allows users to further maximize link and network resources by permitting load sharing of links and gateway resources in a Layer 2 environment. *	Routed Access in the wiring closet enables the network to respond to recovery times very quickly, often in less than 200 milliseconds (ms), and optimizes usage of existing network links and ports. *	Cisco IOS Software Modularity on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series boosts operational efficiency and minimizes downtime through evolutionary software infrastructure advancements. By enabling modular Cisco IOS subsystems to run as independent, self-healing processes, this innovation minimizes unplanned downtime through fault containment and stateful process restarts, simplifies software changes through subsystem In-Service Software Upgrades (ISSU), and enables process-level, automated policy control by integrating the Embedded Event Manager (EEM).

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure the brand name BD FACSAria II Cell Sorter with BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to procure a BD Biosciences FACSAria II Cell Sorter.  A new cell sorter is needed for the NCI Flow Core facility to fulfill its purpose of infectious cell sorting.  The BD FACS Aria II is the only known cell sorter on the market designed for infectious cell sorting which is able to meet all the salient characteristics described below.</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1.	Statute</p>
<p>Statute: 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) as set forth in FAR 13.106-(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Solicitation from a single source.</p>
<p>(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p>2.  Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>Salient characteristics which apply to the BD FACSAria II Cell Sorter:</p>
<p>&bull;	Incorporates a cuvette/flow cell that is gel coupled to the fluorescence objective lens;<br />&bull;	Uses a bead based automated drop delay calculation;<br />&bull;	Incorporates cytometer setup and tracking (CS&amp;T) software;<br />&bull;	Requires only on single 120 vac electrical connection to be completely operational;<br />&bull;	The ability to be upgraded to have a single cell-cloning unit that is temperature controlled;<br />&bull;	Supports online mixing of the samples during acquisition;<br />&bull;	Includes a self-contained Fluidic Cart;<br />&bull;	Supports nozzle-specific sort setup;<br />&bull;	Rinses the inside and outside of the sample line after each sample is run;<br />&bull;	Uses Octagon and Trigon technology for fluorescence detection</p>
<p>The cuvette based sorting flow cell in the BD FACSAria II minimizes dangerous aerosols when compared to the obsolete "jet-in-air" design of cell sorters from other manufacturers.  Since all of the existing instruments in the NCI Flow Core facility are from BD Biosciences, it is in the best interest of the researchers to use the same platform when sorting their samples.  The FACSAria II utilizes the same optical configuration as the BD LSRII and FACSCanto instruments currently in the facility.  This allows for the use of the same reagents for analysis and cell sorting, saving the cost of purchasing separate reagents for cell sorting.  BD Biosciences is the only known source which has local field service engineer support in place (6 engineers) to be able to provide rapid response to NIH/NCI laboratories. This is a critical reason for choosing BD Biosciences as instrument uptime and fast time to repair are critical.  The BD FACSAria II is the only known instrument that meets all of the above requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on December 19, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-90020-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) contract for a Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS).  The JCTD guidelines require integration of the JMEWS warhead into a Block IV Tomahawk missile and full systems test demonstration within 3 years.  The JMEWS will be designed to be integrated into a  Block IV Tomahawk because its extended operating range and in-flight command and control are critical to successfully mitigating the identified capability gap.  These features of the Block IV Tomahawk, along with its existing shipboard infrastructure, will ensure that integration and performance capability requirements can be achieved with the available resources and schedule.  Other platforms may be considered for future follow-on acquisitions after the JMEWS warhead design is optimized and successfully flight tested, subject to availability of funding.  
	NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems, P.O. Box 11337, Bldg 9022 M/S K1, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1998, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer of the Block IV Tomahawk Missile.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration technical data packages for the Block IV Tomahawk Missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapon System.  The JMEWS JCTD warhead will require extensive weapons systems integration with the Block IV Tomahawk Missile.  The integration will require specific engineering design data for the Block IV mechanical, electrical and functional interfaces.  The systems/subsystems interfaces will include weight and balance, guidance and control, executive computer control software, and satellite data terminal, among others.  Because detailed knowledge of the Block IV Tomahawk missile is required to perform the services and engineering support necessary, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing the integration of this requirement in the required timeframe without significant duplication of cost.  
	Raytheon will be the prime integrator of the warhead into the Block IV missile, however Raytheon will conduct a subcontractor competition for the warhead components.  Fuzes and technical support will be provided by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).    All interested sources should contact Raytheon at the above address, Attn: Christian Sprinkle.

<CONTACT>Sarah Allen 202 781-3685 Timothy Starker 202-781-3944
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure engineering, design, and analytical services for the development of a technical architecture for Next Generation Integrated Power Systems (NGIPS) from the four US shipyards that produce destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and submarines for the US Navy: Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (Gulf Coast and Newport News) and General Dynamics (Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works).  The addresses for the intended contractors are: Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Gulf Coast, 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39567; Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News, 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, VA 23607; General Dynamics Electric Boat, 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340-4989; and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, 700 Washington Street, Bath, ME 04530.  NGIPS is an enterprise approach to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship's power systems for Navy platforms that require power dense soluti! ons.  The objectives include refinement of the NGIPS Technology Development Roadmap; identification of requirements and technology gaps that would need to be filled to enable NGIPS application on destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and submarines; identification of modeling and design tool gaps to prioritize resources for the development of those tools; and identification of shipyard processes that would need to be adjusted to implement the NGIPS philosophy.

<DESC>R7 ? Groundwater Extraction Services; Solicitation #PR-R7-09-10017438; NAICS 562910 ? Remediation Services
The United States Environmental Protection Agency in Region 7 has a requirement for groundwater extraction at the Parkview Well OU1 site located in Grand Island, Hall County, Nebraska (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System ID # NEN000704456).  The city of Grand Island has an estimated population of 44,000 and lies north of the Platte River within the floodplain.  
The Parkview Well site consists of an aquifer contaminated with industrial chemicals, primarily chlorinated volatile organics.  Two groundwater contaminant plumes, the Northern Plume with a source area on the CNH America Facility and the Southern Plume with a source area at 3304 Engleman Road S., have been identified at the Parkview Well site located in the southwestern portion of Grand Island.  CNH America under the oversight of the NDEQ is addressing onsite soil and groundwater contamination of the Northern Plume.  Groundwater migrating east from the property boundary of the CNH facility does not exceed cleanup levels.  
The Parkview Well site has been separated into two Operable Units (OUs):  (1) OU 1 ? the interim remedial action to address groundwater contamination within and near the Parkview Subdivision and to protect private and municipal wells impacted or threatened by the groundwater contamination above cleanup levels; and (2) OU 2 ? the site-wide final remedial action including the Southern Plume source area and remaining groundwater contamination.  Contamination was discovered in 1999 when the Nebraska Department of Health sampled the Grand Island public water supply system during routine sampling. Contamination was present in Parkview Well #3, one of the town?s water supply wells.  The groundwater contamination extends approximately 3.5 miles from the southern plume source area into and beyond the Parkview subdivision. 
The first Record of Decision (ROD), an Interim ROD for OU 1, was signed in September 2006.  The selected remedy for OU 1 is groundwater plume control via extraction wells, ex situ treatment (carbon adsorption, air-stripping, or other presumptive remedy technology, etc.), discharge of treated water to the surface (storm sewers, sanitary sewers, etc) and for beneficial reuse, Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA), alternate water supplies, and groundwater-use controls as necessary to protect the private and municipal wells located within and near the Parkview Subdivision and to treat groundwater migrating toward the Parkview Subdivision.  
The cleanup levels  for OU 1 are the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for tetrachloroethene (PCE); 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE); and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA).  These are are 5, 7, and 200 micrograms per liter (?g/l), respectively.  An MCL had not been established for 1,1-Dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) and, therefore, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9 Preliminary Remediation Goal (PRG) for tap water of 810 ?g/l was used as the cleanup level. 
The OU 1 interim response action is consistent with and complementary to the OU 2 final action selected for this site. 
Objectives of this contract include construction of a treatment building, installation of extraction and monitoring wells, installation of underground piping, and final inspection.  Contractors will provide the necessary labor services related to equipment and materials management.

<a href="mailto:southerland.john@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to address the following needs regarding interpretation and analysis of passive sampling results: Compare passive PM10-2.5 concentrations with those determined by collocated FRM monitors and determinebias in the passive sampler measurements; Compare passive PM10-2.5 concentrations to satellite estimates based on aerosol optical depth (AOD); Compare results from passive samples analyzed by optical microscopy with those for collocated passive samples analyzed by SEM/EDS; Assess temporal variability of PM10-2.5 across sites; Assess spatial variability of PM10-2.5 within the Cleveland urban area, and Assess variability in PM10-2.5 chemical composition across sites.
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because Dr. Peters designed a passive sampling field study which served as a model for the recent Cleveland field study that will provide data for this requirement.  Furthermore, Dr. Peters is also responsible for developing a scientific approach preliminarily estimating the PM10-2.5 variability within the Cleveland urban area based on modeling the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from historic satellite data.  The same approach will be used for this requirement, as well, to provide a comparison between PM10-2.5 concentration surfaces determined by passive samplers and by AOD data.  
Dr. Peters expertise and working knowledge of previous  projects related to this requirement establishes him as the only person that can efficiently and promptly provide the required services.      NAICS Code 541690 applies with a small business size standard of $7M.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice

The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a solicitation for a new USAID Afghanistan project to increase access to potable water supply and sanitation services in poor communities, decrease the incidence of water-related diseases through household hygiene interventions, and improve the sustainable management of potable water quality and quantity in project-assisted communities.

The Sustainable Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene SWASH Project is a new USAID/Afghanistan project to improve the long-term technical, financial and environmental sustainability of potable water supply and sanitation services and improve hygiene behaviors for poor and vulnerable populations in Afghanistan.  USAID intends to implement this project through a Direct Contract, awarded through open competition (estimated approximately $60-75 Million over five years). Through this new project, USAID/Afghanistan hopes to increase access to potable water supply and sanitation services in poor communities, decrease the incidence of water-related diseases through household hygiene interventions, and improve the sustainable management of potable water quality and quantity in project-assisted communities.  The project seeks to support Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and other key stakeholders in providing sustainable improved potable water supply and sanitation services, hygiene education, and restoration and management of catchments in direct support of potable water supply in targeted rural and urban communities. The project will train project beneficiaries in water supply system maintenance and hygiene practices, and boost community awareness of the need for water conservation and watershed protection in relation to potable water supply.  Though the program will focus primarily on rural areas, activities for urban areas may also be considered.

All activities to be supported under this project must directly address the critical potable water supply, basic sanitation, and hygiene needs of the people of Afghanistan.  Implementation should be demand-driven and support requests from Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and other key stakeholders (GIRoA and others) to assess, and if appropriate, support the development and operation of improved potable water supply systems, sanitation facilities, hygiene promotion  (including point of use household water treatment), and the strengthening and capacity building of water user groups to manage services and participate in watershed management activities that directly contribute to addressing potable water supply quantity or quality problems faced by the community. In instances where PRTs request assistance and collaborate with the project, they will contribute by providing logistical support, security, and, where possible, local PRT funding to complement project funding through supporting additional efforts (e.g., check dams and reforestation) to improve the management/restoration of catchments to ensure a more sustainable and safe supply of drinking water for recipient communities.  Note: USAID funding under this contract will be limited to water supply systems, sanitation and hygiene education with other funding sources identified for catchment restoration efforts.

Community interventions should not only address immediate service delivery but consider longer-term, sustainable system management through sufficient attention to appropriate technology choice, capacity building for maintenance and repairs, a plan for financial sustainability and cost recovery for O&M, etc.  USAID/Afghanistan encourages Offerors to partner, where possible, with a variety of institutions in the public, private, and NGO sectors to achieve program objectives. Proposals may want to consider some level of small grants to qualified NGO or other organizations, and propose how such grants would be administered and how they would help meet project objectives.  

USAID will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued in the last week of February 2009.USAID especially encourages Afghan and/or regional contractors to consider this business opportunity. 

Award of the contract shall be made subject to the availability of funds. This letter in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contract shall be awarded subject to the availability of funds, FAR 52.23 2-18, because the contract shall not be fully funded at the time of award.

At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option  is exercised  prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12 month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period contract amount. At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $39,200.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).

The proposed acquisition will be for Repair of Control Display Unit, NSN 6605-01-348-6553, P/N 454640-01-02 or NSN 6605-01-200-4702, P/N 454640-01; or NSN 6605-01-053-5554, P/N 452090-02, and quantity is 15 each for the basic (first year) requirement with four (4) option years.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904. POC for this action is Theresa Alkeus, (252) 334-5174.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Disposable Vaginal Specula products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

 	1. Disposable Vaginal Specula, Graves, Large, Medium, Small, Illuminated
	2. Disposable Vaginal Specula, Large, Medium, Small
	3. Disposable Vaginal Specula Illumination System, On/Off Switch with 
       Transformer
	4. Replacement Bulbs, Exam Instrument Illuminator, 4.6v

Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.

2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disposable Vaginal Specula product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Disposable Vaginal Specula products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide a copy of their companys customer service policy and program 
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.
10.	Vendors must provide an option to obtain products that are latex-free or otherwise hypo-allergenic.  
      11.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy 
            proposed pricing, and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel 
           format.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations and will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

	1. Disposable Vaginal Specula, Graves, Large, Medium, Small, Illuminated
	2. Disposable Vaginal Specula, Large, Medium, Small
	3. Disposable Vaginal Specula Illumination System, On/Off Switch with 	 
                   Transformer							
	4. Replacement Bulbs, Exam Instrument Illuminator, 4.6v

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 



Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product can be assembled and or/disassembled quickly 
a. The ability to quickly assemble/disassemble the product enhances provider efficiency. 
b. Evaluation of this criterion will be accomplished by the clinician assembling and  
    disassembling the product
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. The Specula locks securely and resists collapsing during use
a. This criterion is critical to both patient safety and an efficient examination
b. This criteria will be evaluated during the patient (actual or simulated)
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The specula handle provides maneuverability 	
	a. This characteristic enables ease of manipulation of the specula during the patient 
                exam
	b. Evaluation will occur during the patient examination process (actual or simulated)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. The illuminator provides a bright, non-glaring light
	a. Provision of bright, non-glaring light facilitates viewing of tissue during the exam
	b. The quality of the light provided will be evaluated during the patient exam (actual or 
                simulated
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The sheath is easy to manipulate before/during/after exam
	a. Ease of sheath manipulation enhances provider efficiency
	b. The ease of sheath manipulation will be evaluated during the patient examination 
                process (actual or simulated)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
6. The construct of the product is sturdy and resists cracking/breaking
	a. This criterion is essential for patient safety and clinician efficacy
	b. These essential qualities will be assessed during the patient examination (actual or 
                simulated)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
7. The product is free of sharp edges, can be warmed, and doesnt pinch or bind vaginal tissue during use
	a. These characteristics contribute greatly to patient safety and comfort
	b. These characteristics will be evaluated during the patient examination process (actual 
                or simulated)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Knee products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

	1. Immobilizer Knee Universal Nylon Pile/Foam Laminate Hook and Loop Straps.
	2. Immobilizer Knee Compression Wrap Universal Nylon/Foam Laminate with Velcro 
   Straps.

	6. Support Knee Slip-on 1/8in Neoprene Open Patella Stabilized Patella. 
	7. 3 Panel Knee Splint Universal. 

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product is durable
a. A splint or brace needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with patient mobility
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. Product is lightweight
a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of 
time the device will need to be applied
b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item 
is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The product securement devices are easily adjustable and remain secure
	a. Allows proper fit to, and stability of, the injured or diseased body part
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure 
            device of the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. Product provides stability
	a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body 			part from further injury
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of 
            the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The product design provides a satisfactory level of patient comfort
	a. Comfort is a factor essential to the proper and consistent use of the product by the
             patient
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the design provides a 
            satisfactory level of patient comfort
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions, however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

6. Brace Ankle Stirrup Sport 9.0in Plastic Shell Foam Aircell Pad 1 Hook and Loop Strap. Small, Medium, and Large

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Ankle & Foot products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

	1. Brace Ankle Stirrup Regular 9.5in Plastic Shell Air Gel Pad 2 Hook and Loop Straps

2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Ankle & Foot product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Ankle & Foot products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide a copy of their companys customer service policy and program 
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.

            proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel 
           format

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

	1. Brace Ankle Stirrup Regular 9.5in Plastic Shell Air Gel Pad 2 Hook and Loop Straps
	2. Brace Walking Plastic Shell Low-Profile Ankle/Leg Fixed Rocker Sole with Foam 
   Wrap Hook and Loop Closures x 5. Small, Medium, and Large
	3. Brace Walking Plastic Shell Low-Profile Ankle/Leg Fixed Rocker Sole with Foam \
   Wrap Hook and Loop Closures x 3 with Circumferential Shell. Small, Medium, and

   Open Heel. Small, Medium, and Large
	6. Brace Ankle Stirrup Sport 9.0in Plastic Shell Foam Aircell Pad 1 Hook and Loop
   Strap. Small, Medium, and Large

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product is durable
a. A splint or brace needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with patient mobility
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. Product is lightweight
a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of 
time the device will need to be applied
b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item 
is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The product securement devices are easily adjustable and remain secure
	a. Allows proper fit to, and stability of, the injured or diseased body part
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure 
            device of the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. Product provides stability
	a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body 			part from further injury
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of 
            the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The product design provides a satisfactory level of patient comfort
	a. Comfort is a factor essential to the proper and consistent use of the product by the
             patient
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the design provides a 
            satisfactory level of patient comfort
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.                  The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

The approximate total annual purchase volume of all types of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Spine & Abdomen for the Mid-Atlantic region is $17,512.47 based upon the historical usage of standardized Orthopedic Soft Goods - Spine & Abdomen over a one year period.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your companys Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your companys responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  

Only Email responses will be accepted and must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.  If industry response is unsatisfactory, the TPRB reserves the right to proceed or delay the project.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Spine & Abdomen products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

	1. SUPPORTER, SUSPENSORY, WITH LEG STRAPS
	2. SUPPORT, GROIN, MALE WAIST

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

	1. SUPPORTER, SUSPENSORY, WITH LEG STRAPS
	2. SUPPORT, GROIN, MALE WAIST
	3. SUPPORT ABDOMINAL BINDER, UNIVERSAL, ELASTIC HOOK AND LOOP STRAPx3
	4. SUPPORT ABDOMINAL BINDER 3-PANEL 9in UNIV SHORT 45-62in ELASTIC HOOK AND 	LOOP CLOSURE

              w/SILICONE GRIPPER STRIP HOOK AND LOOP CLOSURE
 
1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product is durable
a. A splint or brace needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with patient mobility
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. Product is lightweight
a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of 
time the device will need to be applied
b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item 
is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The product securement devices are easily adjustable and remain secure
	a. Allows proper fit to, and stability of, the injured or diseased body part
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure 
            device of the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. Product provides stability
	a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body 			part from further injury
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of 
            the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The product design provides a satisfactory level of patient comfort
	a. Comfort is a factor essential to the proper and consistent use of the product by the
             patient
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the design provides a 
            satisfactory level of patient comfort
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions, however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Upper Extremity products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

1. BRACE ELBOW POST-OP UNIV ROM HINGE PADDED STRAPS
2. WRAP ELBOW UNIV FOAM NEOPRENE STRAP

14. SPLINT FINGER STRIP 18inL x 0.75inW ALUMINUM CLOSED CELL FOAM/WHITE

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product is durable
a. A splint or brace needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with patient mobility
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. Product is lightweight
a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of 
time the device will need to be applied
b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item 
is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The product securement devices are easily adjustable and remain secure
	a. Allows proper fit to, and stability of, the injured or diseased body part
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure 
            device of the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. Product provides stability
	a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body 			part from further injury
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of 
            the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The product design provides a satisfactory level of patient comfort
	a. Comfort is a factor essential to the proper and consistent use of the product by the
             patient
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the design provides a 
            satisfactory level of patient comfort
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

7. STRAP CLAVICLE TRIANGLE BACK 3-WAY ADJUST MED/TEEN FELT/WEB/STOCKINETTE STRAPS HOOP AND LOOP CLOSURE PADDED SHOULDER STRAPS/BACK. 

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Shoulder & Clavicle products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

	1. IMMOBILIZER SHOULDER ABDUCTION 15deg PILLOW PADDED SLING/THUMB LOOP 	PADDED SHOULDER/WAIST STRAP.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The product is durable
a. A splint or brace needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with patient mobility
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
2. Product is lightweight
a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of 
time the device will need to be applied
b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item 
is acceptable
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
3. The product securement devices are easily adjustable and remain secure
	a. Allows proper fit to, and stability of, the injured or diseased body part
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure 
            device of the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
4. Product provides stability
	a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body 			part from further injury
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of 
            the item is acceptable
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.
5. The product design provides a satisfactory level of patient comfort
	a. Comfort is a factor essential to the proper and consistent use of the product by the
             patient
	b. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the design provides a 
            satisfactory level of patient comfort
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions, however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

1.  This procurement will require the use of MILSTRIP ordering, Web-based ordering, Enhanced EDI Ordering and Hospital Ship Activation support of predetermined requirements through phone or fax ordering.  Prospective contractors will be required to provide all types of ordering to Navy customers.  Prospective contractors will be required to meet delivery timeframes outlined in this SOW for MILSTRIP, Web-based ordering and Enhanced EDI.  Delivery timeframes apply to CONUS and Navy activities in Hawaii.  
	
	a. Contractors will be required to receive orders via standard MILSTRIP requisitions from Navy ships while in port and underway.  Navy MILSTRIP orders will be converted to 850-4010 Purchase Order at DSCP and then transmitted electronically to the Contractor.  Delivery will be to ISSOT, Norfolk VA. 
	
	b. Contractors will also be required to receive orders via contractors Electronic Order Entry (EOE) system from all Navy Fleet activities.

	c. Contractors will also be required to receive orders via Enhanced MILSTRIP.  This will require the vendor to have both a Web and EDI account at its Regional Distribution Facility that accepts specific 850  3050 version, 855 and electronic 810.

2.  Contractors will be required to receive orders via standard EDI and Web from Navy ships while underway.  Deployed Navy ships will transmit electronically to the Contractor for delivery to Home Port regional location.

3.  Contractors will also be required to receive orders via contractors Electronic Order Entry (EOE) system/Web-based system and/or Enhanced EDI from all Navy Fleet activities. 

4.  The contract will initially cover approximately 7,000 individual items.  The Government estimates that 15,000 to 30,000 orders per year will be transmitted to the contractor (subject to change based upon changing world conditions).  The estimate number of orders placed per year is based on the combined ordering processes of Web and EDI.

5.  Contractors need not submit product pricing as product prices will be based on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) issued by DSCP-Medical.  However, the contractor shall establish a Regional DAPA for all non-DSCP DAPA database products, made available, based on usage level, by the contractor and required by one or more ordering facilities.  Pricing will be reviewed and approved by DSCP contracting officer. 

6.  Usage data will consist of a list of items actually purchased on an annual basis by the Fleet.  The list will consist of both Usage and Non-Usage items.  Usage items are those items that are in high demand and ordered on a consistent basis.  Non-Usage items are those items ordered on a less consistent basis.  DSCP and vendor will analyze DAPA items by quantity ordered and by region to determine historical usage upon which to base Usage/Non-Usage List. 

7.  For all orders, the contractor shall fill the entire order.  If the entire quantity is not available, the contractor shall fill the available quantity and backorder the remaining quantity for no more than 10 calendar days.  Orders for items that are unavailable shall be put on backorder.  For completely unfilled backordered items, if a manufacturers backorder is expected to exceed 30 days the order will always be killed.  The Contractor must clearly indicate to the ordering activity that the unfilled order is the result of a manufacturer backorder.  Also, if the item is discontinued or obsolete, the order shall be killed.  

8.  Prospective vendors are advised that Tailored Vendor Relationship (TVR) requirements will be included in this solicitation. TVR will require the vendor to produce an 855 order acknowledgement transaction upon receipt of order for all Web-based non-EDI orders. 

9.  Unless an exception is granted by the PV, each ordering facility must have a minimum of $10,000 in annual purchases to participate in the contract. The PV is required to meet the same standard of service for all participating facilities, regardless of ordering volume.  A PV can offer small facility support through a different Corporate division (such as a physician/clinic sales division), as long as all terms and conditions of the SOW are met, including the requirement that Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) customers can still receive the required electronic system ordering support.  If a small facility support corporate division is part of the PV award, the $10,000 annual purchase ordering facility minimum requirement is no longer applicable. 

10.  Line Fill Rate by Contract Delivery Date (CDD) Metric Performance Adjustment Provision

     The awardee under this solicitation will be expected to meet or exceed the Line Fill Rate by CDD metric provided as part of its technical evaluation proposal and which will be made a part of any resulting contract. This solicitation and any resulting contract incorporates a 3% downward distribution price adjustment in the event the vendor fails to meet the Line Fill Rate by CDD metric. Furthermore, a failure to maintain the contract Line Fill Rate by CDD metric may result in termination of the contract. 

     The Government will apply a monetary adjustment based on the vendors Line Fill Rate by CDD performance.  Performance will be assessed for each contract period and will be based on a minimum of 10 months of vendor performance data. In the event the vendor does not meet the Line Fill Rate, the 3% adjustment will be applied to the contract distribution price for the ensuing contract period for all core list items, as of date of assessment. The adjustment to each core list distribution price shall not exceed a 3% reduction for Line Fill Rate performance. The adjustment will become effective on the first day of ensuing contract period. The vendor will be responsible to invoice at the proper, applicable, distribution fee.  

     If the vendor fails to meet the Line Fill Rate by CDD, during the last contract period or when the Government does not exercise an option, the contractor shall be subject to a one-time recovery payment which would be owed to the Government based on the total distribution price amount in the last contract reporting period. The payment will be calculated by adding up the total distribution price for all orders issued during a 10 month period of the last period and shall be the same period as used to determine the Line Fill Rate performance. This total distribution price amount will be multiplied by the 3% and the resulting figure will be the amount owed by the vendor to the Government.

     The total number of orders for establishing the fill rate will be established using a statistical sampling of all orders.  Proof of delivery documentation will be requested for all such statistical samples. The Government will determine whether the vendor delivered the full required quantity of material on or before the contract delivery date for each order. The order date will be established by the date when a delivery order was funded and issued.  The Government shall adjust the customer required delivery date (RDD) to take into account any Government order processing time, if applicable. The Government may use customer receipt data, proof of delivery documentation or other Government systems to establish the customer receipt date.  

     The vendor shall maintain and provide supporting documentation, such as carrier proof of delivery, when requested by the Government. The Government shall ask for proof of delivery documentation, on a monthly basis, for specific orders using statistical sampling to identify the number of orders and specific order numbers.  Proof of delivery documentation shall at a minimum have the name and signature of the customer accepting the material, quantity being accepted, and date of material acceptance.  When the Government cannot ascertain delivery through its systems and/or the vendor cannot provide valid proof of delivery; that order shall be determined to have been late or not delivered at all.

     A monthly Line Fill Rate by CDD will be established by dividing the number of sampled orders that were not delivered in full and were late by the total number of orders reviewed. The resulting percentage will then be subtracted from 100%.

     The Government will establish the Annual Line Fill Rate by CDD by taking a weighted averaging of a minimum of 10 monthly Line Fill Rates.  This Annual Line Fill Rate by CDD percentage will then be used to determine if the downward adjustment applies.  Line Fill Rate by CDD will be rounded to the second decimal point. 

     Orders that will have a negative impact on the monthly and annual Line Fill Rate by CDD will be ones that were found to not have been delivered on time by the CDD, were not delivered at all or were not delivered in the full order quantity by the CDD.  

     Award will be based on overall Best Value to the Government 

     Anticipated solicitation issuance date is on or about early Spring 2009, and the estimated proposal due date will be on or about 45 days thereafter . The official Synopsis citing the solicitation number, and inviting Offerors to register electronically to receive a copy of the solicitation when it is issued is anticipated to be available on or about           .

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein.  

BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR LESS.


The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to conduct a study of brain-behavior function in typically developing children from 5 to 18 years of age.  It is expected that approximately 100-200 participants will be successfully scanned and developmentally assessed and that there will be a longitudinal component in the study design.  The result of the study will be a publicly available database that can be easily queried and to which additional studies can append relevant data.

The mission of the Child Development and Behavior Branch (CDBB), within the Center for Research for Mothers and Children (CRMC), NICHD, is to develop scientific initiatives relevant to the psychobiological, cognitive, language, and behavioral development of children, adolescents, and young adults.   One of the CDBB areas of emphasis is to support research in human brain development and the associated development of technology to facilitate neuroimaging of pediatric populations.  This announcement is a solicitation to develop a database of normative brain-behavior function in children from 5 to 18 years of age through the use of Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI.  This database will focus on a limited number of primary behavioral domains associated with major brain regions or pathways relevant to normal brain development in children.  The specific developmental domain(s) will be proposed by the Offerer.  The database will be made freely available to the public for research purposes.  A second, optional objective is to conduct basic perfusion studies in the child sample in order to establish the normal variation in brain perfusion among typically developing adolescents.  This objective requires the development of studies using arterial spin labeling (ASL) for whole brain with a subsample of the primary sample.  In addition, ASL is important for establishing the validity of BOLD fMRI data since such data is dependent upon brain perfusion.  Such studies will allow comparisons of data generated by the two complementary methods of BOLD and ASL.  The contractor will be required to subcontract to the NIH Biomedical Imaging Research Network (BIRN) in order to use the BIRN infrastructure, software development and data repository for maintaining all data associated with the project.  Information about the NIH BIRN is available at http://www.nbirn.net/index_ie6.shtm  .   

Background 
There are, at present, a large number of techniques that could be considered functional brain imaging. For the purpose of this initiative, functional neuroimaging will refer primarily to fMRI. As a neuroimaging technique, fMRI is particularly useful because it is noninvasive (no injections or inhalations needed) and does not require subjects to be exposed to ionizing radiation. Thus, subjects (including children) can be scanned repeatedly, facilitating longitudinal, developmental, and drug studies. The same subject can be scanned on different occasions, using many different tasks, which allows researchers to probe different brain structures and networks. 

In a relatively short time, adult fMRI research has grown rapidly and made important contributions in understanding cognition and neurobehavioral disorders. In contrast, the functional neuroimaging research involving children and adolescents is quite small and limited. In a recent review of PubMed articles published in the past five years, 210 functional neuroimaging articles involving children were identified. Of these articles, 92% involved adolescents 18 years or older and 98% involved sample sizes less than 15 per group. The control groups in these studies are often matched to the target group and therefore not a representative sample of typical development. These factors increase the likelihood of both type I and II errors and make it impossible to generalize findings. Larger-scale studies are needed in order to make more reliable interpretations of pediatric fMRI data. 

Pediatric functional neuroimaging research has several major needs.  One is to create a database of normal brain activation in a large sample of typically developing children and adolescents.  Such a database can be used to investigate normal brain-behavior development as well as provide comparison data for pediatric clinical populations.    As part of creating such a database, gold-standards for fMRI scanning protocols and new analytic methods need to be developed.  Another need is a standardized approach to investigating brain-behavior questions.  This could be best accomplished by concentrating on one or two developmental domains that could be used as a model for investigations in other developmental domains.  Examples of possible developmental domains include motor development, memory, perception, language, behavior regulation, attention/cognitive self-regulation, and  decision making.   A further need is brain perfusion studies to compile brain perfusion data by age, a major gap in the pediatric functional neuroimaging field.


To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate:

1.	A record of having access to and proper use of a state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging machine.  
2.	Proven capacity for successful functional neuroimaging of typically developing, non-sedated children from ages of infancy through 21 years of age.
3.	Professional personnel with proven experience in preparing unsedated children for successful functional neuroimaging sessions.   
4.	Technical expertise and experience in the development and use of software for analysis of neuroimaging data from pediatric populations.  
5.	Experience and clinical expertise sufficient to provide developmentally appropriate medical, cognitive, behavioral and other developmental assessments for a pediatric population. 
6.	Proven expertise and proficiency in establishing and monitoring on an on-going basis the standardized administration of medical, cognitive, behavioral and other developmental assessments required by this project. 
7.	Research experience and expertise sufficient to identify or develop neurocognitive tasks appropriate for functional neuroimaging of pediatric populations.
8.	The ability to provide medical supervision during neuroimaging of children and adequate medical review of neuroimaging data for any incidental findings.
9.	Technical expertise and capacity for establishing a data pipeline utilizing the BIRN infrastructure.
10.	Technical expertise and proficiency for developing efficient data quality control procedures for neuroimaging and other data required by this project.   
11.	Technical expertise and capacity for developing a user-friendly, queryable database compatible with BIRN infrastructure requirements.  
12.	Ability to provide NICHD with access to the queryable database through the BIRN infrastructure on an on-going basis as data are pipelined through the BIRN.  
13.	Ability to provide NICHD with a usable copy of the raw data and the database in the manner deemed most appropriate given the technology available at the end of the project.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Labor - OWCP UECMS Request for Information 
Office of Workers Compensation Programs 
Unified Energy Claims Management System
Request for Information 

I. Introduction 

The United States Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP) has a need to develop a new case management system for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP).  The new case management system, called the Unified Energy Case Management System (UECMS), will replace the current system, modernize the technical architecture, accommodate new business processes and rules, and improve claims processing efficiency.  In particular OWCP wishes to bring the technology base into conformance with DOL and Federal Enterprise Architecture standards.  

OWCP is seeking vendors to develop a case management system employing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and implementing a set of requirements expressed in approximately 250 use cases. DOL expects to release a solicitation to implement this system in calendar year 2009.

II. Background 

The current EEOICP case management system provides authorized program staff with case creation, case actions, tracking, querying, and report generating capabilities. This system maintains records of claims filed, the adjudicatory status of claims paid and denied, the amount of lump sum payments issued, and the eligibility status for covered medical conditions. Authorized staff can create, verify, certify, authorize, and transmit lump sum compensation payment transactions in the payment module of the EEOICP case management system to establish eligibility and pay benefits.  The systems query function provides authorized DEEOIC staff with ready access to claimant information. The report function in the EEOICP case management system generates case workload management and internal and external reports.  The system also creates payment eligibility files, which are transmitted using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) technology to OWCPs Central Bill Payment (CBP) contractor to facilitate medical bill processing services for OWCP.
  
The UECMS project was initiated to modernize the current case management system and to make the DEEOIC technology base compliant with Federal, DOL, ESA, and OWCP target enterprise architecture standards. After a thorough evaluation of technological, process, and contractual alternatives, a model-driven project development strategy was adopted that addressed these objectives.  OWCP has completed the overall design of UECMS based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) including use cases, hardware and software platforms, an implemented proof of concept, and the design of an OLTP database based on the initial requirements.
 
III. Scope 

Development, test and production environments have been established to support the UECMS project in alignment with DOL architecture and goals.  These environments include the following:

WebSphere Business Modeler 
WebSphere Integration Developer 
WebSphere Process Server 
WebSphere Business Monitor 
WebSphere Application Server 
Rational ClearCase 
Rational RequisitePro 
Rational ClearQuest 
Rational Test Manager 
Rational Software Architect 
Rational Application Developer
Rational Database Architect 
IBM DB2 Database Management System

The high-level technical requirements for UECMS are listed below:

	Implement a scalable enterprise architecture that can easily accommodate new functionality, significant increases in numbers of users, and significant increases in the number of claims processed
	Develop the system using a Service Oriented Architecture following Java/J2EE standards and using IBMs WebSphere products, including WebSphere Business Modeler Advanced, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Integration Developer, and the IBM Rational suite, including RequisitePro, ClearQuest. ClearCase, Software Architect, Application Developer, and Data Architect
	Develop the system as a browser based application designed to run on the DOL intranet
	Build a transactional application that is capable of processing tens of thousands of claims per year with the capability of accommodating significant volume increases
	Ensure the system meets Federal and DOL usability, security, reliability, performance, and supportability standards
	Build the system to support approximately 1,000 users located at the DOL National Office located in Washington, D.C. and at the DOL District Offices and Resource Centers located throughout the country.

<a href="mailto:antonio.stewart@amedd.army.mil">European Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>A.	General Information.<BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia. Standardization for this product line, Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body, represents new or first-time initiative for the Europe Region. This product line includes a full line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body in various sizes and descriptions, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria, below, Usage Items. <BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is September 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $450,842. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top ten high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Collar Cervical EMS Extrication Univ Adult Adj Plastic/Foam Trach Open Hook and Loop Closure w/Chin Rest	$24,407.95<BR>Collar Cervical EMS Extrication 16 Adj Settings Plastic/Foam Trach Open Hook and Loop Closure	$20,898.68<BR>Collar Cervical Foam Med Density Universal 4.75inH 22inL Contoured w/ Stockinette Cover Hook and Loop Closure	$18,949.32<BR>Sling Arm Triangle Bandage Child	$14,043.93<BR>Splint Finger Strip 18inL x 0.75inW Aluminum Closed Cell Foam/White	$12,452.87<BR>Collar Cervical Adult w/Extra Pads Tall	$10,026.85<BR>Sling Arm Hemiplegic Left Large Cotton Envelope 2-Padded Shldr Straps w/Thumb Loop Padded Back	$9,083.53<BR>Collar Cervical Philadelphia Med 4.25inH 13-16inL w/Chin Rest Trach Open Adjustable Strap	$8,174.66<BR>Collar Cervical Adult w/Extra Pads Regular	$8,108.67<BR>Immobilizer Shoulder Sling Large PE Synthetic Closed Elbow/Open Hand Padded Shoulder/Body Strap	$7,977.20<BR><BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address), and all answers to the technical/company criteria to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.   After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>	1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company 	criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.<BR>2. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Upper Body products for single use. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in for this report as items ordered by the Europe region within a twelve month period. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>	a. Wrist Supports: Sizes-XSmall, Small, Medium, Large, Xlarge, 				and Universal.<BR>	b. Cervical Collars: Sizes-Small, Medium, Large, Universal, Children 6-			12yr, and Pediatric 2-6yr.<BR>	c. Arm Slings: Sizes- XSmall, Child, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge, and 			Universal.<BR>	d. Finger/Thumb Splints: Sizes-Universal, Small, Medium, and Assorted.		e. Elbow Sleeves, Bands, and Braces: Sizes-Small, Medium, Large, 				XLarge, and Universal.<BR>	f. Shoulder Immobilizers: Sizes-XSmall, Small, Medium, Large, and 			Universal.<BR>	g. Acromioclavicular and Clavicle Straps: Sizes-Infant, Small, Medium, 			Large, and Universal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________. <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV Owens & Minor for distribution in the Europe Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. (Note a vendor that fails to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (FDA 510K, OSHA regulations, and CDC guidelines) used in manufacturing Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products with initial submittal. <BR>7.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ. Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide contact information (Name, phone number, and e-mail address) for a local vendor representative in the Europe Region in response to this RFQ.<BR>9.	Vendors must supply literature demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this in response to this RFQ.<BR>10.	Vendors must provide statement revealing all product line items containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendors must provide documentation for all possible educational tools and materials that are available for Orthopedic Soft Good - Upper Body products in response to this RFQ.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide documentation for 24/7 customer service and identify company resources for such support in response to this RFQ.<BR>13.	Vendors must provide documentation showing that their shoulder immobilizer has abduction capability in response to this RFQ.<BR>14.	Vendors must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices. Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities. The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria. Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>	1. Adjustable closure (proper fit). <BR>		a. Allows proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body part.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	2. Lightweight (patient comfort). <BR>		a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due 			to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	3. One-handed application and removal (self-application). <BR>		a. Due to the injury of the body part there is only the other extremity 				that is functional.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	4. Product has features to provide comfort to user (patient comfort). <BR>		a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to 				allow for patient comfort.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	5. Provides firm support (patient safety). <BR>		a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the 				body part from further injury.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	6. Allows (and does not impinge upon) range of motion (ROM) of the 					metacarpal phalangeal joints -MCPJs (finger joints) and the 				thumb (patient safety). <BR>		a. Some splints incorporate more than one joint above and/or below the 				injured body part. It is important that certain joints if they are 				not injured are allowed to move freely.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	7. Washable (patient hygiene, MTF cost savings). <BR>		a. Some splints have the capability to continue to provide support after 				washing.<BR>		b. Washing provides patient hygiene due to the length of time this 				particular splint needs to be applied.<BR>		c. Washing allows patient reuse of splint providing a cost savings to the 				MTF.<BR>		d. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	8. Secure Closure (patient safety). <BR>		a. Prevents accidental disconnects allowing stability and reduction of 				pain.	<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>	9. Air Permeable/Breathable (patient comfort). <BR>		a. Splints and/or braces may cause increased perspiration thus 					discomfort. It is important for a cervical collar to allow some air 				flow reducing the severity of this process.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF 				using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>10. Immobilization (patient safety). <BR>a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the 		body part from further injury.<BR>b. Each criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR><BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00 <BR><BR>Finger Splints-<BR>1.	Adjustable closure (proper fit).<BR>2.	Lightweight (patient comfort). <BR>3.	One-handed application and removal (self application). <BR>4.

Secure closure (patient safety). <BR>2.	Lightweight (patient comfort).<BR>3.	Air Permeable/Breathable (patient comfort).<BR>4.	Product has features to provide comfort to user (patient comfort).<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process. After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above. However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines. <BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative. <BR>

<DESC><p>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Cogent Communications Inc-1, 1015 31st Street NW, Washington, DC 20007-4406 in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 for the renewal of two 100MB fiber optic circuits for Internet Connectivity, for a base period and three one-year option periods. Cogent has wired (with fiber optic cable) the building that houses FinCEN offices to its network and is the only Internet provider to have done so. Therefore, Cogent can provide high bandwidth fiber optic connect (100MB) to the Internet for FinCEN and other building customers at low cost to the user. A new provider would be cost prohibitive to FinCEN and result in a disruption of service. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response. FinCEN will consider written responses received no later than 4:00 p.m. EST December 12, 2008 and must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is a certified installer of 100MB fiber optic circuits for Internet Connectivity and can propose on the open market portion of this requirement. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole source award to Cogent Communications Inc-1. No telephone inquires will be accepted.</p>

Our previous work has been conducted with Affymetrix GeneChip expression microarrays.<span>&nbsp; </span>Continuing work on arrays with the same platform design will allow for data to be directly comparable without introducing additional unknown variables. Affymetrix sells from inventory, more than 20 different GeneChip expression arrays including those designed for hosts of the fungal phytopathogens to be included on the microarray: Arabidopsis, tomato, wheat, barley and rice. The range of organisms, information density for arrays and broad selection of microarray products is unique to Affymetrix.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having the same expression platform for pathogen and host will allow for simultaneous expression studies in both organisms with directly compatible results. All equipment and infrastructure is in place in St. Paul for processing Affymetrix arrays including the GeneChip Scanner 3000, Fluidics Station 450, 640 Hybridization Oven, GCOS/ GeneChip command console, GTC, expression console, GCOS Server and GCOS Development Server Software, External Developers' Packages, NetAffx and other supporting software packages, service and technical support.<span>&nbsp; </span>Purchase of microarrays of different design may require purchase of additional equipment or software for analysis.This requirement is part of&nbsp; ongoing research and the capabilities to hybridize and scan these chips have been previously set up by Affymetrix as part of their core service. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Affymetrix without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>

<p>ANTI-ROLL TANK REPAIRS AND PRESERVATION</p>
<p>1. SCOPE This Detail Specification contains the requirements for repairing cracked welds, installing gussets and blasting and painting the interior of the Anti-Roll tank on the NOAA Ship HENRY B. BIGELOW.</p>
<p>2. References</p>
<p>a. NOAA Standard Specification MOC-000-3C, General Requirements for Small Contract ship Repairs</p>
<p>3. Government Furnished Material</p>
<p>a. None.</p>
<p>4. Requirements</p>
<p>a. Reference (a) forms a part of these Detail Specifications. All provisions and requirements contained therein are applicable to all work items, including all additional work items which are authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. All work is scheduled to be performed at Newport Naval Station, 68 Peary Street, Newport, RI.</p>
<p>c. NOAA Ship HENRY B. BIGELOW, ABS ID Number 06142681, IMO Number 9349057, is a fully ABS classed ship. All modifications and repairs shall be accomplished in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Rules, maintaining the current ABS Classing. The NOAA Ship HENRY B. BIGELOW is currently classed &#61537; A1, Ice Class CO, &#61563;, &#61537; AMS, &#61537; DPS-1.</p>
<p>d. The Contractor is responsible for the control, handling, and disposal of any hazardous materials generated during accomplishment of this contract.</p>
<p>e. Remove all of the paint on the interior of the anti-roll tank using high pressure water. Remove all water and paint residue from the tank interior. NOTE: The entire tank is constructed of aluminum. The contractor may sandblast the paint off in lieu of the high pressure water.</p>
<p>f. Inspect, with the COTR, all welds on the tank interior and record on a condition report all cracked welds found. Repair all cracked welds up to 20 linear feet. Repair all cracked welds that are found. If repairs to cracked welds exceed 20 linear feet it will be considered additional work. In addition, completely weld the bottom (both sides) of the four corner baffles. The baffles are currently stitch welded on each side along the deck.</p>
<p>g. Fabricate eight gussets to reinforce the existing baffles. The gussets shall be fabricated out of &frac14; inch 5086-H116 marine grade aluminum. The gussets shall triangular with the length of the sides being 3 feet by 2 feet and sniped.</p>
<p>h. Install two gussets on the outboard side of each baffle. Space the gussets equally as possible along the baffles, i.e. 1/3 and 2/3 distance from the bulkheads, and shall be installed over frames located below the anti-roll tank for added strength. The gussets shall be welded all around.</p>
<p>i. Crop off the goosenecks on all four vents for the anti-roll tank and extend straight portion of the vents up to the top of the handrails. Reinstall each gooseneck.</p>
<p>j. Sandblast (SSPC-SP10 Near White Blast) the entire interior of the tank, including all baffles, to impart a 2-3 mil profile on all surfaces. Use non-metallic media when blasting the tank. Plug the two tank dump valves, located on the aft outboard sides of the tank, to prevent the sandblast material from getting into the valves.</p>
<p>k. Thoroughly clean the interior of the tank.</p>
<p>l. Paint the interior of the tank, the new vent pipe sections and all disturbed aluminum using two coats of bar-rust 235 at 5 mils dry coat. Install a stripe coat of a contrasting color over the first coat along all edges and welds. The top coat shall be white. Ensure that the new vent pipes have a 2-3 mil profile on the entire surface prior to painting.</p>
<p>5. Quality Assurance</p>
<p>a. COTR inspection.</p>

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a poster, informing employees of their rights concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and about all its plants and offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted.

Notice to Employees 
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. 
For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:

Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any
subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to
any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held

shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall
be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

 INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the Agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be file within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">TO ALL BIDDERS</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Amendment No. 1 to RFQ RC141963 is issued to answer several technical questions.&nbsp; The questions are found below, with the answers in blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">1- Does the unit need to be explosion proof and if so what DIV, CLASS and GROUP?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">No</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">2- What capacity do you need on the solvent carboy (gallons)?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">Enough capacity to hold one entire dump of the ultrasonic tank</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">3- Do you want the quick dump to drain to the carboy as well as the ultrasonic?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">The ultrasonic is the only basin that needs to drain into the carboy</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">4- Do you need a closure panel for the 19 x 19 cut-out panel (i.e. sliding door, removable panel or open)?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">The cut-out panel should be just an overlapping piece of stainless steel sheet that screws onto the unit.&nbsp; We will be putting in a round cut-out in the panel at a later date to fit a deposition system, which is why we need the panel to be removable.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Wet Process Station # 2 PFH6C<br />1- What capacity do you need on the acid carboy (gallons)?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">Enough capacity to take one entire drain of one etch-tank and one QDR drain. (two tanks-worth)</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><br />2- What temperatures do you need for the two etch baths?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">The etch baths do not need temperature control.&nbsp; They will operate at roughly ambient temperature</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><br />3- Do you want the baths to be a common drain to the carboy only?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">The baths should have a manual diverter valve to drain to the building system for occasional cleaning purposes.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">4- Do you want the quick dump to drain to the carboy as well as the two etch baths?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">Yes.&nbsp; The QDR should also have a diverter valve to drain to the building system as well.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Wet Process Station #&nbsp;3 PFH6C<br />1- is the sedimentation tank to be used fas a&nbsp;neutralizing the drain from the sink?</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">It is not for neutralization of chemistry - it is so that we can dump wastewater from a dicing saw or silicon cutting operation down that sink, or to rinse off silicon samples that have been cut and have silicon particulates still attached.&nbsp; The sedimentation tank is only to allow these silicon pieces to settle.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Except as hereby modified, all other terms and conditions remain the same.&nbsp; Bid closing date remains 12/12/2008.</span></p>

Description

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological Technologies Medical Science and Technology (S&T) Division, which includes both the Core and Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) programs, research and development program requirements. 

Scope:

The Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate of DTRA includes the Medical S&T Division which is charged with meeting the science and technology requirements for medical countermeasures to chemical, biological and radiological threat agents.  The Medical S&T program may be generally characterized as composed of diagnostic, pretreatment and therapeutic development emphases.  Included in the Medical S&T program is the TMTI, which is specifically focused on innovative technology and processes to address emerging pathogens, as well as the potential threat of genetically modified agents, through the development of genetic sequence libraries, platform technologies and broad-spectrum therapeutics.

Purpose:
The DoD implements a vigorous medical research and development program in chemical and biological defense with the goal of protecting the warfighter from the ramifications of biological and chemical warfare agents.  This BAA is focused on developing tools and countermeasures that can be brought into acquisition and fielded worldwide.  These products must demonstrate regulatory compliance, general robustness, and be highly effective at a reasonable cost.  Successful candidates must demonstrate a clear path to regulatory approval, production, and end user utility.  They must all be amenable to use in a military environment.
Solicitation Approach and Overview:

This BAA seeks optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within the CB Medical S&T Division?s Core and TMTI programs as outlined in the BAA.  The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to technology topics.  

This BAA will be a multi-year BAA, remaining effective for three years from the initial date of issuance, unless amended otherwise.  The topics and timelines published in the initial issuance are firm.  In the future, ongoing, new or emerging requirements may necessitate amendment of the BAA to include new or different topics.  At any time that the topics are amended, a new proposal submission timeline will also be specified.  These amendments are expected, generally, to occur on an as-needed basis, and may occur more often than annually, resulting in multiple calls for proposals from this BAA.  This BAA, in addition to any amendments issued in conjunction with this BAA, will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and for informational purposes on the DTRA website.  It is the responsibility of the offerors and interested parties to stay abreast of BAA amendments by regularly checking the FedBizOpps website.

Acquisition and assistance instruments that will be considered for use for award include FAR-based Contracts and Other Transaction Agreements, with a preference for FAR-based Contracts.  The government does not intend to award grants under this solicitation.  All other pertinent information can be found in the BAA solicitation document.

All questions (administrative or technical) related to this BAA must be e-mailed to CBMedicalBAA@dtra.mil.

<CONTACT>Dr. Heather McCallum-Bayliss, Program Manager, Fax 301-226-9137, Email dni-iarpa-baa-09-01@ugov.gov
<DESC><p>IARPA is seeking innovative solutions for the Socio-Cultural Content in Language (SCIL) Program. The Program intends to explore and develop novel designs, algorithms, methods, techniques and technologies to extend the discovery of the social goals of members of a group by correlating these goals with the language they use. Human language use reflects social and cultural norms, contexts and expectations. Social variables (such as religion, status, gender, education) and contextual features (such as formality, participant beliefs, social situation) can influence the form and features of language. Because language use responds to such social and cultural influences, then correlating social goals and language forms and content should provide a rich and expanded understanding of the attributes, roles and nature of the associations and intentions of the members of social groups.</p>
<p>The goals of the SCIL Program are<br />1) to use existing social science theories to identify the social goals of a group and its members; <br />2) to correlate these social goals with the language used by the members; <br />3) to automate this correlation; <br />4) to provide insight into and evidence for the nature and status of the group and the roles and relationships of its members; and <br />5) to attempt to generalize the behaviors across cultures in order to highlight the contrasts and similarities in accomplishing social goals.</p>
<p><br />Full IARPA-BAA-09-01 Document is Attached.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT the same BAA as was released on 06 February 2008 through the Department of Interior National Business Center AQD - Sierra Vista. Potential Offerors should be aware that the BAA has changed.</p>

Project number VUBV059124. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This project involves the construction of facilities including an Operations Building, 2 story 10,000 SF (6448 SF main floor, 3626 SF second floor), a new Vehicle Parking Addition 3360 SF, a Storage MAG AG (SAMS) building 600 SF, a Range Target Storage Building 4800 SF, a Range Residue Holding Area (metal building system) 3200 SF, an Electric Generator Building 386 SF, Extend/Modify existing Storage Building 3150 square feet, and Total Demolition of 5385 SF. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Operations Building and supporting Electric Generator Building has a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slab, with precast concrete and brick on block wall (CMU) construction on exterior, with CMU and gypsum board on metal stud walls on interior, paint, and vinyl wall coverings. Roof: standing seam metal roof on metal bar joist. Mechanical: Heat pump units, with geothermal ground source field and loop and a fire suppression system reservoir storage tank which is rain-water-fed and supports sewage disposal, typical HVAC. Electrical: fluorescent light, outlets, A/V, Data and voice, Mass notification, and fire alarm system. The site will include concrete sidewalks and parking areas, 7' galvanized fencing and an operable arm gate. All other buildings are metal building systems used primarily for storage and repair and are constructed out of metal panels on steel frame/girts and standing seam metal roofs on metal purlins. Some buildings will be heated. Exterior work includes: extending existing utilities and road access to each facility, upgrading the operations area site with new fences, gates and parking area, repairing sewage lagoon fences, extending communication trunks to new and existing buildings and upgrading the existing entry gate. Provide temporary facilities during building construction to allow facility demolition in the footprint of construction. Additional supporting facilities and infrastructure include: a new generator building to house backup power requirements for the existing air traffic control tower, relocation/rebuild of the fuel station to provide more fuel efficient fuel management and operations, upgrade of the existing sewage lagoons (deteriorated fences and gates), and upgrade of existing main entry gate to meet security requirements. New infrastructure will extend water, gas, sewer, electrical and communications systems as required to each new building and support facility. Project will incorporate Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and sustainable development concepts.</span></p>

This amendment #0005 incorporates the questions and answers received to date, and is successive (Amendment #0004 was transmitted but due to technical errors, not posted to the Fed Biz Opps website as intended on 12-9-08).  As such, this amendment #0005 takes the place of the missing Amendment #0004.

However, the solicitation states that the size standard for this contract is $7M.  Will our firm be considered a small or large business under this procurement, and if selected, will we be required to submit a subcontracting plan?
ANSWER:  In order for a firm to be considered small under the proposed projects NAICS code, the annual receipts must be under the current threshold of $7Million, as set by the SBA.  The firm should consult with the SBA as to the size status under a NAICS they do not normally provide services for.

4.	Please clarify and describe the intended role and services to be provided under "Marine Architecture".ANSWER:  Again, specific projects to be performed by this IDIQ have not been determined at this time.  The list of required and additional services has been developed based on a range of past projects.  Intended roles and specific requirements for disciplines will be developed as projects develop.
5.	Are the SF 330 Part IIs included in the 100 page limitation?
ANSWER:  Yes. 6.	 After reviewing the other amendments, we would like further clarification regarding the "portfolio" referenced, and how it relates to the SF 330 Section F: Example Project Experience;  By "portfolio" are you referring to the Section F project sheets, or additional project information? 
ANSWER:  Portfolio makes reference to section F. 
7.	Please clarify how many projects can be used in Section F.	
ANSWER:  Submittals intended to represent Section F should consist of only five (5) projects.   
This is the final amendment for this project.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reopen solicitation, DAAE20-02-R-0193, to augment the award pools established for full and open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1  5 to promote additional competition and production capacity. The solicitation, originally issued on September 13, 2002 is for the procurement of various sets, kits, and outfits and may be referred to as the SKO solicitation. The term sets, kits, and outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment used to support the Armys tactical and combat support weapon systems and its ordnance and combat missions. This amendment may result in the award of multiple contracts set to expire concurrently with the existing award pool contracts on 31 Jan 2013. A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that segment. This amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements. We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses. Delivery Orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation, DAAE20-02-R-0193. The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an order will be placed against that contract. The award only signifies that the awardee is eligible to compete for delivery orders pursuant to the fair opportunity to compete provisions. We will use the contracts, consistent with the fair opportunity to compete provisions, to fulfill its SKO requirements unless otherwise exempted by law or regulation. In order to promote competition this requirement was divided into the following segments in the original solicitation: Segment 1 Mechanical Tool Kits: An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair. The kit is transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container. These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 2 Construction/Engineer Tool Kits: An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container. These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 3 Specialized Tool Kits: Assemblages of hand tools and equipment, or special purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical or building trades. These kits may be housed in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 4 Containerized Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set. Usually, some of the components of a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 5 Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set. Usually, some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its carrier by mounting bolts or other fasteners. These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segments 1  5 will be individually competed and awarded under this amendment. The Army intends to augment, or add to, the award pools already established for each segment: one under full and open competition and the other for small business concerns. As stated in the original solicitation, the Government reserves the right to augment the award pools from time to time to promote additional competition or to secure production capacity concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments (Segments 1-5) in accordance with the Section L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors in this amendment. Each segment shall require Offerors to submit a technical proposal (All Segments), past performance proposal (All Segments) and Small Business Participation (Segments 1-4) based on the sample requirement that was used to create the award pools under the original solicitation. The sample for each of the segments is as follows: Segment 1: Small Arms Repairman Tool Kit; Segment 2: Engineer Construction Carpenter Tool Kit; Segment 3: Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tool Kit; Segment 4: Set, Standard Automotive Tool; Segment 5: Shop Equipment Welder. These DFPs are located on our open solicitation page as Attachments 001, 003, 005, 008, and 0012. Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the section entitled Evaluation Factors for Award included in this amendment. Contract clauses that will be applicable to resulting award pool contracts will be included in this amendment. Contractors that are awarded contracts to get into the SKO segments are expected to respond to our RFPs and bid on at least 25% of the items within the segment. Points of contact: Michael Good, michael.v.good@us.army.mil ; Celeste Hobert, celeste.hobert@us.army.mil; Roxanne Spurgetis, roxanne.spurgetis@us.army.mil for all SKO Segments. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aaia.ria.army.mil/aais/solinfo/index.htm. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for bid opening/receipt of proposals may render your bid or proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of same. THE ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE OF THE SOLICITATION IS 29 DEC 2008. THIS IS AN ESTIMATED DATE ONLY AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE RESPONSE DATE ON THIS NOTICE IS FOR ARCHIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT THE DATE OFFERS ARE DUE.

Jordan  Smart Card Technology.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance related to the introduction of a national Smart Card.

Jordan has adopted a comprehensive Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector modernization as a principle agent for national transformation and development.  In March 2008, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) issued a Request for Information for a National Smart Card system, whereby interested companies describe their technologies, qualifications and solutions in a formal document to the ministry.  This is a way for MOI to learn more about the market and the state of technology.  MOI has been making concrete steps toward the implementation of the Smart Card Technology; however, it would benefit greatly from technically sound advice and recommendations to successfully implement this very complicated project.  The Technical Assistance consultant would assist the Government of Jordan in defining the strategy for the implementation of the Smart Card, identifying the governments needs, and determining how to shape the procurement.  MOI has planned to implement the Smart Card technology in three phases.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding would support the implementation of the first phase, which would include the national identity card, voting application, health insurance card, drug dispensing card, and an electronic authentication for online government services.  Phases two and three would expand the Smart Card to other areas that have not yet been formally defined. 

Jordans Smart Card project is a stated national priority project that has the personal support of the King, the Royal Court, the National Security and Crisis Management Center and the national government.  Through the implementation of the Smart Card project, Jordan seeks to stimulate and catalyze electronic transactions throughout the Jordanian government and economy.  The Smart Card system is intended as a centerpiece of Jordans overall e-government program.  Since Jordan is in the information gathering stage of the procurement process, it is precisely at this time that the government requires technical and management assistance to bring the project to fruition.  This project represents an opportunity for USTDA to make a significant impact on an important initiative.

The grant was signed by the Minister of Planning and International Cooperation on behalf of MOI.  While MOI is the primary implementing body, it is advised closely by the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology.

The study includes: an internal needs assessment; development of a Smartcard National Strategy Framework; risk analysis; identification of potential funding; legal and regulatory analysis; identification of vendor evaluation criteria; support of Request for Proposals document; detailed financial and economic analysis; a preliminary environmental impact assessment; and a development benefit assessment.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $410,083 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by January 26, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

(SOURCE CONTROL REFERENCE) 

Documentation of Traceability (Oct 2008)

    Products offered under this acquisition shall be
    in complete compliance with the item description
    on the schedule page and shall be new and
    unused, unless former Government surplus is
    evaluated and approved.

    If the offeror is not identified as an
    approved/qualified source in the item
    description, the offeror must submit
    traceability documentation to the Contracting
    Officer on or before the date that quotes/offers
    are due.  The documentation can be mailed, faxed
    or scanned and e-mailed.  The Contracting
    Officer may also require or consider additional
    evidence prior to award to establish the
    identity of the item and its manufacturing
    source.  Failure to provide any required
    documentation within the stated timeframe may
    result in rejection of the offer.

    Traceability documentation must, at a minimum,
    include the following:

    (1)If the offeror is an authorized
    dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified
    source and for the specific item being procured:

    (a) The offeror must furnish one of the
    following: a copy of its current
    dealer/distributorship agreement, a letter of
    authorization from the approved/qualified
    source, or a link to the approved/qualified
    source's website which clearly identifies the
    offeror as an authorized dealer/distributor.

    (b) By providing this documentation, the offeror
    represents that the dealer/distributor
    relationship with the approved/qualified source
    applies to the  item being procured. If the
    offeror's dealer/distributor status with the
    approved/qualified source changes either before
    or after award, the offeror will promptly notify
    the contracting officer.

    (2)If the offeror is not an authorized
    dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified
    source the offeror must provide the following:

    (a) If offered item(s) are "not in stock/not
    currently owned by the offeror" or "not yet
    manufactured":

    The offeror must furnish a verifiable quotation
    from the approved/qualified source to the
    offeror or from an authorized dealer/distributor
    to the offeror.  The quote must include the
    approved/qualified source's part number (or Mil
    Spec Type Designation), quantity sufficient to
    satisfy the solicitation requirement and date of
    quotation.  The quotation must either be on
    letter head from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer distributor to the
    offeror, or an electronic quote clearly
    identifiable as coming from the
    approved/qualified source or authorized
    dealer/distributor to the offeror.  If the
    products will be obtained from an authorized
    dealer/distributor, the information described in
    (1) must be provided to establish the authorized
    dealer/distributor arrangement.

    (b) If offered item(s) are "shipped" or "in
    stock/currently owned by the offeror", the
    offeror must furnish one of the following
    documents:

    (i) The invoice from the approved/qualified
    source or an authorized dealer/distributor to
    the offeror, or the packing slip which
    accompanied shipment from the approved/qualified
    source or authorized dealer/distributor to the
    offeror.  The document must be dated and include
    the following elements:  name and address of the
    approved/qualified source; the
    approved/qualified part number (or Mil Spec Type
    Designation); quantity sufficient to satisfy the
    solicitation requirement; and the offeror's name
    and address.  If the products were obtained from
    an authorized dealer/distributor, the
    information described in (1) must be provided to
    establish the authorized dealer/distributor
    arrangement.

    (ii) In addition, if MIL-M-38510, MIL-PRF-38534,
    MIL-PRF-38535, or MIL-PRF-19500 applies, the
    offeror must provide a copy of the Certificate
    of Conformance required by the specification.
    Note:  this does not alleviate the requirements
    in the DLAD clause 52.246-9042, Documentation of
    Traceability - QPL/QML Integrated Circuits,
    Hybrid Microcircuits, and Semiconductor Devices.


    (3) If the products to be furnished are not
    obtained directly from an approved/qualified
    source or an authorized dealer/distributor of an
    approved/qualified source, the offeror must
    provide the documentation described in (2)
    establishing the complete line of ownership or
    distribution from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer/distributor to the
    offeror.

    Notwithstanding any documentation provided prior
    to contract award, the Government reserves the
    right to require additional documentation
    attesting to the authenticity of the material at
    any time before or after contract delivery.

    If the solicitation indicates Inspection and
    Acceptance at Destination, the Government
    reserves the right to change to Inspection and
    Acceptance at Origin at time of award, and to
    incorporate DLAD clause 52.246-9004, Product
    Verification Testing.

<AWARDEE>AOAC International, 481 N. Frederick Ave., Gaithersburg, MD 20877 US
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), is responsible for the inspection of meat and poultry products to assure they are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and properly label in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations.  To assure compliance with departmental regulations under Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S. C. 451 et seq.), laboratory analyses are periodically conducted on samples of meat and poultry products to determine the presence of food additives, environmental contaminants, veterinary drug residues, microbial toxins and pathogenic bacteria, and identify economically fraudulent products.

As the demands on the FSIS laboratories increased over the years, it became clear that action was required to maintain the quality and expeditious handling of official samples. On November 7, 1980, the FSIS published a proposed rule in the FEDERAL REGISTER (45 FR 73947) to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations.  FSIS proposed:  

1)	To establish standards for the analytical chemical procedures to be performed on official meat and poultry samples by non-Federal chemistry laboratories.

2)	To consolidate standards and procedures previously established under the Certified Laboratory Program and the Recognized Laboratory Program.

The final rule amending 9 CFR Parts 318 and 381 was published on January 20, 1987 (52 FR 2176).  The result of the rule was the establishment of the Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP).  A 1991 amendment to the 1990 Farm Bill required user fees for FSIS Laboratory accreditation.  The final rule amending 9 CFR Parts 318, 381 and 391 for the revised user fee Accredited Laboratory Program was published on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65254).

Under the Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP), FSIS accredits and provides administrative program management over participating private and State laboratories that test meat and poultry products for: Food Chemistry (moisture, protein, fat, and salt (MPFS)); and Residue Chemistry (chlorinated hydrocarbons; polychlorinated biphenyls; arsenic; sulfonamides; and nitrosamines) for which a check sample program for quality assurance is conducted.  Currently, there are approximately 80 accredited laboratories in the program. 

In 1999, an audit by USDAs Office of the Inspector General cited a deficiency in the number of on-site reviews made to accredited laboratories (sixteen (16) laboratories were reviewed in FY97 and five (5) in FY99).  This was due to significant staffing shortage in the program. The procurement of this contract will help FSIS fulfill its obligation to conduct on-site reviews of its accredited laboratories.
