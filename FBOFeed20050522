SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

Evaluation Factors & Criteria:
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Sub factor 1: Capacity to Perform Quality Work:  Each offeror is to describe how its company’s methods and procedures will be applied in such a manner as to ensure that only quality work is performed by its own work force and all of its subcontractors in accordance with the contract requirements.    Offerors are to describe how their management methods, procedures and schedules will be applied in order to monitor project work progress during construction, and implement corrective actions in order to make-up for lost time.    
Sub factor 2: Economic Involvement & Use of Local Iraqi Firms and Workers:  Explicitly state or describe your goals for the maximum involvement of:

Sub factor 4: Delivery Schedule:  Offerors will state how they will accomplish the requirements with-in a 180 day schedule (design-build phase).  Days counted are calendar days.
All sub factors in Factor 1: Technical are weighted equally.

Factor 2:  Price - 

(a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a) (1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	(b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed

Factor 3:  Past Performance - 

The offeror will submit a resume of work experience that is similar in scope to this project.  The past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The following relevancy criteria apply:
