<p>Description:<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Surgery Branch (SB), plans to procure, on a sole source basis, custom gene synthesis and custom peptide synthesis services from GenScript USA, Inc,; 860 Centennial Ave.; Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.</p>
<p>The response close date of this notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the IDIQ contract is thirty-six (36) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute is a combined laboratory and clinical research unit devoted to the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies and their translation to the treatment of patients with cancer. Efforts run the gamut from basic studies of cancer immunology to the conduct of clinical immunotherapy trials for patients with metastatic cancer. The Surgery Branch was responsible for the development of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the first effective immunotherapy in humans, the development of cell transfer immunotherapies for melanoma and other solid cancers, the first insertion of foreign genes into humans and the first development of effective human cancer immunotherapies based on the genetic engineering of autologous lymphocytes with genes encoding anti-tumor T cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors.</p>
<p>Examples of current laboratory research involve the identification of the optimal properties of lymphocytes capable of mediating anti-tumor effects in experimental models and in the human and the development of immunotherapies based on the identification of unique exomic mutations expressed by cancers that can be targeted by cell transfer therapy. Extensive programs are in place for the genetic modification of lymphocytes to target cancer-testes antigens.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Surgery Branch (SB) is developing immune-based therapies to treat patients with metastatic cancer. One of the branch's current major therapeutic strategies is to use tumor mutation-reactive T cells to treat patients with cancer. This is based on data from the SB clinical trials demonstrating that the curative responses seen in patients with melanoma treated with T cells are likely mediated by mutation-reactive T cells. Moreover, the NCI treated a patient with metastatic bile duct cancer with a highly pure population of mutation-reactive T cells and are observing ongoing tumor regression at 16+ months after therapy. The SB is thus attempting to treat more patients with mutation-reactive T cells. In order to do this, the SB first must identify mutation-reactive T cells from patients. The reagents that the branch requires to identify mutation-reactive T cells are custom genes and custom peptides that encode for tumor mutations. Since the SB is using these reagents in "real time" to develop therapies to treat patients with late stage cancer, the branch requires that these reagents be synthesized quickly, be error-free and that the product sequences are of high quality.</p>
<p>One major focus of the Branch is to develop T-cell therapies that target mutations expressed by the patients' cancer. This process begins with the resection of tumor from the patient. The T cells within the tumor are then grown in the lab. The SB performs whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing on the tumors to identify somatic mutations. Once the branch has a list of mutations, the SB requires the synthesis of mini-gene constructs that encode the mutations, and also short and long peptides that encode the mutations. This is where the branch requires the proposed source to provide high quality genes and peptides for NCI's experiments in a timely manner. Once the branch obtains these constructs encoding the mutations, the SB interrogates whether the T cells grown out from the patients' tumor recognize any of these mutations. If there are T cells that recognize any of these mutations, then the branch selects those T cells to treat the patient. The patients being treated at the SB are late-stage patients with no other therapeutic options, thus the NCI requires that all these reagents be synthesized in an expeditious manner as time is of the essence. This process is required for every single patient on the SB protocol (i.e., this is highly personalized medicine/therapy).</p>

A variety of approaches are evaluated at the molecular, biochemical, cellular, and physiological levels including the impact of the tumor microenvironment and metabolic mutations to improve cancer treatment. Intentional or accidental exposure of humans to ionizing radiation or a course of definitive radiation therapy can lead to cancer induction or second malignancies. Research studies are directed to identify interventions to delay or prevent radiation-induced cancer after the exposure has occurred. Emphasis is placed on gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of cell killing and protection and the activation/inhibition of complex signaling pathways mediated by oxidative stress, including ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).</p>
<p>Metabolomics is the global, systematic identification and quantitation of metabolites in a given organism or biological samples, including cells, tissue, blood, and urine. The enhanced atomic-level resolution of metabolic analysis provided by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) along with powerful chemometric software allows for the simultaneous determination and comparison of thousands of chemical entities. At present, existing intramural resources at the NCI for standardized, high quality metabolomics analyses are limited due to a lack of dedicated instrumentation configured for metabolomics. Although there are several NMR spectrometers installed in Building 10, the CCR currently does not operate an NMR that is configured, optimized and dedicated for metabolomics applications such as targeted mechanistic Stable Isotope-Resolved tracer studies in cultured cells and tissues as well as targeted and untargeted NMR-based discovery and diagnostic studies in patient-derived surgical specimens, biopsies, and biofluids such as plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. The NMR spectrometer specified in this Acquisition is fine-tuned for the needs of proton-detected 13C or 15N stable isotope experiments as well as rapid analysis of intact surgical tissue and biopsy specimens by high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall provide the following salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics, inclusive of hardware and/or software specifications, that are deemed essential to the needs of the Government:</p>
<p>&bull; 16.44T superconducting magnet system with 5.4cm central bore, with integrated magnet shimming and locking systems, operational frequency of 700MHz.<br />&bull; 3mm ultra-high sensitivity helium-cooled Inverse Triple Resonance CryoProbe<br />&bull; 5mm room temperature Inverse Triple Resonance Probe<br />&bull; 5mm Multinuclear Broadband Observe Probe.<br />&bull; Refrigerated 24-place automated sample changer<br />&bull; high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) probe and regulation unit<br />&bull; BCU-II pre-cooling and stabilization unit, needed for high resolution operation of the CryoProbe and HR-MAS probe.<br />&bull; AssureNMR Summit software package with 15 year license, needed for analysis of sample spectra, determination of instrument performance, and untargeted metabolomics analyses.<br />&bull; Test and system suitability sample sets, required for determination of instrument performance.</p>
<p>DELIVERY / INSTALLATION<br />Delivery address:<br />National Institutes of Health<br />National Cancer Institute<br />Center for Cancer Research, Center for Cancer Metabolism<br />9000 Rockville Pike<br />Building 10, Room 3B32 <br />Bethesda, MD 20892</p>
<p>The magnet, console, and all associated machinery and instrumentation shall be delivered within seven (7) months of purchase order award. The specially-made 3mm Triple Resonance Inverse Detection CryoProbe shall be delivered within thirteen (13) months after receipt of order.</p>
<p>TRAINING<br />This acquisition includes a full battery of instrument calibration standards to be used during and following installation. Also included are eight days of training courses for no less than three (3) CCM facility staff.</p>
<p>PAYMENT<br />Payment shall be made in arrears after delivery, installation, inspection and acceptance, and successful completion of the required training stated above. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoices to the NCI Technical Point of Contact and the NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM), in accordance with the payment provisions in the order.</p>
<p><br />This equipment is manufactured by Bruker Biospin Corp. The proposed source is the only known source on the market that provides an instrument with all of the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Need required for the cancer metabolism research being conducted at the NCI. Although several high field NMR spectrometers currently exist in the NCI, and in the NIH Intramural Program as a whole, nearly all of these spectrometers are configured for protein structural and dynamic studies, which typically involve scans of a single sample lasting up to several days in duration. Moreover, these spectrometers are not configured for high-throughput sample measurements required by the MC. Therefore, none of these instruments are currently configured for dedicated targeted and untargeted metabolomics protocols and procedures conducted by the MC. In addition, none of these instruments are available for the MC's use and method development on a regular basis. Furthermore, there is no comparable technology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nor other viable sources available in order to advance the MC's scientific mission.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 1:00PM EDT, on Aug. 9, 2017. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov. Reference: N02RC72558-76 on all correspondence.</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted<br />(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or<br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(End of clause)<br />52.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013)<br />(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>

Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities. <br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting <br />3. Identify constraints in transparency <br />(b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />(c) Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />(d)There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&not;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.

The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity). <br />(e) After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />(f) The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />(g) Questions regarding items (a) through (f) within this language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)<br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -<br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>
<p>(b) General Guidelines<br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.<br />2. In performing or presenting the results of scientific activities under the contract, and in responding to allegations of scientific and research misconduct, the Contractor shall comply with the provisions herein and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-735D, Scientific Integrity, and its Procedural Handbook, including any amendments thereto.<br />3. Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so.<br />4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.<br />5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research<br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the contracting officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall: <br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.<br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator.

(3) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests.<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.
