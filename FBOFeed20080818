<p><br />1. Paragraph 3.2.1 only addresses installation of the new chamber and all of its components and should not be confused with any other stages of this project. Paragraph 3.2 and Table 1.0 (Delivery Schedule Line Item # 0003) address the demolition of the old chamber and site preparation. Old chamber demolition is anticipated to be completed well before the new chamber's manufacture is complete, weeks before its delivery and installation. As stated in Addendum Section 1. C., any required removal of the old gypsum leveling course and asbestos abatement shall take place after the old chamber has been removed and before any necessary site preparation, in accordance with (IAW) the offeror's detailed control plan. The worst case time frame for this abatement is 14 calendar days. AFPTEF will work closely with the contractor to fit the abatement into their detailed control plan.</p>
<p>Addendum Attachment 1</p>
<p>The addendum was added to provide information to ensure that any site preparation or facility modification will meet the requirements of Base Civil Engineering (CE) in order to obtain Base CE final approval. Standard re-connection of the chamber to base utilities require only standard practices. There is nothing, otherwise, in the addendum requiring a response by an offeror.</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of VMWare SW.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/CS requires the purchase of VM Ware SW.  After investigating VMWare, CITRIX and Microsoft products, our group concluded that VMWare provided us with the best solution. Unlike its competitors VMWare is a more stable, mature, robust and resilient technology which has already been deployed within the Department of State. These benefits are important to us because not only are we able to mimic the technologies that the applications will be deployed with but, we also have some assurance that the product will work as needed.  Additionally, since the Department of State already has experience using this technology, we have a knowledge base in which to draw upon to help us support the deployment. In addition, the following items support our request for VMWare:
	The Microsoft Hyper-V solution is not sufficient for Enterprise Solution at this juncture.	CITRIX XenCENTER software management solution is relatively new to the market and there are many unknowns and thus you can expected higher administration costs.	VMWare allows more flexibility to host more guest operating systems than the competitors.
CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to purchase VM Ware SW.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with Wyle Information Systems via single source procedures.
The FAA intends to award a sole source, bridge contract for maintenance and management of Nortel administrative Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems, non-Nortel PBX manufacturer PBX switches, Voice Mail, Conference Bridge, and core Emergency Communications capabilities to Wyle Information Systems.  	The FAA intends to re-procure, on a full and open competitive basis National Administrative PBX Voice Systems and Maintenance services, to include both the 61 sites covered under the current VTS contract with Wyle as well as 824 sites covered under a number of regional contracts. A full and open competitive contract will be awarded in approximately August 2009. Accordingly a bridge contract with Wyle is needed to continue performance until the new (competitive) contract is awarded.	The implementation of a one-year bridge contract fulfils the requirement for a best value action and will aid the FAA in it's pursuit of the competitive award.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above service.  The FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Kathy St. Hill not later than 12 noon, Easter Standard Time, 29 August 2008.  Responses may be sent via e-mail to Kathy.Sthill@faa.gov

The USG has determined through evaluations that theadditional shipping, labor, materials, possible replacement costs, and thepotential increased risks to the equipment and to the SLD Programsobjectivesthat would be entailed in changing from one contractor to another at thistimeis too expensive to justify.  This is a notice of intent to awardsole-sourceand is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, firms who want tochallenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstratesthefirms ability to provide the services described above.  All interestedfirmsmust respond to DE-AC52-08NA28621 by 3:00pm MST, Friday, September 5, 2008to:Katherine Weber, NNSA Service Center, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque NM87185-5400or to kweber@doeal.gov.  A determination by the Government not to competethisproposed contracted based upon responses to this notice is solely withinthediscretion of the Government.  Information received will normally beconsideredsolely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitiveprocurement.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of the responsesreceived from this notice, since this notice cannot be considered a formalsolicitation document.  See Note 22.

The BD FACSAria Cell sorter will be used to perform immune system studies on the cellular level using proven methods of flow cytometry, on blood and tissue samples.

The following salient characteristics apply to the BD FACSAria Cell Sorter:

1.   	Analysis and sorting capabilities (multilaser, >10 flourescent parameters and contained within a unit of the same size)

	2. 	Capable of 13 color, 15 parameter analysis as well as cell sorting

3.	ULPA aerosol management system with three lasers and 12 colors 

4.	Option to upgrade to up to five lasers and eighteen colors

BD Biosciences is uniquely qualified to provide flow cytometers as it is the only manufacturer to provide both required methods of automatic setup, fixed laser alignment aerosol management and environmental control of cells. The BD instrument is the only automated fixed alignment flow cytometer cell sorter instrument with a significant local install base. The NCI has more than ten of these instruments and the continuity of research and availability of like type instrument trained technicians is critical to experiment throughput. All current data acquisition and analysis in the Immunology section is being performed using BD proprietary software and switching vendors would put the continuity of research at risk.

	The contractor will lay out the inquiry process and track the sequential collection of data to ensure that the data are uniformly collected and categorized. 
Dr. Brown and the UCLA Center staff are uniquely qualified to lead this research project because continuity in data is imperative for the continuation of this study

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to procure on a sole source basis existing blood and urine analyses to examine the correlation of these analyses in higher risk of cancers of the esophagus, stomach or kidneys with Kaiser Permanente, Division of Research, 2000 Broadway  Oakland, California 94612-2304.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Period of Performance: September 15, 2008 through September 14, 2009.

The primary objective of the procurement is to evaluate whether abnormalities shown in routine urine and blood analyses are related to subsequent risk of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and kidney.  The data must be able to address the following public health questions: 1) long-term risk of kidney cancer in relation to levels of urine albumin and sugar levels collected during routine physical examinations; 2) long-term risk of esophageal and gastric cancers in relation to complete blood count and hematocrit levels collected during routine physical examinations; 3) whether the association is different for anatomic subsite and histologic subtype of these malignancies; 4) the pattern of associations by patient characteristics, such as gender, age, and race/ethnic groups; 5) the pattern of associations by the duration and severity of abnormality and other relevant comorbid conditions as available; and 6) whether the associations are modified or confounded by other risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and Helicobacter pylori infection.

The Kaiser Permanente is the only source known to the National Cancer Institute to be able to carry out the tasks specified in the procurement because it meets all of the specified criteria including capacity of data referencing the study of blood and urine and its relation to higher cancer risk in individuals.  Being the largest plan in the NCI-supported Cancer Research Network, a consortium of research Health Maintenance Organizations, the Northern California Kaiser Permanente has a current membership of over 3.2 million individuals.  It is also the earliest established plan (since 1942) among the network of HMOs, ensuring both a large study population size and a sufficient length of follow-up to observe incident cancer diagnosis.  About half of the plan members are Caucasians, followed by Hispanics (19%), Asian Americans (17%), and African Americans (8%), ensuring sufficient numbers for separate analyses among racial/ethnic minorities because of lack of data in these ethic groups for this study. Different racial and ethnic groups have varying levels of risk given to a specific factor. Testing each group provides concrete data for this analysis. In addition, the plan conducted a number of separate cohort studies with more detailed collection of data by personal interviews and banking of blood samples for molecular analysis, including a large cohort of over 130,000 adults who received a multiphasic health examination and were interviewed during 1977 through 1985.  More detailed data on potential confounding factors are available in these data, including status of H. pylori infection, which is unlikely to be available in other cohorts with routine blood and urine analysis data.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM ET September 3, 2008.  Faxed and E-mailed capability statements are not authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at Holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The initial Technology Insertion into the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) spiral 1.2 of Increment I includes the delivery of a video archival system that's capable of integrating varied sensor data.  The archival of data needs to support the DJC2 content search and discovery requirements of the program without tight software integration.  This enables DJC2's portal and net-centric data strategy to co-exist and leverage current DJC2 software services.  Further, the myriad of sensor data that DJC2 handles due to its requirement to support Geographic Combatant Commanders in varied mission requirements implies that a system must handle all ephemeris encoding methodologies in use in the field. This is the only known system that handles the ephemeris data in an open method and allows that data to be tagged within DJC2's net-centric data strategy.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City Division, Florida intends to award a purchase order based on a limited competition between Icon Polymer, Ltd. Nottinghamshire, UK and Trelleborg Engineered Systems (Reeves Brothers, Inc) 790 Reeves St, US-Spartanburg, SC 29301 for the procurement of Bag Materials of the type T2: 75 linear yards, T3: 140 linear yards, T5: 120 linear yards (of two-ply material). This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason:  This material procurement is a continuation of the Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program, so should be limited to the previously identified FCT vendors that are currently participating in the program.  These vendors have already submitted materials (or similar derivatives) which have been tested and shown to meet the requirements of the LCAC Project Peculiar Document (PPD) No. 8024336529 Skirt Material Characteristics and Requirements.  The inclusion of new vendors with untested, unproved materials would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through additional competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. Award will be based on a best-value decision.  Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, Panama City Division, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 313320 applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees. PSC is 9320.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This combined synopsis/solicitation SHALL be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/ ).  The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N00244-08-T-0638.  This solicitation documents incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-26 effective June 12, 2008 and DFARS Change Notice 20080722.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.   The NAICS code is 334511 and the Small Business Standard is 750 employees.  A single award, firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to be awarded as a result of this RFQ.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to Blue View Technologies, 2151 N. Northlake Way, Seattle, WA 98103-9175.  The attached RFQ contains a complete descriptions and applicable provisions and clauses.  
The BV-3000 pole-mounted blazed array sonar is the only known imaging sonar that meets the requirement. This type of sonar has already been integrated onto the Naval Post Graduates (NPS) ARIES and REMUS underwater vehicles. The BV-3000 uses the same software and sonar arrays as these other NPS vehicles. Therefore, it can produce sonar imagery compatible with NPS image-processing and obstacle avoidance algorithms that currently detect underwater objects from up to 80 meters away. The BV-3000 system includes vertical and horizontal sonar heads to measure the height and width of objects in its field of view and its built-in pan/tilt actuator can be interfaced to the USV autopilot so SeaFox can steer the field of view relative to its trajectory. In this way, the system will be capable of imaging the three-dimensional region surrounding the USV. Finally, the system has telescoping poles that can extend underwater even from the SeaFox transom located about 5 feet above the waterline.
Authority is granted under the procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Other Than Full and Open Competition.  This announcement will close at 4:00pm 19 August 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, with Maquet located at 1140 US-22, Suite 202 Bridgewater, NJ 08807 for services and supplies  to include, but  may not be limited to, the following:Contractor to install Ceiling Service Units - OR BoomsEquipment Description                            The BOOMS are a new range of ceiling service units expressly designed for operating rooms, intensive care and emergency units. Modules have been designed to offer large, unobstructed surface area for positioning outlets, accessories, and shelving to consolidate and organize equipment, utilities, and communications systems.Key Features include: High Capacity With Open Architecture    The very large, internal channel (up to 4.7 inches - 120 mm) is ideal for current and future capacity requirements (including multimedia use). The Boom range - from the light arm to the high capacity arm - has a reach of 24 to 94 inches (60 to 240 cm) using a combination of single or double arms. This provides excellent flexibility and modular site integration.Integration/Adaptability    The BOOM range incorporates all of the outlets and connections - all the way to the ceiling - that are essential for handling the various signals used in video, monitoring and integration. The option of cable management outputs on the module offers even greater flexibility in the choice of integration partners. Therefore, cables are easy to install and are given lasting protection. BOOM panels support all kinds of outlets, including multimedia, video, telephone and nurse call.Flexible and Easy to PositionThe booms can be easily moved due to their considerable rigidity and tapered roller bearings. Combined with friction brakes, this extra stability provides maximum strength for the workstation. Optional electropneumatic brakes make positioning of heavy loads easy.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a sole source contract for a software license renewal with Thomson Scientific, Inc., 3501 Market St., Philadelphia, PA  19104-2785, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  The NIST Research Library requires an annual subscription to the Web of Science  Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded database.  Web of Science (WoS) Software is a proprietary product of the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI), which was acquired by Thomson Scientific in 1992.  The WoS provides seamless access to current and retrospective multidisciplinary information from approximately 8,700 of the most prestigious, high-impact research journals in the world.  WoS also provides a unique search method, cited reference searching.  This technique adds a unique capability to the WoS database and is also copyrighted and is not available from any other source.  With it, users can navigate forward, backward, and through the literature, searching all disciplines and time spans to uncover all the information relevant to their research.  Users can also navigate to electronic full-text journal articles.  

The WoS is the most heavily used NIST Research Library database with approximately 150,000 searches conducted each year by NIST Research scientists.  The product is a valuable resource that is critical for NIST staff to keep up with the published literature.  It is a core database for scientific research.  NIST is aware of no other product on the market offers the breadth of coverage (more than 6000 scientific, medical, technical and social science journals are indexed) for NIST researchers.  

This acquisition is a renewal for a subscription service to the WoS database that the NIST library has provided NIST scientists and researchers since 1997.  Market research indicates that WoS is the only multidisciplinary database that covers all the sciences in which NIST staff performs research.  In addition to the annual software license renewal, NIST also intends to negotiate a one-time purchase of back years of the WoS from 1900 through 1944.

The sole source determination is based on the need that the existing software is proprietary and can only be obtained from Thomson Scientific, Inc., which appears to be uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement.  NIST intends to award a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Thomson Scientific for a period of five years comprised of a base year and four one-year options.  Interested parties may identify their interest; however, they must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing, no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson, Contract Specialist, at jill.johnson@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) intends to solicit and award multiple indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts for its Resource Efficiency Management Program.  It is the Governments intent to consider awarding a portion of this acquisition under the authority of the Small Business set aside program per FAR Part 19.  As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements of this anticipated request for proposal (RFP).<BR>         <BR>All interested small businesses are requested to respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Governments market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified interested firms is significant enough for a restricted competition as a small business set aside. The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified interested firms is significant enough for a restricted competition under the authority of the 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned procurement programs.  If after review of all responses, the Government determines that there is not enough qualified 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as a small business set aside.  The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms.  Your response is requested no later than 1600 central time 02 September 2008.  Information presented is for market research purposes only.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.<BR><BR>         <BR>Description of the Requirement:  The US Army requires Resource Efficiency Management (REM) services within the United States to improve facility energy efficiency, promote the use of renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to improve other resource efficiency-related requirements.  REM is an innovative management approach (Human Performance Based) that focuses on reducing energy and other resource consumption, saving money, and helping the environment.  The REM program augments existing facility resources and focuses on no- and low- cost opportunities to reduce energy consumption in real time, including behavior aspects of energy end uses and operation and maintenance measures.  Under the REM Program, full-time Resource Efficiency Managers support facilities efforts to reduce energy costs and consumption and meet their mandated energy conservation goals. The objectives of the REM program are to identify and implement readily attained cost saving initiatives in energy, water, and resource conservation.  REM contractor services include, but are not limited to, analysis of energy end uses and distribution systems, identifying opportunities for energy and emission reductions, strengthening energy management programs, conducting awareness training, developing and executing energy projects, providing measurement and verification support, preparing documentation to obtain energy efficiency rebates and incentives, collecting and accumulating consumption data, assembling data in prescribed formats, analysis of the data, providing decision making support information and recommendations in reports and briefings, and responding to related questions on the subject. A unique feature of the program is that REM pays for itself through energy cost savings, rebates and incentives, and verifiable cost avoidance.  It is generally recognized that the cost of the REMs services must be offset annually by the direct and indirect energy cost savings they produce.  This position will be full time located at the Contractors facility unless it is determined that two facilities can share the service in order to justify the position.    <BR>It is anticipated that this contract will consist of one base year and four (4) one year options for a possible total five year contract. The programmatic capacity is expected to be $10 Million.<BR>Interested vendors who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this email with a response to ALL of the questions presented below:<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  The Alaska District Corps of Engineers intends to specify proprietary and/or sole source keyed lock cores by BEST Access Systems and exterior key storage systems by KNOX Company in solicitations for various installation facilities on Fort Wainwright (FWA) and Fort Richardson (FRA) Alaska during fiscal year 2009. THIS NOTICE IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  No solicitation will be available as these sole source items will be incorporated into the specifications for all FY09 solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) facilities on Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson.  Reference FAR 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Directorate of Public Works on both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson require all installation buildings to utilize interchangeable keyed lock cores and exterior key storage boxes from single manufacturers for consistency, compatibility and sustainability across all installed equipment.  Due to the large number of key systems available on the open market, standards and limitations must be established for the use of these systems in order to maintain low initial costs and low future maintenance costs.  The installation of any keyed system that is not in compliance with installation requirements will require either the removal and replacement of that device or replacement of the entire installation key system.  These items will be procured under MILCON construction contracts, outside vendors will not be permitted to install or maintain either of these systems.

<DESC><p>A. INTRODUCTION: <br />The Air Force Information Operations Technology Alliance (IOTA) invites technology demonstration papers addressing innovative concepts in computer-based gaming and simulations in support of training and education in the area of Information Operations (IO). After review of paper submissions, the Government may invite candidates to demonstrate their system during the Fall 2008 Phoenix Challenge Workshop Exhibition, to be held on 29 October 2008 at the Charleston Marriott, 170 Lockwood Blvd, Charleston SC, 29403. This RFI is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals. Contracts awarded based on responses to this RFI are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Gaming/simulation technology demonstration papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to: <br />AFISRA/A7KA<br />ATTN: RFI AFISRA-08-0001<br />102 Hall Boulevard, Ste 210<br />San Antonio, TX 78243-7038<br />Concept papers may be submitted electronically to:
<p>Responses shall reference RFI number AFISRA-08-0001. This announcement is effective<br />18 Aug 08 through 18 Sep 08. Technology demonstration papers may be submitted at any time during the effective period. There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>(1) Background : The Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, Intelligence (OSD(I)) and the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Warfighter Support, Information Operations &amp; Strategic Studies Directorate (ODUSD(WS)/IO&amp;SS) requested the Air Force (AF) through the Air Force Information Operations Center (AFIOC) implement the Information Operations Technology Alliance (IOTA) environment to facilitate the exchange of Information Operations (IO) technologies between academia, government, and industry. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between academia, government, and industry, thus capturing the best of the IO community's thinking on new and emerging IO technologies.</p>
<p>The IOTA initiative is designed to drive innovation for IO by leveraging identification, acquisition, and dissemination of emerging and mature IO technology information within academia, government, and industry. IOTA streamlines, accelerates and improves IO acquisition and development communities in timely development and delivery of new IO solutions with increased capabilities to the warfighter. Phoenix Challenge Conferences are one of the IOTA initiatives.</p>
<p>(2) Workshop: This fall, at OSD's request IOTA plans to hold a workshop to explore the use of computer-based games/simulations as they would apply to entry-level training and education in the area of Information Operations. The workshop will consist of several working groups made up of subject matter experts in the field of gaming, simulations, education, Information Operations, and other fields. A half day exposition of gaming and simulation is included in the agenda. This exposition will allow vendors with expertise in the area of computer-based gaming and simulations to demonstrate their state-of-the-art software and hardware to the members of the working groups.</p>
<p>While the focus of the working group is to explore gaming and simulation for IO training, the vendors need not necessarily focus on IO. It is desired the vendors display/demonstrate mature, state-of-the-art gaming/simulators that best showcase the vendors ability to develop games/simulations designed for training and education.</p>
<p>(3) Security Requirements: The submittal process under this RFI is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage the latest technology advances. Vendors should not submit contract sensitive (proprietary) or classified papers.<br />.<br />(4) Other Special Requirements: (a) DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ONLY TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PAPERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED. (b) Successful offeror's must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132. (c) Offerors are advised that only warranted Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to an award under this RFI.</p>
<p>C. CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>The cost of preparing technology demonstration papers in response to this RFI is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract. Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the paper and any evaluations thereof. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired. Use of diagrams, screen captures, or figures to depict the essence of the proposed demonstration is strongly encouraged. Submitters' technology demonstration papers shall not exceed three (3) pages using Microsoft Word format. The Offeror shall prepare an additional unclassified, non-proprietary title and summary page at the beginning of the document. Technology demonstration papers in excess of three pages will be returned to the Offeror for resubmission in accordance with the page limitations. Multiple concept papers addressing different technology demonstrations may be submitted by each Offeror. However, each technology demonstration paper must address only one demonstration. Those offeror's with technology demonstration papers found to be consistent with the intent of the RFI and of interest to the Government will be ranked in priority order. Those offeror's may be invited to setup and present said demonstration during the Fall 2008 Phoenix Challenge Workshop, 29 October 2008 at the Charleston Marriott Hotel. The Technology demonstration paper shall be formatted as follows:</p>
<p>Section A: Title, Offeror, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone #, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address, years of expertise in the field of computer-based gaming/simulations</p>
<p>Section B: Gaming/Simulation Description--What is the innovative, mature, state-of-the-art computer-based game/simulation software/hardware you are proposing to demonstrate?</p>
<p>1. Technology (Game/Simulation) name: <br />2. Technology owner: <br />3. Technology creator: <br />4. Intended audience (who the technology was originally created for): <br />5. Intended purpose (why the technology was originally created; e.g., fun, training, education, online or computer job aid, etc.):</p>
<p>Section C: Technology Demonstration--How do you envision execution of the Technology demonstration? What is the proposed demonstration methodology?</p>
<p>Section D: Operational Impact--How will the product of the demonstration enhance entry-level training and education?</p>
<p>Section E: Support Components--What additional things are required for the demonstration including hardware, software, data, facilities, and training?</p>
<p>Section F: Please note related contracts to include the point of contact's current telephone # and address.</p>
<p>D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO EXHIBIT:</p>
<p>Selection of a vendor to exhibit will be based on the extent to which the technology/game/simulation possesses the following Structural Gaming Elements:</p>
<p>1. Technical maturity<br />2. Breadth of application<br />3. Relevance of or adaptability to training/education<br />4. Representative of vendor's ability to develop games to meet customer requirements</p>
<p>E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number. The IOTA will include non-government advisors in the evaluation of concept papers and proposals. The IOTA team includes the MITRE Corporation, a non-profit Federally Funded Research and Development Center for the Department of Defense, will assist the Government in the evaluation of concepts and proposals. Additionally, Booz Allen Hamilton, ManTech, Trinity Tech, and Dynetics will be supporting IOTA during the review of the technology demonstration papers and the conduct of the fall working group.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent of The Louis Stokes Cleveland, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44141 to negotiate sole source with BioAnalytical Systems Inc., a small business, for the Culex blood collection system.  The Culex  blood collection system is used with small laboratory animals and performs automated dosing, blood collection, and micro dialysis.  The system comes complete with a mobile cart which holds the blood collection unit, fraction collectors, a rat-turn, and an on board PC.  This system also comes with proprietary software that operates the entire system. The VA Medical Center currently owns the Rat-turn, fraction collector, and other chromatography equipment manufactured by BioAnalytical Systems Inc. The proprietary software supplied by the Culex system will enable all of the supplied equipment along with the equipment the VA Medical Center currently owns to operate as one system. The software will operate the timing of each component and when certain functions will take place. This software will also generate reports automatically on the subject being tested.  The government believes that only one business can satisfy the agency requirements and intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by August 25, 2008. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. No solicitation is available at this time.  All inquiries must be submitted via email to Shaun McWeeny, Contract Specialist at shaun.mcweeny@va.gov by no later then August 25, 2008 @ 12:00 P.M.

However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This purchase request is for a Datex-Ohmeda Patient Monitoting System.  These units will be used in the Maternal Newborn Ward of the Naval Hospital in Rota, Spain.  The Navy has identified this Datex-Ohmeda infant warmer as a direct replacement of the equipment currently in use at the facility.  The existing equipment is outdated and past its life expectancy.  Using these new warmers maintain the standard of care and reduce the training down-time of the staff.  The Datex-Ohmeda infant warmers provide unparalleled flexibility and capabilities for the maternal ward.  This includes the ability to monitor the temperature of infants and weigh them without having to move them to a separate scale.  Onboard oxygen blender reduces the need for extra O2 tanks in the room.  In addition, the small size and mobility of the warmer combined with the above stated capabilities allows for the infant to be treated at the bedside.  This ability promotes the Family Center Care that the Naval Hospital has established as the standard of care for the maternal ward.  The Statutory authority for this sole source purchase is Title 10 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented in the FAR 6.302-1(a) (2).

Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information in response to this notice via email to the address listed below, no later than August 25, 2008 at 3:00 PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is entirely in the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to issue a sole source award to Experimental Pathology Laboratory.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  CFSAN Pathology (hereafter referred to as PATHOLOGY in this document) of the Senior Science and Policy Staff (SSPS), Office of Food Additive Safety (OFAS), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) evaluates complex pathology data submitted in support of food and color additive petitions, provides pathology support to toxicological experiments utilizing laboratory animals and provides histopathological slide interpretations when requested. 

When the PATHOLOGY offices and laboratory moved to College Park, along with other CFSAN offices in 2002, no space was provided at the College Park site to accommodate the PATHOLOGY Archives.  Therefore, the Pathology Archive materials needed to be contracted out to an off-site location. In the spring of 2003, the archiving needs that pertained to specimens and files of the PATHOLOGY Archives were added to the PATHOLOGY service contract needs as the previous PATHOLOGY service contract was re-competed in full and open competition and awarded to Experimental Pathology Laboratories (EPL) under Contract No. 223-03-2480.

In the summer of 2003, a contract modification was necessary in order to accommodate the archiving of radioactive and non-radioactive samples as well as samples that needed to be retained refrigerated or frozen (temperature sensitive) for the Office of Cosmetics and Colors.

Therefore PATHOLOGY relies today exclusively on Experimental Pathology Laboratory services contract for technical support of any kind. In addition the archiving needs of PATHOLOGY have expanded in volume and complexity as mentioned above, accommodating Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) required needs for other CFSAN program offices or FDA Centers such as the storage of radioactive and frozen samples mentioned above. This contract enabled the small staff of pathologists within CFSAN PATHOLOGY to continue to provide CFSANs program offices / other FDA Centers the needed pathology support and fulfill other pathology related functions effectively.

      Moving samples out of the archive and set-up in new facility would be:
1.	cost and time extensive to the 
2.	the cost may outweigh actual worth of the samples and
3.	jeopardize the intrinsic worth the samples hold as shared resource to other FDA Centers who do not have Pathology unit additionally, the samples may be lost or damaged during the moving process

The vendor has worked extensively in these areas and thus possesses an understanding of the procedures, problems and timeliness aspect to these projects.  Having the same vendor continue to do this will ensure that critical work is not interrupted and is completed in a manner that furthers the mission of FDA.  The proposed source is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  This action is proposed on a sole source basis because it is a follow-on contract where the vendor has developed procedures that help expedite critical requests and there being a substantial duplication of cost to the government.  The proposed award is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than 5 days of this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contracts based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this notice must be sent via email to Kimberly.davis@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.

Responses to this notice shall be received no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time, Thursday, August 21, 2008. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase:<BR><BR>1. This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an advertising package for the New Hampshire Army National Guard 2008 Road Tour purchased through NH Radio Network (Nassau Broadcasting), requested by the Recruiting Division of the New Hampshire Army National Guard for performance period 22 August 2008 through 31 July 2009.<BR><BR>2. This package, developed by the NH Radio Network delivers radio advertising and participation at targeted events for the NHARNG to attend with NH Radio Network focusing on the initiatives on Retention and Recruitment:  These events include, but are not limited to, Military Appreciation Events, hunting and fishing expos, signage opportunities at State Fairs and booth space available at the State Fairs throughout New Hampshire to set up demonstrations in an effort to increase awareness in the NHARNG in an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in the NHARNG. <BR><BR>4. Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <BR><BR>5. The NH Radio Network is the only organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media throughout the State of New Hampshire of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the New Hampshire Army National Guard wishes to enlist. <BR><BR>6. Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the New Hampshire Radio Network is the only vendor capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the New Hampshire Army National Guard wishes to enlist.<BR><BR>7. Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541840 Media Advertising in New Hampshire who were also registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  It is therefore determined that NH Radio Network (Nassau Broadcasting) is the only responsible source available who can provide an advertising package of this type.<BR><BR>8.

Market research conducted by the Government has determined that WaferGen Biosystems, is the only source capable of providing the micro-incubation system, which enables a large range of experimental studies, which requires image based and time course monitoring of living biological samples (i.e. p02, pC02, temperature, medium replenishment). The light imaging section has devices which provide for maintenance of temperature and gases over living cells cultured on glass, and they are limited in that they are not intended for long term culture of samples or perfusion, rather than only environmental control during imaging. Several commercial devices exist with similar capabilities, but none that provide the combination of feature in the WaferGen unit. Specifications: (1) Part Number: SmartSlide 200 Micro-Incubation with Perfusion WFS200; is composed of a control unit and any number of multiwall culture plates (currently 6 well plate format, with soon to be 24 well option). The control unit regulates the environment in up to six culture plates simultaneously. The plates are considered disposable. Connection of plates to the control unit can be swapped so that any number of plates can be maintained in an incubator. The plate base and lid are made of glass, and are compatible with the cell patterning technologies. (2) Part Number: WFSS6M1 x 10 Case Qty, SmartSlide Incubator.   
          							
This notice does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP) and submission of any information provided in response to this announcement is purely voluntary, and the Government assumes no financial responsibility for nor costs incurred.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all responses received within (10) days after publication will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS) intends to modify an existing contract (DG133E-06-SE-5750) with the University of Texas - Austin to extend services for continued research in coral-based climate studies for the period commencing from time of award through August 31, 2009. This study involves using massive corals in the Caribbean sector of the tropical Atlantic Ocean for geochemical analysis. Coral samples will be removed from the skeleton and analyzed for the stable O and C isotopic composition as well as Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios. It is a collaborative effort between scientists at the University Nova Southeastern University (NSU), University of Miami RSMAS, USGS and University of South Florida (USF). In 2006, Dr. Quinn moved to the University of Texas at Austin (UT). In 2008, Dr. Halley retired from the USGS. The standard working arrangement has Dr. Dodge (NSU) focusing his efforts on studies of coral skeletal density, whereas Drs. Swart (RSMAS) and Quinn (UT) focus their efforts on studies of coral geochemistry. Geochemical analyses will be performed in the laboratories of Drs. Swart and Quinn. The previous USF phases of this study focused on generating proxy climate records from coral skeletons from the Florida Keys (Looe Key and Dry Tortugas) and Puerto Rico (La Perguera). The Looe Key and Dry Tortugas work is completed. A new suite of coral cores were recovered from La Parguera, Puerto Rico, last summer and these new cores formed the basis of the Ph.D. studies of Hali Kilbourne. All of this previous work has focused in the coral Montastraea spp., but recent work has begun to explore the coral Siderastraea spp. for its potential as a climate recorder (Maupin, 2008, MS thesis; Maupin, Quinn and Halley, in review). The UT portion of this year's study will include stable isotopic and elemental ratio determinations on a subset of corals samples from the Dry Tortugas. <br />This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100k) NAICS code 541710. This is not a request for a competitive proposal. It is a notice of intent to modify an existing contract for continued research.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS) intends to modify an existing contract (DG133E-05-SE-5025) with the University of Nova Southeastern University to extend services for continued research in coral-based climate studies for the period commencing from time of award through July 31, 2009. This study involves coring and coral growth analyses of coral cores and geochemical analysis of 300-year old coral record. The overall aim of this work is to demonstrate: 1) multiple corals are capable of recording a common growth response to stress over a background of natural variability; 2) growth response of southeast Florida corals correlates to environmental stress conditions determined from geochemical proxies; 3) detailed geochemical analyses can help to confirm the correlation between growth rate and environmental stressor; and 4) correlation between growth and environment can be used to assess multi-century growth records for prior occurrence and frequency. This research is a collaborative effort between Dr. Peter Swart (University of Miami RSMAS) and Dr. Richard Dodge (Nova Southeastern University).<br />This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100k) NAICS code 541710. This is not a request for a competitive proposal. It is a notice of intent to modify an existing contract for continued research.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 08-PGS-01 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is unrestricted and the NAICS is 325413.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to procure on a sole source basis assays that determine blood cytokine levels and other analytes using the Searchlight Array Chemiluminescent system. From Thermo Scientific, 35A Cabot Road, Woburn, MA 01801 under the authority of FAR 6.302 1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements



The Livestock Issues Research Unit has worked with Thermo Scientific/Pierce Endogen to develop assays that determine blood cytokine levels and other analytes using the Searchlight Array Chimiluminescent system.  Thermo Scientific Searchlight Protein Array technology is a multiplexing sandwich-ELISA system based on chemiluminescent or fluorescent detection of analytes whose respective capture-antibodies are spotted in arrays within each well of a 96-well microplate.  As many as 16 analytes (4X4 array in each well) can be measured per well, meaning that 16 cytokines or other biomarkers can be assayed simultaneously with each 50 ul sample.  The custom assays are prepared so they are easy for the end user to follow and take as little as 3 hours to acquire data for over 6 analytes on 40 samples.  The imagine equipment and software has been custom developed specifically for Searchlight Chemiluminescent Arrays and switching arrays would introduce variation into our laboratories methodologies, resulting in poor quality data and variation between studies.

Description of Supplies/Services:



The purchase is for the following reagents from Roche Applied Science:

26 EA Searchlight Multiplex Array, Custom Bovine 4 plex, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, & TNF-Alpha, Thermo Scientific #84933

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
This workload is currently part of the BRAC migration.  The work has historically been performed by TSO Pensacola, and most of the workload has recently migrated to TSO Indianapolis.  Currently WinRunner/LoadRunner/TestDirector (and their add-ins) form the existing baseline of licenses used by TSOs Indianapolis and Pensacola for functional and regression testing of multiple applications that are constantly evolving and are required to work in diverse environments.  WinRunner fully integrates with LoadRunner for load testing and TestDirector for global test management.  DFAS TSO Pensacola has invested in Mercury licenses for over a period of years, and TSO Indianapolis has migrated this workload using these products, and TSO Pensacola continues to use it for the remaining workload to be migrated for BRAC.  No other software has been tested using the DFAS configuration and environment which creates risk for the Government and its investment for the initial license costs and continued support costs over the years.  Another potential risk is reduced testing services and support to our internal and external customers as we may not be able to sustain performance at the current level using other products.

When considering the purchase of a replacement product, we must also consider the cost of re-working test scripts for multiple systems plus the costs for re-training analysts and testers to become proficient in the use of another test tool suite.  Procuring an alternative product instead of renewing the license support and maintenance for the current product would result in substantial duplication of costs, and it is not likely to be recovered through competition among other products. Continuation of maintenance support for WinRunner/Load Runner/Test Director licenses previously purchased, implemented and being used by DFAS users is considered to be a logical follow-on. WinRunner appears on the DFAS Standard Products List for Windows automated testing.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, Subpart 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number FDA-SOL-08-00820 for full and open competition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-26. 
     
This intent of this synopsis/solicitation is for the  acquisition of a barcode scanner system, training, maintenance and system integration.  The Contractor shall develop a barcode scanner system to streamline and automate the Office of Criminal Investigations seized assets/evidence and property tracking system, to improve the overall handling, security, and management of law enforcement sensitive property.  

The Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) , FDA, Rockville MD, has a requirement for 35 Portable Handheld Barcode Scanners, 12 Cabled Handheld Barcode Scanners, 35 Barcode Printers, Training, Integration of System and Maintenance.

Objectives

The basic objective is to acquire a barcode scanner system to streamline and improve an outdated seized asset/evidence and property tracking system, utilizing a barcode technology to facilitate the collection, management, transfer/movement, storage, and disposition of property.  The specific objectives of the project are to:

 Identify a barcode system that will provide a means to electronically track seized assets to replace the OCI3400, Certified Inventory of Evidence (CIE) and to replace form HHS-22 for tracking property
 Integrate the barcode technology into the OCI Automated Investigative Management System (AIMS) Oracle 10g database system. (I.e. currently, all evidence related data is manually entered into our AIMS system.  OCI needs to be able to import data (including images) into our AIMS system from the barcoding system. Therefore, the barcoding system must be able to export data into CSV (comma separated values) format so that an AIMS import process (to be developed by OCI personnel) can import data periodically.  Exact specifications of the exported CSV data will be defined by OCI and vendor.
 Design a system that will be utilized nationwide in remote locations on search warrant sites to log seized assets/evidence, barcode, and generate forms/reports remotely.
 Customize a solution allowing OCI the capabilities to enhance or expand the barcoding software. OCI administrator should be able to add custom fields (textboxes, list boxes, and checkboxes) and hide un-used fields without any additional development / programming costs.   The software should be flexible enough to allow user-defined fields in addition to the out-of-the-box fields.


Technical Requirements 

1. The technical requirements for the barcode system are:

 Electronically collect data and images in remote locations 
 Generate a Certified Inventory of Evidence (CIE) form with a unique numbering system  printable using standard letter size paper and signature blocks
 Electronically transmit documents using internet/intranet communications including but not limited to VPN technology 
 Create barcode labels to affix to assets/property
 Document chain of custody using a tamper-proof time/date stamp technology - track unlimited moves of sensitive law enforcement assets/property
 Digitized/electronic signature technology with password protection for access control
 Ability to produce ad-hoc and standard reports  printable using standard letter or legal paper
 Integrate into the OCI Oracle 10g AIMS system
 Develop an automated procedure for asset/evidence and property inventory purposes
 Data entry will be handled utilizing laptop computers for remote locations and desktop computers for office use. (Windows XP Professional is the operating system used by OCI)

Seized assets/evidence - the system will generate a list of seized property and create barcode labels reflecting the designated seizure/unique CIE number for the property seized.  These labels will be affixed to the property at the seizing site or when property received.  The system will generate detailed forms and reports for tracking evidence, provide printable detailed reports and chain of custody form on site when evidence is seized and/or property is received.      

The system scanner will read labels for inventory purposes and generate reports based on various requirements (date range, case numbers, etc.) 

Data captured in the barcode system will be exported in to the FDA/OCI Oracle 10g database known as AIMS.  The contractor will work with OCI to provide a solution to export data from one system to another.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(ii)
(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --
(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(3) It is the only proposal received.
(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) Contract award.
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

(2) The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the Contracting Officer after consultation with the offeror; and

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

2.	The system shall be equipped with a resistivity indicator and have an alarm light that turns on when resistivity falls below a set point.

3.	The total organic carbon (TOC) of the processed water shall be less than 300 parts per billion.  Lower TOC adds value.

4.	The system shall produce a minimum of 100 gallons per hour.  Greater production adds value.

<DESC><p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation&nbsp;(RFQ). Submit written proposals on the referenced RFQ Number - RA1341-08-RQ-0178</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is a Total Small Business Set-Aside and the associated NAICS code is 333295. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) Contract Line items and system requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish 1 - High Rate Silicon Deep Reactive Ion Etcher. The System shall meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein.</p>
<p>Option 1 - CLIN 0002 - Laser interferometric endpoint monitor - this method will be used for monitoring and stopping the etching process when the etch reaches a material of differing reflectivity such as a buried oxide film, backside metal, or backside dielectric film. The proposal shall describe the hardware and software to be included with this option as well as indicate the size of the monitored laser spot and describe the means for positioning the laser beam onto the wafer. The proposal shall indicate how the equipment is integrated into the system.</p>
<p>Option 2 - CLIN 0003 - Complete parts set to switch to 6" wafer handling (including parts for load lock and electrostatic chuck).</p>
<p>(VI) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory Division - Quantum Electrical Metrology Division located in Boulder, Colorado, USA, requires an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching system for research and development and for single wafer processing of 100 mm and 150 mm wafers.</p>
<p>The system should be a current production model, not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. There must be at least 5 working units of the proposed make and model operating currently in the field. Any substitutions of normally used major system components, such as software, power-supplies, load-lock mechanisms, vacuum valves, gauges and pumping equipment required to meet these specification shall be clearly noted in the specification.</p>
<p>All equipment, excluding the rough vacuum pump, shall be Class 100 clean-room compatible, designed to sit entirely within the clean room. All clean-room equipment shall be housed entirely within a 1.5 meter by 2.2 meter (5 by 7 foot) footprint, including hook-ups to house facilities, such as gas line connections and vacuum lines, which will pass through the wall of the clean room. The system shall be wired for 208 VAC service.</p>
<p>The system shall meet OSHA standards for operator safety and SEMI standards for environmental safety. The system shall be equipped with an easily accessible emergency shut-off switch which when activated safely turns off any ongoing process without causing damage to a sample in process during the shut-down procedure.</p>
<p>1.0. HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>1.1. General (Line Item 0001 - High Rate Silicon Deep Reactive Ion Etcher)</p>
<p>The system shall be inherently designed for very high rate (&gt;25 &micro;m/minute), high aspect-ratio anisotropic etching of silicon with sidewall protection and minimal sidewall angle.</p>
<p>The system shall be capable of through-the-wafer etching of up to 500 micrometer (&micro;m) thick wafers, shall have a high degree of etching selectivity over silicon dioxide and photoresist. It must be capable of operating using the etching process commonly known as the Bosch process and the Contractor must be licensed to provide users with this process and any other patented process techniques required to achieve the process specifications.</p>
<p>The system shall be equipped with a low frequency, pulsed-platen rf generator and recipe control for etching SOI wafers without footing. The system shall be engineered to reduce sidewall tilt across 100-150 mm wafer diameters while etching at high rates. Major components of the system shall be off-the-shelf, readily available parts, not custom-made. The system shall be delivered with high aspect etching processes that meet the specifications outlined below.</p>
<p>The system offered shall have a demonstrated 95% up-time. Down time shall be calculated from the time the equipment fails to function properly to the time it is repaired and recovers normal functions.</p>
<p>1.2. Pumping / Gas Handling</p>
<p>The system shall contain a high-throughput high vacuum pumping system as required to perform the necessary processes with high etch rates. All pumps shall be dry pumps (oil free). The vacuum shall be sufficient to maintain process stability and repeatability from wafer to wafer and run to run. The roughing pump(s) shall be sized appropriately to deliver the required pumping speed to maintain high vacuum and to evacuate vacuum chamber and load-lock. All pumps shall be rated for long up-time operation with the effluent expected in the proposed plasma etch processes. The system shall have appropriate vacuum gauges and displays for measuring both high (ion or cold-cathode gauge) and process (capacitance manometer) vacuum regions. Additional gauges for monitoring the load-lock and roughing lines shall also be provided. The gas manifold shall be constructed of all orbital-welded, stainless steel, with VCR fittings on all process gas lines.</p>
<p>The system shall include mass flow controllers of sufficient quantity and flow rate to operate the proposed process and shall include at least 2 additional mass flow controllers plumbed into the gas manifold, equipped with VCR fittings and capped off, and controllable by the computer control system through the computer software for future recipe development. Additionally, the system shall provide a means to rapidly switch from one flow recipe to another as required by the Bosch process. The System shall provide active control of process gas pressure as well as flow.</p>
<p>1.3. Process Chamber and Load Lock</p>
<p>The system shall be equipped with a manually loaded, automated wafer delivery loadlock. The load lock shall be capable of loading or unloading the wafer from/to the atmosphere load station to/from the process chuck in less than 5 minutes. The load lock shall be capable of handling both single-side and double-side polished wafers of varying thicknesses (50 &micro;m to 5 mm). The operation of the load lock should not be affected by dielectric or metallic films deposited on either side of the wafer.</p>
<p>The system shall be delivered equipped to handle one 100 mm (4 inch) wafer. Additionally the system (load-lock and process chamber) shall be capable of being adapted to accommodate 150 mm wafers (see section 4, Options, below). Changes of wafer size shall be able to be performed within a maximum 8 hours of installation time with the optional future purchase of the necessary components.</p>
<p>Wafer cooling shall be provided by the process chamber chuck to maintain the proper temperature necessary to ensure optimization of etching parameters, etching repeatability, wafer uniformity, and process stability from wafer-to-wafer. The process chuck shall be capable of providing cooling in excess of that normally required to etch a single wafer in the event that partial wafers or chips are etched by being attached to backing wafers (which might cause additional thermal resistance). The wafer chuck shall use electrostatic clamping as a means of securing the wafer and containing the helium gas used for heat conduction to the cold bath. The electrostatic chuck dielectric and power supply shall be capable of providing uniform clamping force on silicon wafers (bare as well as oxidized) as well as wafers backed with tape or thick dielectric substrates (quartz or sapphire). The chuck temperature shall be controllable over the range of temperatures needed for the proposed process (-20 &deg;C to +40 &deg;C). The system shall provide an indication of improper chuck operation (for example, loss of He backside pressure or excess He flow). Proposals shall state the temperature profile achievable across the 100 and 150 mm wafer surface under high rate etch conditions. Plasma cleaning of the electrostatic chuck surface shall be possible to eliminate contamination that might interfere with wafer clamping. A chiller shall be provided as part of the system.</p>
<p>The proposal shall describe the size of any regions that suffer from non-uniformity due to clamping. It shall be possible to electrostatically clamp and etch 3" wafers or wafer fragments by waxing (or other bonding techniques) to a 100 mm backing wafer. The backing wafer may be silicon, quartz, sapphire or other dielectrics.</p>
<p>The system shall be designed for easy internal cleaning. It is well known that exposing certain materials to the plasma in the Bosch process can have unpredictable results, often requiring mechanical cleaning of interior process chamber components in order to return the system to its original working condition. It is very important that the system can be completely cleaned in a short time in order to allow us to schedule our work efficiently. The proposal shall describe cleaning methods to be used and give an estimate of the time necessary to clean the system.</p>
<p>The system shall be compatible with the optional or later addition of endpoint monitoring equipment (see section 1.5, optional equipment, below). This includes appropriate optical feedthrough for the laser interferometric endpoint system. The system shall contain RF/DC process power supplies as required to deliver the appropriate plasma processing environment.</p>
<p>1.4. Control Systems</p>
<p>Interlocks and/or system feedback circuits and sensors shall be provided to ensure proper and safe shut-down of the system and halting of any ongoing process in the event of failures including but not limited to: cooling water loss, high/low pressure, abnormal gas flow rates (e.g. loss of any process gas flow), and high reflected RF power. The equipment shall be inherently designed for safe recovery from a power outage during operations or while in the stand-by mode.</p>
<p>It is required that the PC provides active logging of all processes run in the system. The system shall be equipped with a PC interface and Windows-based computer controlled software. Software shall be designed with clear, intuitive block diagrams of major system schematics. The system shall have the ability to enter and run new process recipes. Process recipe control shall include dynamic control of all aspects of the process including parameter switching and parameter ramping. Process logging shall include all relevant parameters.</p>
<p>The PC shall be equipped with a means of backing up and restoring process recipes and system software. The system shall meet OSHA standards for operator safety and SEMI standards for environmental safety. The system shall be equipped with an easily accessible emergency, red in color, mushroom button shut-off switch which when activated safely turns off any ongoing process and places all process gas valves to their normally-off positions without causing damage to a sample in process during the shut-down procedure.</p>
<p>2.0. PROCESS AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The Proposal shall include description of processes capable of obtaining the following specifications as well as data demonstrating the following performance abilities. The proposal shall include chamber/electrode design and software control features that help describe how the specifications will be met.</p>

<p>2.5. Chamber, gas flow, RF power and all other process parameters shall be stable and capable of providing reproducible results from wafer to wafer, run to run, and process to process, without the necessity for lengthy conditioning procedures. (i.e., all of the above etch uniformity parameters shall be repeatable within the boundary values given above regardless of number of wafers processed, or previous chamber history.)</p>
<p>2.6. The system and inherent processes required to provide the functions above, shall utilize gases with fluorine-based chemistries only. Chlorine gases, combustible gases, or corrosive process gases are unacceptable.</p>

This report shall provide a brief summary of the activities performed and it will indicate progress against the timeline provided in the Project Plan.  Any issues that could adversely affect the schedule should be identified for resolution. The Contractor is responsible for submitting a hardcopy and an electronic version (sent via e-mail) of the progress reports to the EAC Project Manager. Every two weeks, this report should also include the following information:

Military Mobile Force Protection Training

A. REQUEST FOR QUOTATION UNDER GSA CONTRACT SCHEDULE:  
Contractors shall ensure that the service provided is properly included under the GSA contract vehicle proposed.  The first review will determine if the schedule proposed is applicable to the service requested.  If it is not, the quote will be removed from consideration.

B.  REQUIREMENT: The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Fort Bragg, North Carolina has a requirement for Military Mobile Force Protection Training (MMFPT).  The contractor shall provide all direct labor, training material, supervision (of contractor personnel), facilities, and all other items and services (not specifically identified herein to be Government furnished), necessary to conduct a minimum 5 day course on Military Mobile Force Protection Training (MMFPT).  This training shall encompass instructions on antiterrorism/force protection concerns as described throughout the Statement of Requirement.  MMFPT shall be conducted for Government designees (hereafter to be referred to as students) from the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), 4th Psychological Operations Group (POG), Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

C.  DELIVERY ORDERS:  The Government intends to establish a firm-fixed price single award to the offeror submitting a quote that is determined the Best Value to the Government.

D.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Period of Performance of August, September, and October 2008.

E.  EVALUATION: Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to this Request for Quotation and is the Best Value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the 3 evaluation factors:  (1) Technical, (2) Price, and (3) Past Performance, which are listed in descending order of importance.

1.Technical Capability

(a) Technical Approach  The accuracy and extend to which the offer demonstrates a complete understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Requirement (SOR) and conveys methodologies, techniques, and a detailed technical approach that enhances the likelihood of satisfactory performance and performance quality.

(b) Training Evaluation  Each vendors proposal shall include their knowledge and past experience in training relevant to this requirement.  Contractors shall submit a detailed Program of Instruction (POI) defining how they will accomplish the training as specified in the Statement of Requirement.  At a minimum include detailed sketches, diagrams, and breakdown of facilities.  If the contractor proposes the use of a military range to support the requirement, it will be the contractors responsibility to schedule that facility and to ensure its availability at the time of and throughout, the training period.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide, with his proposal, a memo or other similar documentation from an authorized Government representative clearly supporting the use of the range throughout this contract period.  Contractors technical proposal shall include the availability of training dates and the number of training slots available for the months of Aug, Sep, and Oct 2008. 

2. Price:  Overall total price will be evaluated based on adequate price competition for fairness and reasonableness.  Price shall include a firm-fixed price for the performance period.  The Per Student price proposal shall include lodging and three meals a day.  The location of the training site will be evaluated to determine the best value to the Government based on the travel cost to the training area from Fort Bragg, NC.  The contractor shall provide the actual training location.

No alternate offers are authorized.  The Government intends to award an order without discussion.  Therefore, offerors are warned to consult with the Contracting Officer before submitting an offer that takes exception to any term or condition of this RFQ.   However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and to permit offerors to revise their offerors.

Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors:  Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Technical Capability is more important than the Price; however, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the price proposed.  The relative influence that Non-price factors and price will have on the source selection will depend on the marginal differences among the offerors (see Source Selection Decision below).

Source Selection Decision:  In evaluating offers, the Government will make appropriate tradeoffs when required and select the offeror that is most advantageous to the Government.  Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror.

3. Past Performance:  Past performance is a measure to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offerors customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offerors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information.  The Government will not evaluate an offerors organizational past performance on the basis of personal past performance of the offerors key personnel.  Offers shall provide name, title and phone number of principal on a minimum of three contracts for similar services performed during the previous 3 years.  To be technically acceptable, the submitting offeror must submit relevant and current past performance in training in all areas noted in the statement of requirement.  The Government will evaluate each offerors experience on the basis of its depth and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract.

F. SERVICE CONTRACT ACT.  The Service Contract Act is applicable to the resulting Task Order.  If FAR 52.222-41 and a Wage Determination that is appropriate for this location are not contained in your basic GSA contract, please advise this office with your quote.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program


It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 


Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 


Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDAs capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.  The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDAs capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Operations Liaison Unit (OLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.

	Deploy with DoD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
	Provide reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OLU Team Leader and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

SOW paragraph C.3.4 calls for clear working area height to be not less than 11 feet. Because of transportation restrictions on height, would a shorter height be acceptable ? <BR>a. If so, what would be the minimum acceptable height be ? <BR><BR>A: The 11 foot height is desired for test item clearance and adequate solar source distribution.  An 11 foot chamber height is believed to permit transportation of an assembled chamber without on site fabrication requirements.

SOW paragraph C.3.4.7  can the chamber work lights extended into the<BR>clear working area Height?<BR><BR>A: Yes, the SOW section C.3.4.7 chamber work lights are excluded from the C.3.4 clear working area. The lights can extend into the chamber dimension.<BR><BR><BR>Q# 3. SOW paragraph C.3.15.5  Does the Government have a preferred<BR>manufacturer / model for the Spectroradiometer? <BR><BR>A: No, there are several equipment manufacturers that can support the requirement. The desire is an accurate standalone instrument(s) that have a traceable calibration. <BR><BR>Corrections/Additions to the SOW<BR>1. Paragraph C.3.10 Additional section C.3.10 text is below for clarification of chamber control objectives.<BR><BR>The objective for the chamber temperature, solar, and humidity control loops are to provide a visual, paperless, graphics interface that simultaneously displays the individual control cycle, and provides storage of the control measurements and configuration parameters. The existing test facility includes backup data storage instrumentation, however the contractor shall provide a complete control system for operation of the chamber. <BR><BR>2.

There is no need to trench, the camera will be attached to the facility.  There is conduit present In the area of camera 11; however, the contractor must contact the Travis AFB Civil Engineers to determine if they can use the conduit.  If not, new conduit will need to be installed.

This training provides participants the practical skills necessary to recognize, avoid, and respond to potential threats from terrorist organizations. This mission requires the use of pyrotechnics to replicate real world terrorist attacks that train State Department agents deploying to remote high risk location throughout the world.It is requested that the ECU procures the pyrotechnic devices from M.P. Associates as M.P. Associates is the only company who produces the items utilized in our training scenarios.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency to satisfy agency requirements.These pyrotechnic devices provide as close to realistic high threat situation as possible with minimal exposure of risk to the trainee. These pyrotechnic devices are essential to meet the mission requirements of the Explosives Countermeasures Unit.The Explosives Countermeasures Unit has conducted extensive research to identify additional vendors who might be able to satisfy the equipment requirements. Two other vendors; Firfox Pyrotechnics (208) 237 1976 and Lunatec Pyro Pac (256) 725 4224 were consulted as to the availability with negative results.The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previously accepted and approved purchases for similar items that had been competitively bid and awarded.The Bureau expects to fully compete any new requirement that will include installations the Metropolitan Washington, DC area and the 8 DS Field Offices nationwide.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This requirement is amended to added the following questions and answers:

Q: LaCie drives meet and/or exceed the specs for the OWC drives 

A:  The LaCie web site shows a 'rugged hard disk' but it doesn't come in the 1TB capacity.  The LaCie 'rugged hard disk' lacks the eSATA port.  The LaCie QuadraPort model illustrated in the offer from Alliance Micro is not the LaCie 'rugged hard disk'.


Q: Are the hard drives required to be one piece, or can they be regular internal hard drives inserted into external enclosures? 

A:  Yes, the hard drive mechanism is the same product as an internal hard drive.  However, the drive must be in cases that are ruggedized and durable, have quad port interfaces, a positive on/off switch, and meet all the specifications published in FEDBIZOPPS solicitation HM1571-08-T-0018 to create an external storage device for NGA's use.  


All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions and to extend the due date for quotes.

(1)   The following responses are provided to technical questions submitted:

QUESTION:  Do you require any specific finish on the inside?

ANSWER:  There are no requirements for the finish on the inside of the ball.

QUESTION:  Are the posts drilled through to the inside of the balls?

ANSWER:  The requirement for the connection between the post and the ball is that the connection be designed so that under twice the weight of the ball, it will not shear off, bend, and it is fixed - i.e. there is no movement between the post and ball.  The post is permanently attached to the ball.

<SOLNBR>SB1341-08-RQ-0461
<RESPDATE>073008
<CONTACT>Paula A. Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to answer questions posed by potential quoters.
Question 1:  
a.	What type of Aramid fiber is being called out specifically (Nomex, Kevlar, Twaron, etc.)?  Also note that there are several different types of each of these fibers (assuming Kevlar:  K29, K49, K100, etc.).  
Answer:  We are looking for a ballistic grade polyaramid.  Based on my knowledge of the marketplace, either Kevlar or Twaron would be acceptable, but Nomex would not be acceptable because it doesnt have the ballistic resistant properties commonly used in body armor.
b.	Also note that there are several different types of weaves and weights for these fibers (assuming K29: Satin Weave, Basket Weave, 24 oz, etc.).
Answer:  We have previously done work with plain weave Kevlar 129, but it is not our intention to limit this procurement to one particular fiber or weave.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
Question 2:  When speaking of laminated fibers, are they laminated together for a thicker, more rigid laminate, or are they left separated for flexibility?
Answer:  We have previously done work with both 2 and 4 ply laminates, but it is not our intent to limit this procurement to one particular fabric.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date, remain unchanged.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 28 (twenty-eight) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, August 28, 2008.

For this competitive, best value (lowest price, technically acceptable), total small business set aside procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
- 	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
- 	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, August 28, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses no later than the deadline of 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 20, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101. The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS THE FOLLOWING:

1. Change the NAICS code from 541690 to 813920.

2. Add updated Backround information 

3. Update the solicitation release date to August 19,2008. 

THE ANNOUCEMENT IS NOW CHANGED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for the following: 

A. BACKROUND

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) is a not-for-profit organization representing more than 5,400 surgeons, researchers, and other health professionals worldwide who are performing heart, lung, esophageal, and other surgical procedures for the chest. The mission of STS is to enhance the ability of cardiothoracic surgeons to provide the highest quality patient care through education, research, and advocacy.  The STS offers outcome programs in the areas of Adult Cardiac, General Thoracic and Congenital Heart-defect surgery. 

The STS National Database is a comprehensive national registry that collects information from over 600 participating hospitals on patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Since 2003, the Registry collected information on over 1,800,000 procedures. It is a confidential, voluntary, and national in scope. As an independent source of information on patients undergoing cardio-thoracic surgeries, this registry is superior to manufacturer initiated studies (both FDA mandated and voluntary).  

The analytical support for the STS National database is conducted by the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI).  Since 1994, there have been over 50 of publications in peer-reviewed journals resulting from the studies conducted through this Registry.   The FDA in mid-1990s very successfully studied Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR) devices in using the data from the STS registry to obtain valuable information that supplemented FDA postmarket surveillance programs.  

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrative claims data. contain long-term patient information that includes hospital admissions, admission diagnoses, and other information that can be used to determine clinical events over time. 

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) would like to collaborate with the STS in studying the experience of patients receiving various medical devices during cardio-thoracic procedures.

 The NAICS Code is 813920, with a small business size standard 6.5 million.


B. Objectives:

The main objectives of this study would be to: 


1. Explore linking the STS clinical data to the CMS administrative claims data and/or other long-term clinical/administrative data. 

2. Based on the demographic and clinical information from the STS Database (age, admission diagnosis, date of surgery, date of discharge, etc), match the database patient to the same patient in the administrative data set. 

3. Use the STS Database to determine the device and clinical characteristics and severity-of-illness factors of a patient, and use the administrative data to determine the clinical course of that patient over the following years.
 
        
Methods: Specific information to be collected by the STS database includes

&#61607;	Demographic characteristics
&#61607;	Device characteristics
&#61607;	Pre-operative risk factors
&#61607;	History of previous interventions
&#61607;	Pre-operative cardiac status
&#61607;	Pre-operative hemodynamics
&#61607;	Operative procedure
&#61607;	Post-operative medications
&#61607;	Adverse events
&#61607;	Discharge data
&#61607;	Status at 30 days post-procedures
&#61607;	Long-term outcomes (based on the CMS data) 



C. Contract period of performance

The study will begin in September 2008. The duration of the first task of this five- year  
  contract will be two years.    


D. Procurement/Contract Strategy:

It is anticipated that a contract indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity task order contract. The contract will have a period of performance of  1 base year with 4 option year. This is a new requirement.  The NAICS Code is 813920 with a small business size standard of $6.5 mil.

 

E. Additional Information 

FDA intends to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP during on or around August 19, 2008. It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort September 2008.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.

<a href="mailto:kimberly.perkins3@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, with Maquet located at 1140 US-22, Suite 202 Bridgewater, NJ 08807 for services and supplies  to include, but  may not be limited to, the following:Contractor to install Ceiling Service Units - OR BoomsEquipment Description                            The BOOMS are a new range of ceiling service units expressly designed for operating rooms, intensive care and emergency units. Modules have been designed to offer large, unobstructed surface area for positioning outlets, accessories, and shelving to consolidate and organize equipment, utilities, and communications systems.Key Features include: High Capacity With Open Architecture    The very large, internal channel (up to 4.7 inches - 120 mm) is ideal for current and future capacity requirements (including multimedia use). The Boom range - from the light arm to the high capacity arm - has a reach of 24 to 94 inches (60 to 240 cm) using a combination of single or double arms. This provides excellent flexibility and modular site integration.Integration/Adaptability    The BOOM range incorporates all of the outlets and connections - all the way to the ceiling - that are essential for handling the various signals used in video, monitoring and integration. The option of cable management outputs on the module offers even greater flexibility in the choice of integration partners. Therefore, cables are easy to install and are given lasting protection. BOOM panels support all kinds of outlets, including multimedia, video, telephone and nurse call.Flexible and Easy to PositionThe booms can be easily moved due to their considerable rigidity and tapered roller bearings. Combined with friction brakes, this extra stability provides maximum strength for the workstation. Optional electropneumatic brakes make positioning of heavy loads easy. Brake options are available on all axes for maximum flexibility.Ergonomic designThe booms have been designed to revolutionize the existing standards in ergonomics and to be fully customized to the end user. Units are easy to position due to the positioning handles that feature integrated joint controls, smooth moving, tapered roller bearings, and a reliable brake system. Shelf-mount and/or module-mount positioning handles are available for maximum flexibility.Innovative - LEDinside    The ambient LED lighting located on both sides of the modules provides a soft light that effectively illuminates the workstation area for safely viewing the equipment on the shelves and the utility connection areas. In multimedia mode, LEDinside  technology improves the effectiveness of the operating unit by enabling a more precise viewing of on-screen images without glare.Longest ReachProvides longest reach (up to 2400mm/ 94") to ensure equipment can be moved into desired location even in the largest ORs.The device is a docking station which will be used to anchor equipment in the OR. Additional parts will accompany boom and require assembly. The location for the equipment being installed and delivered are OR 3, 4, 5 and 6 (new OR). This equipment will be manufactured with correct brass fittings and custom specifications. This equipment is compatible with the Storz video integration system which is currently being used in the ORs. In addition, the Da Vinci robot video signals will be routed through this system. And furthermore, the OR currently has the Gillenger lights which are retro-fitting lights and compatible with this system. The applicable NAICS code for this solicitation is 334510. This procurement is based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services and supplies available from this entity. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their qualifications/capabilities by detailing their experience in providing this service, to the Contracting Officer, by e-mail to Kimberly.Perkins3@va.gov . Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable and responses received after September 1, 2008 will not be considered. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity. VA Boston Healthcare System - West Roxbury Campus - Surgical Service 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole source procurement for OR supplies/services.Transaction No:   523-08-4-4906-06123.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). Ceiling Service Units - OR Booms. The device can swing and is a docking station to bring surgical equipment to the field. 4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. FAR 6.302 - ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE 5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. This equipment will be manufactured with correct gas fittings and customspecifications. This equipment is compatible with the Storz video integration system  which is currently in use in the OR and new AV video system Storz has been awarded. In  addition, the Da Vinci robot video signals will be routed through this system. In addition, the OR currently has the Gittenge lights which are retro-fitting lights and also compatible with this system. Therefore, Maquet Medical was found to be the only manufacturer capable of doing this.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Maquet was picked by the Operating Room Committee. Other sources solicited include:- Compview Nuboom System: this system would have to permanently affix to the operating room floor and is not practical for our purposes. - Berchtold Manufactures: they were contacted but did not respond at the time.7.
