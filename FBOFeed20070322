<DESC>The Italian Ministry of Defense (MoD) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the extension of the Bi-Strategic Commands Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS) Core to the NATO Unclassified Network.

The Italian MoD is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The Italian MoD intends to use the one envelope bidding procedure, in which the price proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.  

The estimated value of this project will not be disclosed at this time. The Host Nation reference for the project is 2001/5IS03024-0. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as a reference IFB-ITALY-BISC-AIS.

The IFB (Invitation for Bids) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED. The successful contractor, however, will be required to access locations at the level of NATO SECRET. Bidders, therefore, must have the appropriate clearances, and all such clearances must be in place prior to the contract award. It is the responsibility of the bidder to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel to be assigned to the contract.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The contract will require the provision and installation, including network cabling and integration, of the following equipment:

- High performance and general purpose servers
- Workstations
- Laptops
- Mid-sized routers
- IP switches
- Tape drivers
- Printers (B&W, color)
- Scanners
- Network cabling
- Software (various)

The contractor will be required to supply the equipment commensurate with the stated scope of the project and be ready to establish support capabilities in the proximity of the installation sites. Bidders will be required to demonstrate their ability to undertake the project; mandatory criteria for experience with the provision of a similar type of system will be included in the IFB. Candidates will be required to attend a site survey prior to the bidding. Bids from firms that have not participated in the site survey will not be accepted.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 17 April 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: April 2007

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: June 2007

4. Anticipated contract award date: June 2007

The project is expected to be completed within 6 months from the effective date of the contract.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Epidemiology, Pittsburg, PA 15213 for a pilot life study to measure the association between functional brain MRI activation and motor performance in the LIFE participants 1 year after the end of the intervention.  The contractor will acquire brain fMRI concurrently with 1 year follow-up data on physical function (400 meter walk and SPPB [31] and measures on cognitive function (digit symbol substitution test [DSST] [29], Stroop [30] and Teng Modified Minimental State Exam [MMSE] [32].  This work will include only those participants who have remained adherent to their original group assignment.  It is hypothesized that the invention group has greater fMRI signal activation in the executive control function regions, higher long term executive control function scores (as measured by DSST) and better mobility measures than the control group.  It is also hypothesized that these associations will be independent of global cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE.  This finding would suggest that this type of aerobic intervention is linked with greater neuronal activation.  The purpose of this study is to measure brain fMRI signal activation in a selected sample of participants of the Pilot LIFE study.  The contractor will obtain approval for this project from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh and will obtain an MRI agreement for the magnetic resonance center in Pittsburgh.  The contractor will prepare a manual of operations for this study, train the personnel to conduct the measurements and data management and oversee the quality control of data collection and management.  The data and a final report on the operations of the study and the study findings will be prepared and delivered to NIA.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Pittsburgh is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  The tasks to be done under this contract will be developed and supervised by researchers who have national and international reputations for their work in functional MRI assessment, geriatrics, exercise interventions and functional outcomes in older persons.  This team could not be assembled at any other academic institution.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million. This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)  at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  intends to negotiate with the Inova Fairfax Hospital located in Fall Church to establish a collaborative pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) program.  The primary objective of this collaboration is the development of a PAH program that utilizes Inova’s current facilities and the Heart Institute’s clinical practice and research abilities.  

NIH has a long history of an established integrative clinical research approach.  Its Pulmonary Vascular team in the Vascular Medicine Branch of the Heart Institute consists of physicians with expertise in pulmonary, hematology and cardiovascular diseases, all critical components in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.  Inova-Fairfax Hospital has a well established Pulmonary Hypertension Program with clinicians and coordinators skilled in the management and care of patients with various forms of pulmonary vascular disease.  The prospect of a partnership that combines the NIH and Inova Pulmonary Vascular Program has the potential for substantial benefit for both institutes and the affected patient population.  All patients recruited through NIH for study purposes would have the option of being followed/managed clinically through the Program. Inova would provide the day-to-day clinical management and care with the collaborative assistance of NHLBI.   While Inova is well established at the local/regional level as a referral center for various forms of advanced lung disease, it lacks a national/international reputation. NIH, specifically NHLBI offers this and the ability to attract patients outside the Washington, D.C. region, other states and countries.  Therefore, the Program will potentially bring expanded recognition to Inova in addition to the enhancement of NHLBI’s research studies for this condition.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement to establish a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) European Mid-Course Radar (EMR) site.  The EMR will perform ballistic missile acquisition, tracking, object discrimination, and kill assessment functions, and interface with the existing BMDS Command & Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) system.  The EMR is critical to the spiral development of the BMDS.  

The X-Band radar shall have sufficient power, aperture, bandwidth, and metric performance to meet stringent mid-course accuracies for both tracking and discrimination.  The contractor shall be capable of providing low risk integration of the radar with the components of the existing BMDS architecture.  To effectively meet these requirements, the contractor shall upgrade and relocate (including disassembly/reassembly) an existing MDA X-Band radar to fulfill the European Mid-Course Radar (EMR) requirement.  This radar is the Ground Based Radar – Prototype (GBR-P) currently located at Kwajalein Missile Range.  

The design, upgrade, disassembly/reassembly, build, integration, check-out, and standup of the EMR is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011.  The EMR is a highly complex, integrated system of hardware and software coupled with tactical and non-tactical communications equipment that allows for the acquisition, tracking, discrimination, and the real-time reporting of ballistic missiles.  The BMDS EMR will face a range of dynamic and technically complex system integration issues.  The EMR components shall be integrated together and into the overall C2BMC system of the BMDS.  The BMDS EMR System shall be compatible with the current BMDS architecture and shall support future system upgrades, expansion, or deployment of new BMDS components.  

In addition to the X-Band radar, the EMR system requires support buildings, security and force protection features and accommodations, radar control facilities, billeting, infrastructure such as power, water, sewers, storm drainage, secure communications links and support until EMR System acceptance and turnover to the lead military department.  Site planning and design is required for interfaces for all EMR System components, with traceability to the component requirements.  The contractor shall also integrate all Government and Contractor Furnished Equipment, including radar controls, radar real-time and non real-time software, radar simulations, diagnostics and calibration tools, commercial communications systems and other related tactical/non-tactical communications and radar equipment, into the design, development, and installation of hardware and software to support the EMR activation and operation.  Site build out and activation includes site development, build out of the tactical and non-tactical facilities and related infrastructure, communications links, equipment emplacement and activation, facility commissioning, and installation and checkout to include subsystem and system level tests (SSCO/SICO).    

The contractor shall implement procedures to ensure consistency and synchronization with evolving MDA X-Band development efforts.  Due to the complexity of the overall BMDS mission, the integration portion is crucial to the success of this project.  The contractor shall coordinate delivery, installation, and integration of hardware provided under other contracts to ensure synchronization across all contracts.  

The Raytheon Company designed, built, and continues to operate the GBR-P at Kwajalein.  Raytheon also provided the design, construction, integration, and operation of MDA’s current BMDS X-Band forward based radars (AN/TPY-2), and the X-Band Radar aboard the Sea-Based X-Band (SBX).  MDA intends to negotiate a contract with Raytheon Corporation for this integrated radar system under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(i) – only one responsible source.  As the developer of the aforementioned X-Band radar family, Raytheon is the only company that can provide the required radar upgrades, maintain the radar performance requirements, and provide integrated fielding efforts.  Utilization of any other source would result in unacceptable delays in deploying the radar to the operational site and jeopardize mission performance resulting in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition.  Entities that plan to assert that they are qualified to perform this effort must submit a statement of corporate capabilities relevant to this effort, not to exceed 5 pages in length, to the PCO no later than the closing date of this synopsis.  Entities interested in subcontracting possibilities should contact Raytheon directly.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR AWARD A CONTRACT.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>UPDATE #4: The RFP for this acquisition has been updated.  A summation of the amendments has been posted on the bidder's library under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access.  

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

               (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
               (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.  

The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<CONTACT>Paul Host, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4272, Fax 407-380-4742, Email Paul.Host@navy.mil
<DESC>CORRECTION TO PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT:

The NAICS appearing in the header of this announcement is INCORRECT.  The correct code is 511210, which was in the text of the announcement.

The Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).

The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand.

  The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with the study, analysis, design, definition, development, documentation, implementation, training management, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), and standardization of all aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials. This N7 tasking includes management and organizational support, front end analysis, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs; including extensive on-site support at the locations identified below.

Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Oklahoma and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC).  

NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their “Wings of Gold” from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC) – NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One – NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two – NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four – NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing Five – NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six – NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command’s aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control – Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0 with full Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliance.  The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all products, software, author-ware, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves “roughly” 40 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.

Contractor activities will include the design, development, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), conversion, testing, documentation, training, delivery of completed product to the government, and establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base.  The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.

A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).

Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server network, hardware, and software to support current and future requirements. All technology services provided must comply with Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) standards established by Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM). 

	It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  

           Anticipated contractual milestones are as follows:

•	RFP Release -16Apr07
•	Possible site visits – 7-11May07 
•	Proposals due - 14Jun07 
•	Anticipated award - 1Sep07
•	Anticipated contract start date - 1Oct07

The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR Subpart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be a 5-year contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 511210, are invited to submit a statement of interest to include possible teaming/subcontractor arrangements.  Information should be sent via e-mail to paul.host@navy.mil.

<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award one Janitorial Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery combination contract to be performed at various Naval and Marine Corps installations located in Southern California.  This solicitation is restricted to 100% percent Small Business Concerns to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561720 and the size standard is $15 million dollars.  See explanation of size standards at the following website: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.  This procurement includes Award-Option incentives.  The Award-Option incentive is intended to motivate and reward high-level performance in executing the provisions of the contract, see the Award Option Plan attached to this solicitation.  The performance period will include a 12-month base period, four 12-month option periods, and five 12-month Award-Option terms, for a total maximum duration not to exceed 120 months.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and price (Factor 6).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are approximately equal to price, Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal’s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  The evaluation factors are set forth below:
Factor 1: Experience
Factor 2: Past Performance
Factor 3: Technical Approach
Factor 4: Management
Factor 5: Safety
Factor 6: Price
Offeror shall submit its proposal in two (2) separate parts as follows:

1) Technical Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.

2) Price Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Include all other Price Proposal submission requirements shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation.  Price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder from the technical proposal, and clearly marked “Price Proposal”.  Offerors shall complete Exhibits A through K.  Option Period 1 through 4 and Award Options 1 through 5 include pricing for four service levels referred to as Common Output Levels 1 through 4.  OFFERORS SHALL COMPLETE ALL EXHIBIT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (ELINS) UNIT PRICES AND TOTAL AMOUNTS IN THE BASE YEAR AND FOR EACH COMMON OUTPUT LEVEL 1 THROUGH 4 IN EACH OPTION PERIOD AND AWARD OPTION PERIOD.  Only one Common Output Level will be awarded in each option period and Award Option Period, per ELIN.  Common Output Level 1 is the highest level of service, with COL 2, 3, and 4 being the lower level service.  The Government will award option periods and earned award option periods unilaterally.  

While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with RFP Factor 6, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any required cost-technical trade-off analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government:

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is not a request for quotes (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), request for application (RFA) or an announcement of a solicitation and does not assume the government will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitations in the near future. This notice is for market research purposes only. 

Federal Occupational Health Service (FOHS) provides comprehensive occupational health (OH) services to federal agencies throughout the federal government. The FOHS mission is to improve the health and safety of the government workforce by designing and providing innovative, customized, cost-effective occupational health, environmental and work/life solutions that exceed customer expectations. In keeping with this mission, the Clinical Division of FOHS provides a full range of health fair services. On occasion FOHS needs assistance from a contractor when coordinating larger health fairs. This assistance would include: attending meetings with agency prior to fair to determine specific needs; arranging on behalf of agency any specific permits necessary for fair; assisting with exhibit set up on the day of the fair; meetings with agency after fair. In addition to these services, the contractor may be asked to bring in vendors to perform screenings for bone density, glucose, cholesterol, and other wellness laboratory tests. Currently, the health fairs are only in the Washington, D.C. Metro region, but may extend to other surrounding states. 

Contractor would not be responsible for the procurement of tents, tables, or generators for health fairs; this will be the responsibility of the sponsoring agency.  However, contractor would need to make recommendations to the agency as to quantity of these items needed for the fair well in advance, no less than 90 days prior to date of fair.

Some health fairs may require special clearances or permits, which could include road closures.  Contractor will need to be well versed in this process and be able to attend necessary meetings to accomplish this task on behalf of the sponsoring agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order, base year (12 months) and possible four option periods (1 year each, total base plus options is 5 years), for tag distribution and data management of files related to the Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (CMTTP) on a sole source basis from University of Florida, Gainesville, FL based on the following reasons:  1) The purpose of this purchase order is to support the CMTTP.  Until April 1999 there were two sea turtle tag distribution and archival centers for the Western North Atlantic – NMFS SEFSC and the University of Florida, Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research; 2) The Archie Carr Center has distributed tags to many collaborators in all areas of the world since 1955, and they have established an internationally known database system and communication network.  Individuals of that network communicate throughout the world with local fishermen and other citizens and help to arrange for the return of tags from captured turtles; 3)  NMFS had maintained its CMTTP since 1980 but in April 1999, NMFS consolidated its database with that of the Archie Carr Center, transferring funds to the Center to support the purchasing of tags and for the managing the consolidated database; 4)  This purchase order will support the consolidated activities of the two groups, this serves to eliminate the duplication of necessary infrastructure, saving federal dollars; 5)  By consolidating activities it minimizes the duplication of tag identification numbers among programs and confusion associated with returning recovered tags to two separate entities, which would be most advantageous to the Government given the expense already put forth.  

Description of Work
1.	Purchase and distribute tags (#681 Inconel) and applicators according to NMFS/CMTTP tagging protocol {http://accstr.ufl.edu/cmttp.html}.
2.	Recover costs of tags and applicators from organizations requesting tags, when possible.
3.	Maintain database for tag distribution records and webpage for tag distribution inventory {http://accstr.ufl.edu/taginv.html}.
4.	Archive, as hard copy, all tagging data submitted by the cooperating tagging programs.
5.	Maintain the databases for tag releases.
6.	Maintain the databases of recovery records from recaptured turtles.
7.	Continue to reorganize and improve database structure to facilitate use by NMFS SEFSC.
8.	Disseminate data to “data owners” (per CMTTP policy) as requested.

<CONTACT>Tracy Miller, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-7027, Fax 202-254-7785, Email tracy.c.miller@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is seeking comments and ideas from industry, national and government laboratories, academia and other interested parties on an assessment program, hereafter referred to as the Red Teaming Assessments (RT) program.  For the purposes of this Request for Information (RFI), the mission of the RT program is to assess the overall effectiveness of technologies, tactics, and processes developed in support of DNDO’s mission to counter the threat of radiological and nuclear terrorism from an adversary’s perspective.  Specifically, this program will provide the DNDO an independent analysis and assessment capability (no access to privileged DNDO or Official Use Only information). The RT program would examine open source plans, procedures, protocols, deployed and future technologies, and identify potential current and future vulnerabilities within the overall DNDO global nuclear detection and reporting architecture from the “outside looking in.”  The goal is to identify vulnerabilities in the technology and operational procedures and to identify sensitive open source information that, while unclassified, would prove useful to anyone attempting to circumvent the global nuclear detection architecture.  Open source information may be augmented by elicitation, surveillance, site penetration and exploitation of perceived vulnerabilities.  The ultimate result of these efforts would be reports, both long-term (yearly) and short-term (three (3) months or less), which provide analyses of current and potential vulnerabilities in the global detection system and provide, as appropriate, mitigations for vulnerabilities.

2.  In response to this RFI, the Government requests that responders provide information and ideas as to the composition, in terms of staffing, technology, and management analysis tools, for an effective RT program.  Each response should address, at a minimum, the following  topics: 1) Staffing/Expertise Mix (to include the number of team members and technical/operational background of each); 2) Management/Communication (to include staffing, scheduling, location, and communication issues, especially in regard to classified material and cost management); 3) Operational procedures and protocols for the safe and legal conduct of: information collection and analysis, elicitation, surveillance, site penetration and simulated smuggling or use of radiological or nuclear material (to include NRC license and radiological source handling); and, 4) Accurate emulation of potential threat actors, their likely source materials and courses of action.

3.  Responses should be no more than ten (10) pages, Microsoft Office 2000 compatible, and should be sent to Tracy.C.Miller@dhs.gov.  Hard copy responses will not be accepted.  Charts, if submitted, should be easily viewed and illustrate topics discussed in the response.  Responses should include, at a minimum, the following sections: 1) Executive Summary (one page or less); 2) a discussion of each of the four topics listed above; and, 3) a brief organizational overview (one page or less) of the responder, to include structure and size, primary products (if any), field of primary expertise, duration of involvement in the field of primary expertise, and a description of any previous multi-disciplinary assessment experience.  The organizational overview should also include a statement on the ability to remain free of any Organizational Conflict of Interest within the radiological/nuclear detection domain.  If Respondent has a current government RT contract, please indicate the contract number and the agency point of contact.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD CONTRACT W91ZLK-07-C-0011 TO ADVANCED FLUIDICS, 4217 RED BANDANA WAY, ELLICOTT CITY, MD, 21042
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Agency, Directorate of Contracting, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD intends to negotiate solely (as prescribed in FAR 6.302-1) with Advanced Fluidics, 4217 Red Bandana Way, Ellicott City, MD 21042. The contractor shall produce a  prototype Rotary Thermalcycler comprised of mechanical, thermal and electronic components of DNA Amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and an integrated optical detection scheme. The period of performance of this requirement is 12 months  after contract award.  The Rotary Thermalcycler mechanical component prototyping, an FY2006 CBRN funded project, was completed successfully by the contractor, Advanced Fluidics. The Optical detection component prototyping builds on that work containing unique designs which must couple seamlessly. Both components have to be designed and built with the other in mind. Going with a different contractor at this point will significantly delay the production of this prototype which is scheduled to be field tested at the end of this (200 7) fiscal year. Failure to continue this requirement with Advanced Fluidics will deny the government a rapid biological surveillance capability. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees. Interested persons may identify their interest, in writing, to the Government point of contact. Responses to this notice must b e received no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Time,  March 26th, 2007. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. The point of contact for this action is Jeff Schoerner, Contract Specialist, email: Jeff.Sch oerner@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- TSOC Watch Floor Support
<SOLNBR>HSTS03-07-R-CAC010
<RESPDATE>021607
<CONTACT>Audrey Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-227-1582, Fax 571-227-2913, Email audrey.taylor@dhs.gov
<DESC>Question: Upon closer review of the solicitation, it became clear that the Government did not dictate how many watch standers are required per shift.

Answer: Correct, the Government is not asking for a specific quantity of people per shift. We are asking for 12 Watch Standers to work 80 hours per Government bi-weekly pay period.   The Contractor will work rotating shifts defined by the Government. The shift schedule is posted 14 days in advance and includes weekend and holidays.  

Question: Please clarify if the Government is defining an FTE as 2,080 or 1,920 hours per work-year?
Answer: The Government will be paying for 12 Watch Standers, each working 80 hours per government biweekly pay period. There are 26 Government bi-weekly pay periods in a year. The total annual work hours are 2080 per Watch Stander.  ( 80 X 26 = 2080)
 
The Government understands that a Contractor will get sick or take a vacation.  Any illness over 24 hours will require the Vendor to provide a replacement for the shift. If the Contractor is on vacation, the Vendor will provide a replacement during the vacation period.  

Question: Do signed NDA?s need to be included in the proposal or will that be handled on the first day of the contract?

Answer: Prior to the first day of the contract.

Question: Amendment 1 states that 24,960 hours are for six personnel. Is this a typographical error? Are the 24,960 for 12 personnel?

Answer: The requirement is for 12 people/24,960 annually except to account for leap year in 2008.

Question: Is the expectation that there will be six contractors per shift on the Watch Floor or will scheduling done by the government allow for days off etc?

Answer: Please see above response

Question: on page 31 & 32 of document HSTS03-07-R-CAC010-Watch Floor Support, appears evaluation criteria including criteria for evaluating firms with experience, and firms with no experience.  The wording seems to be at variance with the wording of the section labeled ?Past Performance Evaluation Criteria? on page 3 of 4 of the other document labeled RFP Instructions.
Please clarify how firms with much, some, little or no, past experience will be evaluated, and more specifically which of the two evaluation methodologies takes precedence in the event of a conflict. 
Answer: The question is unclear. Offerors with no past performance will not be penalized and will be rated as neutral. 

Question: The proposal must be submitted in 12 point font but if we use graphics can the font size go smaller than 12 point and if so, will there be a size limit on that?
Answer: Yes, must be submitted in 12 point font. 

Question:  Can you please clarify the definition of UNITS in the RFP?
Answer: UNITS=hours per year required

Question: Are the past performance citations required in Volume 1 included in the 10 page technical and management approach, or in addition to the 10 page limit for Volume 1?
Answer: Past performance is included in the ten 10 page limitation for Volume 1.
Question:  CLIN?s 1 thru 5 in Section B reflects a number (276,480) under the column titled ?UNIT?. Can you explain what this number means?
Answer: This number reflects the total amount of hours per year for the Watch Floor Standers.  This number has also been updated and reflects the correct amount of hours in amendment 1 posted on FEDBIZOPS.

Question: Paragraph 5.0 (Scope) states that, ?the scope of this procurement is to staff the TSOC Watch Floor 24/7/365 with 12 Full Time Watch Standers?. Does the Government require a total of 12 Watch Standers per shift, which would require a far greater number of personnel to support the Government?
Answer: Please see above response.

Question: In the instruction for Volume 2, it states, ?Provide an overall and detailed fixed price for the base year and all option years?as well as clearly identify the tasks as well as the composition of the pricing??yet in the SOW, the government states that the requirement is unless the emergency CLIN also known as surge CLIN is funded.  Please submit the 	applicable labor category and rate for personnel that may be assigned to this CLIN. Please also 	note this will convert the current proposed contract to a combination firm fixed price / labor hour 	contract.

In Section C it states that travel may be required.
	a. Will ODCs be reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis or a cost only basis?

               A total of 500 anticipated hours in the event of a national emergency is set up.
               Travel is an anticipated at a total cost of $2,000.00 per contract year. Long distance travel to 	TSA?s COOP facility may be reimbursed following Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) and as 	approved by the CO and / pr COTR in advance. Local travel remains unauthorized

	
Are the contractor's shift hours required to conform to the government personnel's shift hours? If so, please provide the government's shift schedule.  On page 23, the SIR states duty hours are M-F 0730 through 1730 with 10 observed holidays. This appears to be in conflict with the stated 24/7/365 schedule. Please confirm this clause was included in error. 
	 Section H.6, Government Holidays has been deleted from the SIR. 
	  The current watch floor schedule is anticipated as follows but is subject to change:
	  Shift 1: 6 Am to 6 PM
	   Shift 2: 6 Pm to 6 AM

Shift schedule is subject to frequent change without approval from Vendor. Shift schedules are set according to the Governments needs. Schedules are posted 14 days in advance.

  Will the Government accept personnel with Interim Secret Clearances upon contract award?
	Yes, the Government will accept Interim Secret clearance upon contract award pending finalized 	Secret status.

Will there be an ODC line to pay for the required drug tests?  
	The stated drug tests will not be necessary and has been deleted from the RFP in its entirety.

Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation and ion mobility spectrometers for trace explosives detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to conduct research on the performance capabilities of current and emerging trace detection systems being deployed to rapidly scan people and other items passing through security screening checkpoints for the presence of explosives. Trace detection systems normally rely on the removal, collection and preconcentration of particles that are collected from a surface by swipe sampling. The swipe is inserted into the detector where the sample residues are thermally desorbed for detection, typically by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of detector systems are being developed. For this purpose, NIST has several trace explosive detectors that represent current technology, but the representation is not comprehensive. Systems that utilize gas chromatography for separation before IMS detection are needed, as well as trace detectors that utilize active particle sampling systems that require no manual swiping. 

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Trace Explosive and Narcotics Detector, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

General Requirements:  

      1. The system must be able to analyze particles for trace explosives
2.	The system must utilize either:
a.	gas chromatography (GC) to separate the analytes
b.	an active (non-manual) particle sampler
3.	The detection system must be based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS).
4.	The quoted instrument must be suitable for desktop use or it must be hand-held.

Specific Requirements: 

1. The following analytes must be detectable: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and triacetonetriperoxide (TATP).  Ability to analyze additional analytes is not a requirement, but will add competitive value to the proposal.
2.	Sampling and analysis time must be less than 20 seconds per sample. 
3.	Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection (see note 1)) to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below).
4.	The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

***Note 1-  The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal. In IMS, background variations are very much smaller than the measurement repeatability (standard deviations) of reference samples, so samples at strictly defined LODs would exhibit a false negative rate of about 50% (assuming that the alarm thresholds were set at the LODs). To define an LOD where a positive alarm would be expected reliably (over 90% of the time), we must factor in the measurement variability. We define this value (LOD90) as the amount of substance that generates a mean signal three times greater than the standard deviation (s) of the individual measurements. The conversion from measurement units (a.u.) to amount of substance (mass) is via the slope of the sensitivity curve (S). We also assume that the mass of analyte in the blank is zero.

LOD90 = 3 • s • S, where S = Ämass/Ä(a.u.)

***Note 2 - The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the DL90, so that,

DC = 2 LOD90
