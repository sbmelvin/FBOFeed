<DESC>The C-130J requires Secure Voice remote controls that are Night Vision (NVIS) compatible.  The only remotes in the Government's inventory are not NVIS compatible.  Two different NVIS Panels have been identified by the item/program manager to be procured so the available remotes can be modified with the panel to become NVIS compatible.    The panels will be provided to the depot to be installed on the remotes in inventory.  Once the installation is completed, the remotes will be shipped to the C-130J bases.Part numbers for panels required are ON460523-8 and ON460513-8.  Market Research showed Photo Etch is the last known and only known source of these panels.Procuring these panels and upgrading remotes will enable the C-130J aircraft to meet mission requirements.The resulting contract will call for a firm quantity of 100 for each part number and an option quantity of 100 for each part number.

The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
7.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.

13.) Residential Housing is present in many of the units in this project and:  H 4  Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14) Units will not be released for treatment all at one time, but instead will be released as previously worked in units have been completed. Contractor should indicate on the submitted work schedule the sequence of unit release and completion dates at the time of submission of the RFP. 
15.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts.

ITEM 120
  
Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.

It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete preparation of the area by removing from the Units all cut materials unless materials must be prepared prior to the piles being burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.
Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

ITEM 125

Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.
It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification.

Vermont Center for Ecostudies developed the bird monitoring protocol being used by the NPS, and has also built up a network of volunteers who participate in this project.  VCE is knowledgeable in the specifics of this monitoring program, familiar with the parks and the specific bird monitoring routes being used, and VCE has been implementing this protocol for the NPS since 2006.  It would be in the best interest of the government to continue using the services of VCE for breeding bird monitoring, because this will increase consistency in data collection and volunteer over-sight, and reduce annual costs due to the vendor's need to become familiar with the parks and the monitoring procedures.  Therefore, in accordance with the above cited authority, the government intends to exercise option year one with Vermont Center for Ecostudies within 15 days after publication of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>RECOVERY TAS::14 1041:: TAS RECOVERY FIIS PMIS#152422 PATCHOGUE BULKHEADS REPLACEMENT.  This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.  The project is located at the Fire Island National Seashore Headquarters, approximately one hour east of New York City, New York.
The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price design-build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure.  The project solicitation consists of two (2) phases.  This Pre-solicitation Notice represents Phase One and is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process.  Firms interested in this acquisition must submit the required qualification submittal as discussed in this pre-solicitation notice.  The qualification submittals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors outlined below.  The Government will select up to five (5) firms as the most highly qualified based on the evaluation factors herein.  These most highly qualified firms will be sent a Request for Proposals (RFP) that will contain the NPS schematic design drawings, project requirements narrative, performance technical specifications, and evaluation factors for the Phase Two.  The contract type will be a firm-fixed price.  Offerors will be required to submit a proposal consisting of a technical volume and a business/price proposal.  The RFP will not require design drawings as part of the Phase Two proposal.  The RFP will provide the evaluation factors for Phase Two.  The proposals submitted in response to the RFP will be evaluated against the RFP factors and the Government will make a source selection based on these factors to the offeror submitting the best value (trade-off process) to the Government for award of a design-build, firm fixed price contract.  Notification will be provided to all offerors when they are eliminated from further consideration during both Phase One and Phase Two.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 237990, and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 million.  This project is available to all responsible design-build contractors, nationwide meeting the above-referenced NAICS code and size standard under a negotiated, full and open competitive acquisition.
The Scope of Work (SOW) includes design and construction of the replacement of the existing bulkheads at Patchogue, New York in the following areas:  (1) from the headquarters building extending north along the east bank of the river to Division Street, (2) optional construction to replace boardwalks, (3) optional replacement of finger piers, and (4) optional removal and replacement of free-standing piers adjacent to waterfront bulkheads.
The contractor's design will be based upon the schematic design drawings, project requirements narrative, and performance technical specifications that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two) to the firms selected as most highly qualified in Phase One.  The project design process will comply with National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ) standards.  At the completion of the construction effort, record (red-lined), hard copy drawings and as-built AutoCAD drawings/files shall be submitted by the contractor to the Government.
The estimated price is between $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 including all design and construction services.  The contract provides for preparation of design development and construction documents.
The Brooks Act does not apply to this acquisition since the requirement is NOT for Architect-Engineer Services but a design-build construction acquisition.  Interested design-build firms should note that an architect-engineering firm that was involved in the preparation of the final schematic design and performance specifications for this project is not eligible to participate in the subsequent design-build acquisition since this would be an Organizational Conflict of Interest (see Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest).
RFQ Qualifications Submittal Requirements:  All design-build firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a letter and qualifications submittal in an original and three (3) copies to the address below.  Electronic or facsimile submittals will NOT be accepted.  As a minimum, the design-build firm shall submit the information required to allow the Government to evaluate the qualifications submittal in accordance with the evaluations factors below; and shall include an organization chart of the proposed team, resumes for proposed key personnel, and identify similar projects to this requirement to indicate the "team's" prior experience.  The organization chart shall include the names of the key personnel, firms, disciplines, roles and responsibilities and/or technical expertise.  Submission of additional supporting material is encouraged, but only to the extent that it graphically (via drawings and photographs) substantiates the relevant project work identified in the qualifications submittal.  Additional information should not exceed twenty (20) double-sided pages.  It is recommended that the qualification submittal be spiral bound and developed and assembled in the same order as the evaluation factors contained herein.
In support of the sustainable practices of resource conservation and material recycling, submissions should be concise, make wise use of recycled/recyclable paper and other materials.  To the extent possible, printed/copied double-sided paper documents should be submitted.
In order to be awarded a contract, the interested design-build firms shall have an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) site (http://ccr.gov), and have its representations and certifications registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) (http://www.bpn.gov).
In order to be considered during the evaluation of Phase One, the RFQ Qualification Submittal due date and time is February 22, 2010 at 3:00 PM (Mountain Time Zone) at the following addresses:
Via Overnight Delivery Service or Hand Delivery:  National Park Service; Attention:  Margaret A. Lemke (Announcement No. A1000000350), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228-2838

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

For the
Operation of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Cafeteria

Solicitation No. RFJ-0-0210
Introduction
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is looking for expressions of interest from qualified organizations to operate a high-end cafeteria on our campus located in Golden, Colorado.  NREL is the only federal laboratory dedicated to the research, development, commercialization and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.  Through our Sustainable NREL Program, we are committed to "walking the talk" by minimizing our use of resources (energy, materials, and water) while receiving the maximum value from resources used — along with balancing environmental, economic, and human impacts.  
Objective:
NREL is in the process of determining the viability of having an onsite cafeteria.  As the nation’s premier National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we will require a cutting edge approach to energy efficiency in a cafeteria atmosphere to match our campus environment.  The cafeteria is expected to be approximately 8,000-12,000 square feet including kitchen, serving and seating areas and is expected to be able to handle an anticipated staff of 2,200 persons, with the potential of handling as many as 3000 in the near future, with an above average utilization.   It is expected the cafeteria will be able to provide breakfast, lunch and some catering for special events for a normal work week, Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to mid/late afternoon.
It is anticipated the cafeteria will be ready for operation in late 2011.  The subcontract for management of the facility will be for a five year period, with a base year and four 1-year options available.  NREL is seeking organizations with experience and knowledge in high energy efficient food preparation, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™) and state of the art energy efficient kitchen equipment that match the NREL mission.
We invite interested parties to submit their qualifications.  Interested parties should identify cafeterias that they have operated in the last three years as well as their experience working with architectural and interior designers to provide input into cafeteria designs. Please cite examples of previous work experience and include references of the owners of those cafeterias and their contact information.  References should be provided for each project outlined.
Any organizations located in Colorado interested in working with NREL to provide the services described within this sources sought notification should contact the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ATTN:  Karen Leitner, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1533, Golden, CO 80401-3393. Telephone calls will not be accepted; however, submittals by e-mail are encouraged and should be sent to: Karen.Leitner@nrel.gov. A list of interested firms will be maintained and considered for receipt of a Request for Proposal (RFP). Responses to this notice, whether mailed hardcopy or electronically, must be received by 4:00 p.m., March 8, 2010.
At this time this project is open to large and small businesses, however, this requirement may change prior to issuance of a Request for Proposal.  Only firms with a business location in Colorado are invited to respond to this Sources Sought Notice.  The NAIC code is 722212 with a size standard of $7,000,000.00 gross receipts averaged over a three year period.
Interested parties who wish to receive a RFP should be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.   Registration with the CCR is mandatory prior to Subcontract award so interested parties are encouraged to begin the CCR registration process as soon as possible.  
Responding to this request identifies your organization as an interested candidate only. Your submittal is not in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP).

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the Aluminum Powder, MIL-DTL-512C Type 3 Grade F Class 7.  Aluminum powder is primarily used in main charge explosives to produce a high explosive quality.  Aluminum powder is being procured to add with TNT for the current Air Force bomb fill; however, aluminum powder is also used in many munitions that support combat requirements.  Adding aluminum powder to TNT creates much additional heat during the detonation, which causes greater expansion of gases and consequently greater blast effect.  It is critical to combat effectiveness.  Aluminum powder requires several specialized skills and processes that exist commercially.  Commercial producers have a highly-trained, experienced workforce with critically required specialized skills and facilities to produce granulized varieties.  The specialized processes and facilities include melting the aluminum, adding the proper alloy(s), shooting the aluminum alloy through a nozzle into an inert medium to obtain the desired particle/granule size, and passivating the powder in environmentally controlled silos to allow safe handling.<BR><BR>If a solicitation is issued the government will utilize a Best Value, range bid approach, and the resulting contract could be a one year with potential options. Potential bidders should be aware that all quality requirements must be satisfactorily completed prior to initial production.  <BR><BR>Interested parties may request a copy of the full specification via email to benjamin.riessen@us.army.mil  Request must include your cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, and point of contact. A respondent to this sources sought survey must have available facilities, equipment, skills and personnel to provide the Aluminum Powder. Only SERIOUSLY INTERESTED firms whom feel they are capable of supplying the aluminum powder are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description and summary of the producers capabilities, including a brief description of their organization, name/address/point of contact, facilities/equipment, personnel, inspection capabilities, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria, and minimum and maximum monthly production rates of past production of same or similar items. Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to:<BR>U.S. Army Rock Island Contracting Command, ATTN:CCRC-AM/Benjamin Riessen, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Il 61299-6500, email benjamin.riessen@us.army.mil, and identify Aluminum Powder sources sought survey as the subject of your response. This sources sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this synopsis.<BR><BR>Responses to this Sources Sought should be forwarded via email to: Christian.Otto@us.army.mil NLT March 11, 2010.<BR>

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, located inPasadena, California, operating under a prime contract with NASA seeks potentialcontractors to support or provide analysis capability at the circuit and system levelincorporating part level test data and uncertainties to better assess risk in support ofthe Jupiter Europa Orbiter (EJSM) mission. It is hoped that tools or services can bedeveloped or contracted to the JEO mission. Organizations supporting these activities mayalso wish to present the capabilities and services at the Instrument Workshop in July ofthis year. BACKGROUND:	NASA has prioritized the Jupiter Europa Orbiter project as thenext flagship outer-planets mission.  The JEO spacecraft will be subjected to greatertotal ionizing dose (TID) radiation than any previous mission, up to about 3.0 Mega-radsbehind 100 mils of aluminum.  While existing shielding techniques provide means to reducethe part TID exposure to hundreds of Kilo-rads, it is hoped to minimize the spacecraftshielding mass via appropriate techniques. Consequently, it is anticipated that a greaterdepth of part and circuit modeling and analysis will be required for some critical flightelectronics designs than has previously been performed for NASA outer planet missions.This analysis will include engineering models of part parameter variations as influencedby radiation, age, temperature, and possibly initial tolerance; combining the partparameter models into circuit level models; determining circuit performance; andcombining probabilistic circuit performance information for critical circuits to assesssystem lifetime. Where this approach varies significantly from previous analysesperformed for outer planet missions is that this effort will include probabilistic data. The models for part parameter variation will incorporate supporting statistical data frompart tests.  Circuit models will address the combination of the statistically-based partmodel parameters, and the underlying uncertainties associated with them, in deriving thecircuit performance as a probability density function over the range of possibleoutcomes. Circuits or representative models of circuits are combined to form subsystems,and subsystems to form systems (power, C&DH, telecon, etc.) Given the nature of the highTID exposure, the part models should provide estimates of parametric performance vs. TID,as well as temperature and aging.  Ideally, these models should include the effects ofany coupling between the influence of these environmental factors:  for example, theextent to which high temperature operation exacerbates (or mitigates) the effect ofradiation. As such, it is expected that the generation of such models with requireradiation testing of parts, to either generate wholly empirical models of the parts, orto verify physics-based models. The overall system performance will include the circuitelements that contribute risk at various lifetimes analyzed, and the interaction of thosecircuits with each other to determine subsystem performance. At the circuit level and atthe system level results will include the likelihood of failure with respect to specifiedperformance criteria (e.g., limits of output for a circuit) at given points in themission timeline (e.g., Europa Orbit Insertion  EOI, EOI + 105 days, EOI + 180 days, EOI+ 270 days, etc).  New or different tools may be required or an effective means needed toextend and/or adapt existing electronic circuit simulation tools to process the modelsdescribed above, and produce the requisite outputs. The results will be risk oriented. Ananalytical capability is required to determine risk drivers at the circuit to systemlevel. This type of sensitivity analysis will provide insight into which parts, circuits,and subsystems are driving overall system reliability and risk. At the circuit level theywill indicate the risk contribution of the different parts.  For each part the salientcontributors to its unreliability (e.g., aging over the long mission or TID).  Inaddition, the circuit performance will be quantitatively ranked relative to their impacton circuit reliability, in an attempt to determine the risk drivers, i.e., sensitivity tooverall reliability. At the system level they will indicate the risk contributions of thecircuits included in the system model and the environmental conditions.  This informationwill be used as the basis of decisions regarding testing to obtain better part data andreduce uncertainty, redesign, and allocation of resources (e.g., part shielding materialsto reduce radiation degradation at a particular location). The tool, or tool set, thatprovides this capability is anticipated to be simulation based.  As such appropriateconvergence criteria will have to be developed and demonstrated on it for calculations atthe circuit and system levels to establish that it will provide acceptably accurate andtimely results. The envisaged simulation will not combine part failure probabilities intocircuit failure probabilities, and then combine circuit failure probabilities into systemfailure probabilities using conventional fault tree or reliability block diagramtechniques.  At the circuit level, for example, we want to quantify the circuit failureprobability as the probability that the circuit is unable to satisfy its performancerequirements. At the subsystem and system level, we want to quantify the probability, forexample, that the power or telecom (sub)system is unable to operate within itsperformance range. Engineers invariably incorporate margins into their designs, (from thepart to the system level), so even if some elements are operating beyond theirperformance specifications the circuit may still satisfy its performance requirements. Thus, conventional definitions of part failure are incompatible with the simulationsneeds. It is anticipated that the circuit and system models will require simplificationsto keep the size of the models practical.  The tool, or tool set, must have thiscapability. PURPOSE:  JPL is interested in receiving information from organizations withexisting processes and/or tools that perform some or all of these analysis steps usingstatistical data to characterize parts and to  model circuit and system performance.  Itis anticipated that the complexity and resources involved in developing this analysistool set will preclude development from scratch and that JPL will need to use an existingtool if such is available or else incorporate several tools that provide solutions toportions of the needed technology and then develop the remaining elements. Contractorsare urged to provide practical examples of the extent to which analysis tools are used toassess circuit, subsystem, and system risk including dealing with uncertainty issues. Theplatform used for any simulation algorithms and the process and time required todetermine that convergence has been reached should be discussed.

<DESC>This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL intends to issue a fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Wildlife Computers, Inc. Redmond, WA for sea turtle satellite tags, both FASTLOC GPS and Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) satellite tags. The satellite tags are used for sea turtle research to determine the impact of fisheries interaction, assess annual survival rates, and spatial distribution of sea turtles.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Authority Cited: The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 and FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Wildlife Computers, Inc. designed and built the above sea turtle satellite tags. They have proprietary drawings, engineering data, and the parts necessary to build these essential components.</p>
<p>As an example of the intricate requirements of sea turtle satellite tags, the following are minimum functional requirements of PAT satellite tags: <br />- weigh 80 grams or less, excluding tether and attachment (to animal) material, and positively buoyant when released from tether<br />- operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000m, temperatures of 0 to +60 deg C, and placed globally<br />- lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10,000 32 byte transmissions; tag with salt-water switch and with out-of-water sensor<br />- 316 MBytes of non-volatile flash memory; detailed data are stored in archival tag and summary data are transmitted at release<br />- 12-bit analog converters to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings<br />- 8-bit analog-to digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings<br />- depth accuracy of 1% or better, measurable between 0-1000m with a resolution of 0.5m<br />- temperature accuracy of 1% or better, measurable from 0 to +60 deg. C with a resolution of 0.05C<br />- on-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings and release date.</p>
<p>These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the similar studies; the government has since deployed 47 such tags in a post-hooking mortality study for ESA-protected loggerhead sea turtles. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. supplier that has popup satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle dies wearing the tag, scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system. These protocols include a mechanical failsafe system that releases the tag prior to the popup date if the turtle sinks past 1,500m and software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. The PAT tags also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using known-fate mark-recapture analysis methods.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit offers. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Ron Anielak at (816) 274-6951 or sent via email to: ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to manufacture sea turtle satellite tags; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's knowledge of sea turtle satellite tags. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering demonstrated knowledge and experience. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required supplies as stated herein. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue an IDIQ contract to Wildlife Computers.</p>

DLT Solutions, Inc.Notice of Intent
This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.201, for Full and Open Competition after exclusion of sources and FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Office of Surface Mining, Western Region, 1999 Broadway, Denver, Colorado, 80202 has a requirement to procure the following item:
Statement of Objectives for Server Client LicensesTechnical Innovation and Professional Services (TIPS) uses a software license management package to manage twenty-nine licensed software packages.  By utilizing a software that can track check-out and usage of these software packages TIPS has saved millions of dollars by avoiding purchases of software licenses that are not needed for concurrent use.
ObjectivesAnnual Maintenance is needed in order to continue to receive upgrades and support through Autodesk Subscription for the use of the Autodesk software products provided through TIPS.  Autodesk Map 3D, Civil 3D, and Raster Design are TIPS core software packages that provide tools for engineering design and review as well as geographic information system (GIS) capabilities.  The software is used by both regulatory and AML scientists specializing in geology, soil science, hydrology, civil or mining engineering, or related natural sciences. Autodesk software has been part of the TIPS core software for many years.  The associated software packages (i.e., Civil 3D, Map 3D, and Raster Design) were selected based on their advanced computer aided design capabilities and wide acceptance by professionals in the mining and mine reclamation industry as well as in state and tribal abandoned mine land and regulatory programs.  The Autodesk software also serves as the base engine for Carlson Mining, another of the core software programs that provides computer automated earthwork design capabilities necessary to easily and efficiently achieve Title IV and Title V efforts under SMCRA.  The Carlson Mining and Autodesk Raster Design packages run as components of Autodesk Civil 3D and Map 3D; they are not standalone packages.Autodesk has been a leader in computer aided design software for over 25 years.  Autodesk first revolutionized the software industry with the AutoCAD product, which introduced drafting on a PC.  The widespread popularity of AutoCAD software established Autodesks continued commitment to practical innovation that increases productivity and profitability in the drafting and design arena.  AutoCAD paved the way for Autodesk technology leadership in industries such as building, infrastructure, manufacturing, media and entertainment, and wireless data.  Today, Autodesk is a fully diversified software company that provides a wide variety of solutions for creating, managing, and sharing electronic (i.e., digital) data.  The Autodesk community includes more than six million users; in addition, they have four global strategic partnersMicrosoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and IBMas well as 2,500 third-party developers.For decades, engineering professionals have used AutoCAD software to create and edit precise spatial data for use in a GIS product to produce maps and reports.  In the mid 1990s, Autodesk Map software began removing the boundaries between CAD and GIS. Over the past decade, Autodesk Map 3D has evolved into a comprehensive GIS product that still includes the  complete, most current version of AutoCAD.  The precision editing capabilities of AutoCAD are well known. Autodesk Map 3D adds these capabilities to other GIS data formats and applications. With Autodesk Map 3D, you can compile links to multiple project components into a single composite document, support multiple users querying and editing drawings simultaneously, create and define real-world features and models, connect your GIS layers and CAD drawings to spatial and nonspatial databases, use real-world coordinate systems, and publish data to the Internet.Autodesk Map provides an AutoCAD based GIS tool for creating, maintaining, and communicating mapping and GIS information. Autodesk Map is built around the corresponding version of AutoCAD and includes all the functionality of AutoCAD.Autodesk Civil 3D is a powerful civil engineering application containing several programs, built upon AutoCAD as the foundation graphics engine, designed to significantly increase productivity, save time, and decrease costs. It uses an industry-proven dynamic engineering model that maintains intelligent object relationships, so a change made in one place instantly updates an entire project to help project engineers to work faster and more accurately.Autodesk Raster Design is an AutoCAD based image manipulation tool. Raster Design runs on top of the corresponding versions of AutoCAD or Autodesk Map. Raster Design allows users to edit and manipulate raster images directly inside AutoCAD based products. Autodesk Subscription is a complete software, support, and training offering that gives easy access to the latest Autodesk product releases and upgrades. With expert technical support, self-paced e-Learning, and a range of exclusive community resources such as product webcasts, weblogs, and prequalified beta programs, Autodesk Subscription helps to extend the power of design technology to the fullest. For an annual fee, the Autodesk Subscription program provides a complete solution to software upgrades that simplifies license management, improves budgeting, and minimizes disruptions to workflow. Program Benefits - The latest product upgrades and enhancements keep design technology up to date.  Fast, reliable web support from technical experts minimizes disruptions to workflow.  Flexible, self-paced e-Learning lessons help boost design productivity. Simplified license management reduces technology acquisition and administrative costs.  Prequalified status in beta programs gives users a unique influence over future product development and opportunities to network with Autodesk technical experts and customers worldwide.Autodesk Subscription keeps OSM up to date and up to speed. We and our state and tribal users will continue to benefit from increased productivity, predictable budgeting, and simplified license management for design technology. With Autodesk Subscription, weu receive the latest Autodesk software releases, any product enhancements, web support from Autodesk technical experts, self-paced online training to improve your design skills, and a broad range of other exclusive technology and business benefits.Effortless Technology UpgradesAutodesk Subscription protects our investment in reclamation design technology because the TIPS software is always up to date. Each time a new version of your Autodesk software becomes available, it is automatically available to us. It cant get any easier than that. And only subscription customers are entitled to continue using previous versions of their licensed software after installing an upgrade; this eliminates workflow interruptions that often come with new software installation and implementation.Exclusive Subscription Portal The password-protected Subscription Center provides an exclusive online destination from point of purchase through installation and upgrading. The Subscription Center features tools allow easy administration of the subscription contract. It provides coverage and renewal reports, provides users access to included services, allows update of contact information, and provides access to exclusive subscriber-only offers and enhancements.Support from Autodesk ExpertsWith subscription we can take advantage of web support that allows submittal of technical questions directly to Autodesk support staff.  Questions are routed to Autodesk technicians who provide responses through email and the web. The Subscription Center includes incident reporting and tracking tools that make it easy to monitor the status of the questions asked and the responses provided by Autodesk. Also, use of Subscription Center, keeps CAD Reasearch, Inc., our Autodesk Authorized Reseller in the loop on all support communications.Skills Building e-LearningAutodesk Subscription includes access to self-paced e-Learning lessons for many Autodesk products. This is a perfect complement to TIPS classroom or customized training.  The e-Learning modules include short, interactive lessons with practical exercises and simulations designed to help in mastering key features of Autodesk software. e-Learnings built-in skills assessments allow anyone to analyze their existing skills and be directed to specific e-Learning lessons to develop additional strengths. e-Learning is accessed directly through the Subscription Center.

<DESC>Contract No: R10PX30106
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition - Sole Source to General Electric
1.  Office requesting the actionHoover Dam Office
2.  Nature and/or Description of proposed actionMark oneX  sole source acquisition   ___limited competition action
3.  Description of supplies or services required to meet agency's needs:
Repair two damaged rotor pole windings on Hoover Unit A5.
The contractor designed and built the unit in 1943. The contractor rewound and uprated the unit in 1982. The contractor maintains a field service division which is familiar with the unit design and the method necessary to complete repair to the pole connections.  General Electric possesses the original design data and drawings which enable the repaired pole windings and connections to be identical to the remaining poles and connections on the rotor.  All rotor windings must match in electrical characteristics as well as aerodynamic and physical characteristics for the unit to perform correctly.
4.  Estimated value:  $189,489.00
5.  Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source
5a. Discussion in support of the above authority:
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for repair of two damaged rotor pole windings on Hoover Unit A5.  The unit was designed and built the unit in 1943 and was then rewound and uprated in 1982. There is only one source that maintains a field service division which is familiar with the unit design and the method necessary to complete repair to the pole connections. This source is the only one that has the original design data and drawings which enable the repaired pole windings and connections to be identical to the remaining poles and connections on the rotor. All rotor windings must match in electrical characteristics as well as aerodynamic and physical characteristics for the unit to perform correctly.  Due to the urgency of the requirement there was no time to allow other vendors come out and try to reverse engineer the A5 Generator when GE was in possession of the only drawings and is the OEM.


6.  Effort made to obtain offers from multiple sources.  Name the source(s) from which the product(s) or service(s) are to be acquired.
Because of the urgency of this requirement and GE is the only owner of the drawings and the OEM of the generator and there are no other sources to solicit.
7.  Description of market research performed.  Explain actions taken and provided (by attachment) documentation of results of the market research, or an explanation of why no market research was done.
A notice of intent was posted on FBO in which another vendor expressed interest however since the designs were not available to provide they would have to come and try to reverse engineer the generator.  Due to the urgency of the requirement there was not enough time for this to occur. 
8.  Determination of fair and reasonable cost.  Explain how we know or will be able to determine reasonableness of price/costs.
The Purchase Order was issued on established fixed prices determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of award.  A cost analysis was conducted to compare the estimated labor hours, travel expenses, and materials/shipping costs.   Costs provided by GE were compared to GSA pricing for travel and similar labor categories, and technical expertise provided by the end user.

<DESC>ELECTIRCAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 3, Division of Construction and Acquisition at Ft. Snelling, Minnesota, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Hach Hydromet, of Loveland, Colorado for water monitor multi-probes needed to continue a three year water quality study at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge, Middle River, Minnesota. The study is a cooperative effort between the Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Red Lake Watershed District. The study consists of eight sites at which water quality parameters have been continuously monitored for the past two years. The items are replacements for damaged probes. Certain water quality parameters, such as turbidity, are relative to the type of probe making the measurement. Therefore, it is essential for data parity, that the probes are Hach Hydromet for comparing data from other sites and previous year's data sets. It is also essential that this equipment interface with the cooperator's software and display units.

Roudebush VAMC and to include materials and educational support in the implementation of the Safe Choices training of the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center.  This proposed award is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.The RL Roudebush VAMC is an active member of the Indianapolis Patient Safety Coalition and standardizing patient safety programs is a basic premise of the membership.  The Indiana Patient Safety Center has chosen Just Culture to be the model for managing behavioral responses to events.  Active membership is consistent with VAs mission of improving the safety and quality of patient care at and is highly recommended to ensure consistency in patient care to improve patient safety.  To fully participate, VAs employees must receive training and education consistent with the IPSC.  As founders of the Just Culture, Outcome Engineering has developed products and services to assist organizations in achieving success in their Just Culture efforts. Outcome Engineerings suite of tools is based on over two decades of development, combining elements from engineering, human factors, and the law. Beginning in aviation, their experience has grown into high-consequence organizations across the globe, including healthcare, rail, nuclear power, and emergency response.  The Managers Training Package includes trademark protected items which include Just Culture Training for Healthcare Managers, Just Culture Event Investigations, and Just Culture Coaching & Mentoring in addition to the Just Culture Training for Physicians.   These items are exclusive to the Just Culture Program which mirrors the required actions by the National Center for Patient Safety.  The National Center for Patient Safety is a program required by the VA to assist in identifying high risk situations and how to treat them but does not include the managers role in how to deal with the less high risk events that come up every day. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Responses received on or before February 19, 2010, will be considered. No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email at connie.mckay@va.gov.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">This technology addresses two important technical problems associated with Special Nuclear Material (SNM) detection. The first is that SNM detectors are generally sensitive to cosmogenic and ambient background gamma-rays and neutrons in addition to any potential real SNM source. This has the effect of reducing the sensitivity to real SNM. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Real SNM tends to emit small numbers of neutrons simultaneously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since background sources of simultaneous neutrons are relatively rare, high multiplicity neutron events become a key signature for the presence of SNM.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The second problem is ease of operation in the field--environmental and physical safety. Currently, few options satisfy all these requirements. Presently, most detectors require materials that are either expensive, hazardous or need to be operated at cryogenic temperatures. Plastic scintillator detectors have recently been employed to overcome safety issues and enable large detectors. However, plastic scintillators are expensive to approach </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">4</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&pi; coverage of a cargo container; hence are unlikely to be sensitive to neutron multiplicity.</span></p>

LLNL's detector is equipped with fast timing capability so that the time correlations between seccessive events can be measured. These time correlations are characteristic of SNM and greatly aid with background rejection, provided sufficient solid angle coverage is available to ensure an appreciable probability for interception of multiple neutrons. </span>The LLNL detectors can be built from the 0.25 cubic meter scale to the many ton scale, <span style="COLOR: #0070c0">guaranteeing large solid angle coverage.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC),  intends to award modifications to its Medical Facility Operation and Maintenance (OMEE) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contracts which will extend the ordering period by six months.  The modifications will have a $0.00 associated with them and the action is exclusively for a time extension of the ordering periods.  The OMEE Program requirements are currently executed via Firm-Fixed Price Task Orders which are placed against four (6) ID/IQ Contracts in order to provide quick response for Operation and Maintenance services including repair and replacement of equipment and minor construction services at Government medical and non-medical facilities in the continental Unites States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Korea, and Japan.  All current contracts were made under full and open competition procedures.  The contracts were awarded in Fiscal Year 2004.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in March 2010.  As a result, CEHNC has developed its acquisition strategy and is in the process of conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on OMEE acquisitions under NAICS Code 561210.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in May 2009, and the awards are scheduled to be made in late Spring or early Summer 2010.  If the contracts are awarded earlier than expected, the Government would no longer issue orders under the old contracts but would transition to the new suite of contractors.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  W912DY-04-D-0022 (VW International, Small Business), W912DY-04-D-0023 (JWK International, Small Business),  W912DY-04-D-0024 (AMES Corporation, 8(a), SDVOSB), W912DY-04-D-0026 (Quality Services International, 8(a), SDVOSB, W912DY-04-D-0027 (Large Business), and W912DY-04-D-0028 (Linc Government Services). <BR> <BR>The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.<BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result, given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior OMEE experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for Medical Facility Operation and Maintenance Services, the actions proposed within this announcement appear to be justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after the publication of this Notice of Intent will be considered by the Government.

These circuits connect the VA facility at 150 Huntington Ave, Jamaica Plain to various location throughout Boston.These circuits already exist and are due to be replaced this year under the Networx contract.

The Government intends to award this contract to a small business. It is the Governments belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement in a timely and cost effective manner. It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate with only this source.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ABOUT THE COMMISSION.</span>&nbsp; The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United   States&rsquo; trade and economic ties with the PRC.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">Over the past decade,      what have been the major trends and developments regarding the PRC&rsquo;s      involvement in regional and international institutions? What is the likely      course of such trends over the next 5-10 years? <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a>The      report shall examine both international and regional institutions, with      specific analysis as to China&rsquo;s      role, differing approaches and strategies and goals being pursued by China      in each such institution. Specific institutions to be examined could      include &ndash; but would not necessarily be limited to &ndash; the United Nations,      the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World      Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International      Settlements, the Asian Development Bank, the Asia Pacific Economic      Cooperation Organization (APEC), the International Atomic Energy Agency      (IAEA), the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN+3, and the Shanghai Cooperation      Organization. China&rsquo;s      role in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its attendant fora (Doha      Round, etc.) is not intended to be a subject matter for this report.<span>&nbsp; </span>&#61472;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">What is the status &ndash;      and assessed likely future status &ndash; of the PRC seeking increased      representation &amp; staff positions in these international organizations?      What have been China&rsquo;s      financial contributions to each institution and what changes are expected      in the future, if any?<span>&nbsp; </span>What has      been the measurable effect, if any, of China&rsquo;s increasing influence      on the policy of such organizations? Identify and explicate relevant      examples and case studies of such developments in recent years, and assess      the implications for the United        States in the areas of economic,      foreign and security policy.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">What evidence is      there to indicate <span style="color: black;">whether there might be a de      facto free trade bloc forming through ASEAN + 3, with China at the center,      and from which the United States might be excluded? If this were to prove      true, how would this impact the U.S.      economy and U.S.      relationships in the Pacific region?</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">Within the IMF and      the World Bank, does China      support conditionality for loans to developing nations, particularly those      in Africa?<span>&nbsp; </span>What role has China      taken in establishing institutional policies on good governance and      transparency in lending and investments in Africa?<span>&nbsp; </span>What evidence exists to support the view      that China      has provided funding for development projects in return for access to      minerals or raw materials? </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">How does China&rsquo;s membership at the IMF affect the      Fund&rsquo;s policy decisions and commentary on China&rsquo;s management of its      exchange rate? </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">The report should      provide an overview of the timing and circumstances of PRC commitments to      and participation in UN peacekeeping operations. What evidence exists of significant      PRC economic investments or financial interests in the countries in which      the PRC has committed to UN operations? What impact, if any, does a country's      relationship with Taiwan      have on how the PRC handles UN peacekeeping policies in response to crises      affecting that nation or region?&nbsp; What affect does a country&rsquo;s diplomatic      or other relationships with Taiwan (or lack thereof) have on <span>&nbsp;</span>the way that the PRC responds to UN      requests?<span>&nbsp; </span></li>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">Prior to the award of      any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central      Contractor Registry (CCR).</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">Once a contractor has      been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed,      public notice of this will be made on the Commission&rsquo;s website. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">The Commission&rsquo;s goal      is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.<span>&nbsp; </span>In ordinary circumstances, once a      contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a      draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no      later than 120 days from the date of contract confirmation. The Commission      will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within      30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days      of formal receipt of the Commission&rsquo;s comments.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Commission recognizes that, under      certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare      the first draft of the report under the contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor, in their initial      submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial      review draft.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is to be understood,      however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for      the Commission.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">As work on the report      progresses, the Commission&rsquo;s Research Coordinator shall act as a      representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and      responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in      the RFP. The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be      entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to      readings of the draft in progress.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; margin-bottom: 16.2pt; text-align: justify;">The contract shall be      subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of      unsatisfactory quality.</li>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />February 9th, 2010<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />5:30 PM, March 2nd, 2010<br /> <br />The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the national-level science programs of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the implications of such programs for future U.S. technological and economic competitiveness.
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the PRC. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov .</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission... shall investigate and report exclusively on...<br />ECONOMIC TRANSFERS-The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of high technology, manufacturing, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on United States national security, the adequacy of United States export control laws, and the effect of such transfers on United States economic security and employment..."<br />UNITED STATES-CHINA BILATERAL PROGRAMS-Science and technology programs, the degree of non-compliance by the People's Republic of China with agreements between the United States and the People's Republic of China on prison labor imports and intellectual property rights, and United States enforcement policies with respect to such agreements..."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on the national-level science programs of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the implications of such programs for future U.S. technological and economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Provide an overview, examination &amp; assessment of China's national-level programs to encourage scientific modernization, from the 1980s to the present. Such programs would include: the "863" Program, the "973" Program, the "Climbing" Program, the "100 Talents" Program, the 15-20 Year Science &amp; Technology Program, et al. Such an overview would also include an examination of the relationships of these programs with China's 5-year state economic plans.<br /> <br />2.	Explicate and analyze the identifiable policy linkages, if any, between these national-level programs and China's industrial policy (as detailed in the Commission's 2009 Annual Report to Congress). If such connections exist, what might the implications be for U.S. economic competitiveness in fields of emerging technology?</p>
<p>3.	Assess the budgetary commitment and resources made available to further these programs by the Chinese government.   In preparing this assessment, the report should examine not only direct contributions, but other forms of support including such areas as below-market financing from banks, tax rebates and free or reduced-price land.</p>
<p>4.	Explicate and analyze the identifiable policy linkages, if any, between these national-level programs and the increasing capacities of China's military-industrial complex. Are there identifiable ways in which China's capacity to produce more advanced indigenous weapons systems has been improved by the Chinese government's investments in scientific education and research over the past two decades? If so, does this reveal any likely trends for the future?</p>
<p>5.	Explicate and assess the methods commonly employed by the PRC for obtaining advanced technologies from other countries. This would include both an assessment of legal means used to pursue such technology transfers - such as establishing joint ventures with Western firms or other forms of participation by Western firms in Chinese scientific modernization efforts, and purchasing stakes in foreign firms possessing desired technology - as well as illicit means such as industrial espionage and illegal technology export. The report should evaluate the use of incentives by the Chinese government to encourage U.S. and other foreign firms to relocate research and development capacities to China.  The report should also include, where available, specific examples of U.S. and other foreign entities participating or providing support to achieve China's military or civilian sector goals.</p>
<p>6.	Identify cooperative scientific and research development programs between Chinese and U.S. universities, colleges and other educational institutions and associations that are engaged in efforts covered by China's "scientific modernization" programs.<br />7.	Assess the identifiable relationships, if any, between the priority technologies identified in China's national science programs and the sectors of U.S. technology most frequently targeted by China for acquisition, whether by means legal or illegal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p><br />2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />3.	The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of contract confirmation. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments.  The Commission recognizes that, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract.  The contractor, in their initial submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial review draft.  It is to be understood, however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p><br />4.	As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Coordinator shall act as a representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in the RFP. The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p><br />5.	The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p><br />6.	At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this Request for Proposal may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p><br />7.	Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant that it/he/she will perform this work solely for the Commission, and that the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p><br />8.	The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p><br />9.	After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the Contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's web site and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p><br />10.	A contractor will be expected to participate, as appropriate, in activities relating to the dissemination of a final report, at the discretion of the Commission. Briefing requests will be reasonable and will be subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p><br />Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p><br />1.	The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time.</p>
<p><br />2.	The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key issues and questions to be addressed by the report").</p>
<p><br />3.	The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p><br />Proposal submissions should include:</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />February 9th, 2010<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />5:30 PM, March 2, 2010
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the development of China's aviation and aerospace industries, and the potential impacts on future U.S. economic and national security.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the PRC. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov .</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission... shall investigate and report exclusively on... ECONOMIC TRANSFERS-The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of high technology, manufacturing, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on United States national security... and the effect of such transfers on United States economic security and employment."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on the development of China's aviation and aerospace industries, and the potential impacts on future U.S. economic and national security.</p>
<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Provide an assessment of China's market for commercial aircraft. What is the status of China's current and likely future market for commercial passenger aircraft, general aviation, cargo aircraft, and helicopters? As China's economy grows, and as it enhances its transportation infrastructure over the next 5-10 years, what will be the likely extent of its need to purchase new aircraft? To what extent will China likely rely on foreign firms (Boeing, Airbus, Sikorsky, United Technologies, General Electric, Bombardier, Embraer, Gulfstream, etc.) for such aircraft purchases, and to what extent will China's own emerging domestic aviation industry be able to meet these needs? This study would evaluate China's anticipated demand; its own domestic production capabilities; assess significant trends and developments in its domestic aviation industry; and assess what impact these factors might have on U.S. producers and on the global aerospace industry as a whole.</p>
<p>2.	Assess the role of technology transfer in the development of China's aerospace industry. Reporting in the Chinese media and statements by PRC officials have emphasized the role of "international cooperation" in some aviation sectors, and most particularly in the development of a large passenger aircraft. What are the means by which the government of the PRC encourages such aerospace technology transfers, and what are the implications for the U.S. aerospace industry?</p>
<p>3.	Assess the role of offsets in the development of China's aircraft industry. What are the offset requirements that China has imposed in the purchase of Boeing and Airbus commercial passenger and cargo aircraft? What is the extent of technology transfer that may have occurred as a result of these offset requirements, and what has been the impact on jobs and manufacturing capacity in the United States?</p>
<p>4.	Identify other efforts of the Chinese aircraft sector to develop its aerospace industry including private aircraft, helicopters and aerospace parts, systems and subsystems (engines, avionics, etc.)</p>
<p>5.	Assess the speed at which China has developed its domestic aerospace sector.  In conducting this assessment, the report will review analyst reports over the last decade and their assessments of China's domestic production capacity, technical expertise, efforts at systems integration and other factors relevant to production efforts and the time horizon estimated for reaching competitive status.  The report will also assess how accurate these assessments have been and whether Chinese development efforts have met, exceeded or failed to meet the goals identified in those reports.</p>
<p>6.	Identify joint venture and other cooperative production and research and development activities of U.S. aerospace firms with Chinese firms. This should include formal cooperative activities (such as Boeing's agreement with AVIC to develop and manufacture composite parts and Airbus assembly programs) as well as more limited activities.</p>
<p>7.	Identify current production activities of Chinese firms in the aerospace sector including the production of regional jets (such as the ARJ-21) and cooperative efforts with Bombardier and Embraer. Catalog any current or prospective orders that Chinese companies have obtained from other countries for sale of aircraft produced in China.</p>
<p>8.	What goals has China pursued by forcing U.S. and European-based companies and their governments to compete for contracts?   What has the impact been on technology transfers?  To what extent has China been successful in these efforts?</p>
<p>9.	Identify the extent to which Chinese companies, or production from foreign-invested or owned firms in China, supply U.S. aerospace firms (Boeing, Sikorksy and others).  Specifically identify the products being produced and the airframes on which they are currently being utilized. Assess the extent to which replacement parts are being sourced from China (either Chinese firms or foreign firms operating in China) for use on aircraft traveling in U.S. airspace. Catalog what specific servicing agreements currently exist, or are planned, for aircraft operated by U.S. carriers or for aircraft that will be operating in U.S. airspace (including private, commercial, cargo and helicopters).</p>
<p>10.	Research performed for the Commission in 2009 (Defense Group Inc., "China's Defense Industry on the Path of Reform," report released Nov. 2009) revealed how China's commercial aviation sector is providing spin-off benefits for military aviation. Following up on this earlier research, this new report would further examine China's growing aerospace capabilities in the military arena, and assess what it means for the security interests of the United States in the East Asia region. Specific topics to be addressed could include - but would not necessarily be limited to - the development of a 5th generation fighter aircraft, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and China's dramatically expanding missile forces. The report should also address the ways in which international cooperation in the civil aerospace sector could contribute to the development of China's military capabilities.</p>
<p>11.	Assess China's emerging commercial and military capabilities in space. Specific topics to be addressed could include - but would not necessarily be limited to - the implications for the United States of China's expanding role as a provider of commercial satellite launch services, and the national security implications of China's development of military capabilities in space.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />February 9th, 2010<br /> <br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />5:30 PM, March 2nd, 2010
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the efforts of both the United States and China to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies, and the implications of such efforts for the future of the U.S. economy and the U.S. manufacturing base.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the PRC. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov .</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission... shall investigate and report exclusively on - <br />...<br />ECONOMIC TRANSFERS-The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of high technology, manufacturing, and research and development facilities, [and] the impact of such transfers on United States national security... and the effect of such transfers on United States economic security and employment...<br />ENERGY-The effect of the large and growing economy of the People's Republic of China on world energy supplies and the role the United States can play (including joint research and development efforts and technological assistance), in influencing the energy policy of the People's Republic of China..."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on the efforts of both the United States and China to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies, and the implications of such efforts for the future of the U.S. economy and the U.S. manufacturing base.</p>
<p><br />Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Assess parallel developments of both the U.S. and Chinese "green technology" sectors. What are the comparative efforts being made in both countries to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies?</p>
<p>2.	Identify the leading green technologies under development. Identify how each country's efforts correlate to the green technologies list identified by the World Bank.  What is the comparative "state of the art" in these technologies in both the United States and China - i.e., who is "leading" and who is "lagging" in the development of these technologies? What are the most prominent companies and research institutions developing these technologies in each country? What, if any, is the role of government agencies in promoting these technologies? And, how does the development of green technologies in the United States and China compare with related efforts in other parts of the world?</p>
<p>3.	Assess the overall balance of trade between China and the United States in such technologies, as well as the specific trade patterns, over the last five years, in each major product area. Explicate the steps taken by each government to promote their own industrial development in the green technology sector. Specific topics to be addressed would include - but would not necessarily be limited to - the employment of industrial subsidies, favorable tax policies, restrictions on market access, etc. If such steps have been, or could be, taken, which of these methods might violate international rules regarding industrial subsidies (including both prohibited and actional subsidies, as defined by the WTO)?</p>
<p>4.	What role has China played at WTO talks on a sectoral agreement on environmental goods?  How might a sectoral agreement in this area advance U.S. and Chinese interests?   Identify the current trade barriers, if any, maintained by Chinese in the area of environmental products and whether those barriers would be addressed by the current approach being taken by U.S. trade negotiators.</p>
<p>5.	China has signaled that it intends to limit government procurement of technology products that don't have Chinese intellectual content. How does this relate to China's WTO commitments? What would be the effect of such a policy on U.S. industries? What would be the effect on U.S. companies and industries if this restriction were also adopted by China's state owned enterprises?</p>
<p>6.	Identify specific sourcing and development contracts that Chinese companies have engaged in to supply green technologies to the U.S. market.  As part of this effort, review specific opportunities for providing Chinese content that have been created by Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (for example, the "Texas Wind Farm" project).  Identify any other ARRA or other U.S. federal funds that have been used to procure Chinese-sourced green technology products or components.</p>
<p>7.	Identify Chinese activities in the U.S. market to manufacture green products for use in the U.S. market.   How are these facilities going to be sourced and what is the percentage of U.S.-produced components that will be utilized in such facilities (for example, the Chinese-announced photovoltaic assembly facility to be located in Arizona).</p>
<p>8.	What U.S. companies have been able to supply green technologies for use in China?   To what extent are these products produced in the U.S.?</p>
<p>9.	Does China have a stated industrial policy related to green technology research, development, and manufacture? How does the 11th Five Year Plan approach this topic?</p>
<p>10.	China has developed thriving industries in solar panels, wind turbines, and optoelectronics. What are the identifiable factors that led to China's preeminence in these fields? Also, to what extent are these products being manufactured for export, and to what extent are they produced for domestic consumption?</p>
<p>11.	In terms of joint ventures in the green technology sector between foreign and Chinese firms, are there any identifiable issues related to the potential transfer to <br />China of dual-use technology, and/or the transfer of manufacturing and managerial know-how that could have spin-off benefits for military-industrial manufacturing?</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>

<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>3.1 General: <br />The USCG is currently procuring a fleet of HC-144 aircraft. This aircraft can be flown in various configurations, one of which allows for carrying a MSP for operational missions. The MSP weighs approximately 2000 lbs, and can be removed from or installed into the aircraft through the aircraft's cargo ramp and ventral door, located at the rear of the aircraft. A forklift with roller forks can be used to install and remove this pallet; however, due to clearance and safety concerns, a pallet loader is preferred. The pallet loader must be capable of transporting a MSP from the aircraft hangar or shop to the aircraft, and then lift the MSP to a height of 50 inches above ground level for loading or removing the pallet into/from the aircraft. The pallet loader will be towed behind an appropriately sized aircraft tug with the pallet loader in the lowered position when transporting it to / from the aircraft / hangar. When in the lowered position for MSP transport or MSP maintenance, the platform of the pallet loader should not exceed approximately 20 inches above ground level. Dimensions of the base of the MSP are as follows: Length: 108.5 inches, Width: 62.5 inches, Thickness of the pallet: 3.5 inches. The pallet loader will be used strictly on the aircraft apron (ramp) or in the aircraft hangar and avionics shop. On occasion, a pallet loader will be transported inside the HC-144 to a deployed site. When transported, the pallet loader will be secured to the aircraft cargo ramp. Due to weight bearing limitations of the aircraft cargo ramp, and due to weight &amp; balance considerations for flight, the maximum weight of the pallet loader cannot exceed 2200 lbs (lighter is preferred). The USCG currently owns eight HC-144 aircraft and three MSPs. Additional procurements for aircraft and MSPs are planned, resulting in a fleet size of up to 36 aircraft and MSPs. It is the intent of the USCG that all MSPs will have their own pallet loader.</p>
<p>3.1.1 Pallet loader Platform/Capacity: Pallet loader platform must lift a 2000 lb MSP to a height of 50 inches above ground level for loading of MSP into the aircraft cargo compartment (via the aircraft aft ramp and ventral door). When in the lowered position for MSP transport or MSP maintenance, the platform of the pallet loader cannot exceed 20 inches above ground level. The pallet loader shall safely hold 150% of the maximum designed working load.</p>
<p>3.1.2 Towbar: A detachable towbar shall be provided to provide a means of attaching a towing vehicle for movement of a fully burdened pallet loader from the aircraft shop, across the flight line, and to the aircraft. The towbar shall be attached to the frame of the pallet loader at two points to preclude "weaving" during tow operations. A lunette eye coupler ring NSN 1730-00-110-6056 or equivalent (in size and strength) shall be attached to the towbar end enabling connection to tow vehicle at an approximate height of 15" inches above ground level. A positive-type latch shall be provided to hold the towbar in the up (vertical) position. The towbar also shall have a stop in the up position to prevent contact with the equipment item. The towbar shall be made detachable by using common hand tools.</p>
<p>3.1.3 Size and weight: The pallet loader must be no heavier than 2200 lbs (lighter is preferred), no taller than 20 inches high (in the lowered position), and no wider than 88" to allow for air transport to a deployed site.</p>
<p>3.1.4 Tie down rings: The pallet loader must incorporate tie down rings to allow aircrew to secure it to aircraft's cargo compartment tie down rings during air transport.</p>
<p>3.1.5 Casters / Tires / Wheels: The pallet loader shall have 4 swivel casters that are lockable (in at least 90 degree increments) and capable of withstanding operation over rough surfaces and hangar door tracks without causing damage to the pallet loader or casters. The casters shall support four (4) times the design working load. The pallet loader caster shall utilize semi-pneumatic wheels or wheels similar to commercial pallet dollies.</p>
<p>3.1.6 Wheel Brakes: A mechanism must be installed to prevent movement of the pallet loader with MSP, when not connected to an aircraft tug.</p>
<p>3.1.7 Platform locking feature for MSP: Platform must have a locking mechanism to prevent movement of MSP (62.5" x 108.5") during ground transport.</p>
<p>3.1.8 Platform rollers: The pallet loader platform must have rollers to allow aircrews to roll the MSP off of the elevated pallet loader into the aircraft cargo compartment.</p>
<p>3.1.9 Platform jacking mechanism: Pallet loader must have a hand operated jacking mechanism to elevate the MSP to the height of the open aircraft ramp. The platform will always remain in the lowered position for towing. The platform must have a fail-safe system to prevent inadvertent lowering of the MSP during loading and unloading operations.</p>
<p>3.1.10 Bumper pads: Bumper pads shall be made of durable, soft, non-marring material and will be securely attached to areas that would come in contact with the aircraft when properly positioned next to the aircraft for MSP loading/unloading operations.</p>
<p>3.1.11 Ground clearance: Minimum ground clearance between lowest part of pallet loader and ground must not be less than 4 inches.</p>
<p>3.1.12 Corrosion preventative coating: Materials used in the pallet loader must be protected from corrosion. If painted, paint must conform to MIL-PRF-233377 (primer) and MI- PRF-85285 (topcoat) matching FED-STD-595, Number 17925, Untinted White.</p>

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Technical and Price Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The Solicitation number is: OPM10-10-R-0002 and is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38 dated January 11, 2010.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 525120, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.
Worksite health and wellness programs have proven effective at improving the health of employees, lowering overall health care costs, reducing absenteeism, and improving employee morale and productivity.  Comprehensive health and wellness programs have resulted in returns on investment averaging $3 benefit for every $1 in cost. 
Worksite health and wellness programs across the federal government vary in scope; however, few, if any, could be considered at a comprehensive level that would constitute best practice.  The Office of Personnel Management has been directed by the President to develop worksite wellness models for the federal workforce that is on par with best practice in the private sector.
This document describes the development of a Prototype A site at a federal ‘campus’ in Washington, D.C. involving employees from the Office of Personnel Management, General Services Administration, and Interior Department working in the buildings located between 18th and 20th streets Northwest.  

OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government.  The contract will be for a period of three years (one base year plus two (2) one-year option periods).  The base period is anticipated to be 
April 12, 2010 – April 11, 2011.  Funding for the base year is subject to the availability of Fiscal Year 2010 funds.

	Offerors shall be required to provide a written proposal.  Written quotations shall be comprised of two volumes, with an original and fifteen (15) copies each, which shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 5, 2010.  Volume I shall provide technical evaluation factors 1-4, to be limited to a maximum of 90 pages, Times New Roman-11 pt. font minimum, and one inch margins on all sides.  Volume II shall provide the price/cost evaluation for the level of effort proposed in completing the work as indicated in the Statement of Objectives.  In addition, offerors shall submit one copy electronically to wellness@opm.gov by the final due date for submission of quotations.  

	Please send quotations to:
	
	U.S. Office of Personnel Management
	Attn:  John R. Dismond/Vito Bertucci
	Contracting Group, FSC
	1900 E Street, NW, Room 1342
		Washington, DC 20415-0001

Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at Wellness@opm.gov through 3:00 PM, EST, February 18, 2010.   Responses to all questions shall be posted on FedBizOpps no later than February 24, 2010.  Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.

Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is anticipated to be awarded, April 9, 2010, will not be considered.  Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov.  Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.

<DESC>These generators are to supply battery charging backup during winter months when there is not sufficient solar energy to charge the radio site battery banks at six key radio sites located on Mount Hood and the Gifford Pinchot National Forests.  The sites are critical to the radio systems operation and needed to ensure personnel safety and search and rescue during winter months.

6 self-igniting, thermoelectric generators designed to work with solar charging systems for power back when solar array is insufficient to charge the radio site.  Required is a charging capacity of 60-400 watt units, a module to monitor the battery system voltage and self start the generator when the battery voltage falls to a predetermined set point, and shut the generator down when battery voltage rises to another predetermined set point, putting the generator back into standby/monitor mode.  Should include a bench stand.  System needs to opearate in unsheltered conditions year-round.  1 year repair/replace warranty required.

<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Over the past decade, what have been the major trends and developments regarding the PRC's involvement in regional and international institutions? What is the likely course of such trends over the next 5-10 years? The report shall examine both international and regional institutions, with specific analysis as to China's role, differing approaches and strategies and goals being pursued by China in each such institution. Specific institutions to be examined could include - but would not necessarily be limited to - the United Nations, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International Settlements, the Asian Development Bank, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN+3, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China's role in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its attendant fora (Doha Round, etc.) is not intended to be a subject matter for this report.  &#61472;</p>
<p>2.	What is the status - and assessed likely future status - of the PRC seeking increased representation &amp; staff positions in these international organizations? What have been China's financial contributions to each institution and what changes are expected in the future, if any?  What has been the measurable effect, if any, of China's increasing influence on the policy of such organizations? Identify and explicate relevant examples and case studies of such developments in recent years, and assess the implications for the United States in the areas of economic, foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>3.	What evidence is there to indicate whether there might be a de facto free trade bloc forming through ASEAN + 3, with China at the center, and from which the United States might be excluded? If this were to prove true, how would this impact the U.S. economy and U.S. relationships in the Pacific region?</p>
<p>4.	Within the IMF and the World Bank, does China support conditionality for loans to developing nations, particularly those in Africa?  What role has China taken in establishing institutional policies on good governance and transparency in lending and investments in Africa?  What evidence exists to support the view that China has provided funding for development projects in return for access to minerals or raw materials?</p>
<p>5.	How does China's membership at the IMF affect the Fund's policy decisions and commentary on China's management of its exchange rate?</p>
<p>6.	The report should provide an overview of the timing and circumstances of PRC commitments to and participation in UN peacekeeping operations. What evidence exists of significant PRC economic investments or financial interests in the countries in which the PRC has committed to UN operations? What impact, if any, does a country's relationship with Taiwan have on how the PRC handles UN peacekeeping policies in response to crises affecting that nation or region?  What affect does a country's diplomatic or other relationships with Taiwan (or lack thereof) have on  the way that the PRC responds to UN requests?</p>
<p>7.	Assess the extent to which PRC engagement with international institutions may be reflective of broader strategic, diplomatic, and economic goals, and what the implications may be for the United States and other major actors in the international system.  Specific topics to be examined might include - but would not necessarily be limited to - the question of whether or not PRC-sponsored foreign aid and/or security assistance programs offered through international institutions might or might not be intended to promote specific PRC economic, foreign policy or security policy goals.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3.	The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of contract confirmation. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments.  The Commission recognizes that, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract.  The contractor, in their initial submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial review draft.  It is to be understood, however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4.	As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Coordinator shall act as a representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in the RFP. The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5.	The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6.	At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this Request for Proposal may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7.	Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant that it/he/she will perform this work solely for the Commission, and that the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8.	The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9.	After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the Contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's web site and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10.	A contractor will be expected to participate, as appropriate, in activities relating to the dissemination of a final report, at the discretion of the Commission. Briefing requests will be reasonable and will be subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1.	The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time.</p>
<p>2.	The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key issues and questions to be addressed by the report").</p>
<p>3.	The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1.	A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this request for proposals (RFP), to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project;</p>
<p>2.	A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ.  In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used;</p>
<p>3.	An estimate of the time the applicant will need to complete the required work;</p>
<p>4.	The price the applicant will charge to the Commission to complete the work set forth in this RFP.<br /> <br />Firms and individuals wishing to submit a proposal in response to this Request for Proposal must ensure that the response arrives at the following location by 5:30 PM on March 2nd, 2010 or it will not be accepted or considered.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

The period of performance 365 days. This is a follow-on effort to the current contract, FA8601-07-D-0008. Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager.

<DESC> The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around February 17, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.

1.)  The cutting to specifications of 116.7 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, at which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date, or use the materials for Forest Service projects. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
2.)  The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
3.)  The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
4.)  Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
5.)  In Units selected by the Contractor to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)  There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
7.)  Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
8.)  Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
9.)  Wood and Chips which have been stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service.

11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer's representative, (COR), will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing is present in many of the units in this project and:
H 4 Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14) Units will not be released for treatment all at one time, but instead will be released as previously worked in units have been completed. Contractor should indicate on the submitted work schedule the sequence of unit release and completion dates at the time of submission of the RFP. 
15.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts.

ITEM 120

  Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.

It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method.

The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete preparation of the area by removing from the Units all cut materials unless materials must be prepared prior to the piles being burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.

Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

<DESC>This solicitation will be changing.  

Instead of having all of the disciplines (general building maintenance, construction & carpentry, roofing, painting, electrical wiring, HVAC and plumbing services) all on the single IDIQ, the Government has decided it would be best to issue separate solicitations for each of the disciplines.  

This solicitation (AG-04T1-S-10-0006) will be for only the general building maintenance construction and carpentry.  There will be separate solicitations for each of the rest of the disciplines.  

This solicitation will be revised and re-posted along with the new separate solicitations for the other disciplines on or about March 15, 2010. Thank you for your patience.

<DESC>Contract N68936-04-D-0020 with Lockheed Martin Services is one of three Multiple-Award Contracts (MAC's) for Combat Environment Simulation (CES) support.  Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intendsto negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis an extension of the contract ordering period from March 31, 2010, to June 30, 2010.  The other two CES MAC's are N68936-04-D-0019 with Tybrin Corporation and N68936-04-D-0022 with L-3 Services Inc., Global Security & Engineering Solutions (GSES).  Contract type: Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), level-of-effort (LOE).  The extension is needed to avoid work stoppage on existing programs and orders until the award of the follow-on contracts.   Contractors who believe that they can step in and take over a program must submit a written response demonstrating technical, cost and management capability without causing hardships to program schedule and costs.  Requirements are competed among the CES MAC's and awarded and funded at the task/delivery order level.  N68936-09-R-0001 is the solicitation for the CES follow-on and was synopsized on October 21, 2009, and closed on December 21, 2009.  The anticipated date of award for the follow-on is June 30, 2010.  The CES Division at China Lake requires support to develop and acquire new range systems, integrate various range systems and upgrade and modernize existing range systems.  Specifically, there are requirements for the integration of various Test and Evaluation (T&E) and training systems into existing range systems and infrastructure; the fielding of systems at new range locations; the modification/update/upgrade of major software systems, and the development, mod! ification, or integration of supporting range systems and assets (for participants tracking, data communications, exercise monitoring, and debrief, etc.). The CES Division also requires a variety of engineering, technical and management services related to development, fabrication, procurement, integration, test, training and technical support of radar and pod instrumentation systems, Threat Simulator systems, tactical training ranges for all Department of Defense (DoD) services, related network-centric systems and components, Advanced Air Defense technological concepts, Information Assurance/Operations, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networking in a Network Centric Warfare environment.  As required by specific task orders, the contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, install, integrate, and test network-centric warfare equipment and/or systems designed to provide a dense, realistic, electromagnetic  environment to be used by the Defense community for weapon systems development, real-time aircrew tactical training, test and evaluation, test and evaluation of defense suppression systems, electronic warfare (EW) system! s, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) equipment.  Because of the synergistic nature of the CES Division's product and the thrust to emphasize commonality and joint interpretability across all Department of Defense (DoD) ranges, the body of projects executed by this division take on the look and feel of a single unified acquisition.  Level of facility clearance required: SECRET.  Level of safeguarding required: SECRET.  Contractor's interested in subcontracting opportunities contact the Prime Contractor.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.  The anticipated award date of the modification: March 31, 2010.  Questions should be addressed to Commander Code 220000D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 East Bowen Road - Stop 4105, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support; operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska. The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below. You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Period of Performance and (ii) Commercial Practices. Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired. Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted. The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force responsibilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska. Duties include (partial list) on-station management, airfield management, operations and maintenance, equipment and facilities repair and corrosion control, fire protection, power production, water treatment and distribution systems, heating systems, roads and grounds (incl. snow removal), fuels management, operations and maintenance of communications systems, weather support, and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.). The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early Spring 2010 with award in the Spring 2011 time frame, and with performance to begin on 1 October 2011. The current contract was solicited under 8(a) competition. Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement. Small businesses including veteran-owed, service disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women owned, as well as other small businesses are particularly invited to respond. The current contract was acquired under NAICS 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the corresponding size standard is $35.5M. The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether a Period of Performance of three years would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer; and if so, please explain why. The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions; however, the responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12. Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities for performing the above stated requirements and the required resources to satisfactorily perform the mission. Capability statements may be submitted to the contracting officer, Jani Faris, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506, and are requested by February 26, 2010.

In any event, the space must have potential for efficient layout, as determined by the Government agencies’ mission.  Space must be located 1) in an office, research, technology, or business park that is modern in design with a campus-like atmosphere or 2) on an attractively landscaped site containing one or more modern office buildings that are professional and prestigious in appearance with the surrounding development well maintained and in consonance with a professional image.

Additionally, general unreserved parking for visitors shall be provided as required by local code. All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the rental consideration.  Space shall not be located within a base (100-year) flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  The Government shall have access to the space 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety and Handicapped Accessibility.  The Government will have the right to install antennas on the building’s roof.  Loading dock access is required including leveler and accessibility for 18-wheeler truck delivery.  Approximately 15,000 square feet must be located on the first floor or in an area with a minimum 125 psf to 150 psf floor live load to accommodate high-density file systems.

<AWARDEE>The Boeing Company, 6200 JS McDonnell BLVD, Saint Louis, MO 63134-1939 US
<DESC>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER NAVAIR BOA N00019-05-G-0026.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded a sole-source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) task order to The Boeing Company.  Recent direction has been received by NAVAIR to conduct a flight demonstration of an F/A-18E/F series aircraft using biofuel.  This effort supports the assessment of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and subsystems for operation using a 50/50 (equal parts) mixture of jet fuel and biofuel (blends of standard petroleum-derived jet fuel such as JP-5 mixed with a synthetically derived component, anticipated to be Hydro-Treated Renewable Jet (HRJ)). Anticipating a broader use of alternative fuels in the future, establishment of a protocol for clearing other Boeing aircraft for operation on such fuels will enable estimation of work scope required to achieve that goal.  Specifically, the contractor shall:  a) define the capability of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and subsystems to operate on biofuel, support NAVAIR reviews with other system suppliers, and provide safe-for-flight recommendation by 28 FEB 2010 to support F/A-18 flight test evaluations by NAVAIR, b) identify tests and analyses considered necessary to determine the capability of all Boeing aircraft currently in Navy service to operate on fuel made from an alternate source, c) provide corporate lessons learned from commercial introduction of biofuels, d) identify data and tests required to evaluate self-sealing fuel tanks for bio-fuels use in US Navy Boeing aircraft in combat areas, e) conduct laboratory tests to quantify the dielectric constant of biofuel supplied by NAVAIR.  The effort was awarded as a firm fixed price order.  This award is based on Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies or services required are available from only one source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A 18 aircraft in its various configurations and is the only source with the knowledge, technical data, and expertise necessary to fulfill the Government’s requirements.  Points of contact for this announcement are: Contract Specialist Karen Johnston at (301)757-4224, karen.johnston@navy.mil and Contracting Officer Melanie Bateman at (301)757-6572, Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil

Certain cleaners are regulated by law and may need to be separated within the shed.<BR>21.   BEST VALUE.<BR>21.1.

Ability to deal with other people in a professional manner.<BR>b.  Past Performance.<BR>c.  Timely execution of cleaning.  Ability to meet cleaning schedule.<BR>d.  Price. <BR>22.

Such a preliminary notice will not be deemed to commit the government to renewal.
