<DESC>NAICS CODE: 541712 FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514 TITLE: Advanced Software Engineering Technologies for the Software Producibility Initiative ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-06 CFDA Number: 12.800 I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION: Background On behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is seeking white papers for Advanced Software Engineering TechnologieS (ASETS) as part of the Software Producibility Initiative (SWPI). SWPI is an ongoing program with the overall goal of improving the Department of Defense&rsquo;s (DoD's) ability to design, build, test, and sustain software-intensive systems that are large-scale, high complexity, highly reliable, and operate in relevant military environments, which meet mission critical requirements, safety critical requirements as well as exhibit predictable behavior. Within SWPI, the ASETS BAA focuses on discovering and adapting cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to the production of military software. ASETS seeks to improve the producibility of software-intensive systems that directly support the Warfighter and operate in the most demanding military environments. Producibility may be defined as the capacity to design, produce, assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity [1]. Previous efforts have provided the foundation for future work by investigating specification of complex requirements; "correct-by-construction" software development; scalable composition; high-confidence software and middleware; system architectures for network-centric environments; technologies for system visualization, testing, verification, and validation; and model-driven development approaches. The ASETS BAA is weapons-system agnostic because software cross-cuts nearly all DoD weapons systems. The ASETS BAA is seeking innovative ideas to improve the DoD&rsquo;s ability to develop and sustain software systems; the ASETS BAA is not requesting effort to perform the sustainment. ASETS research concentrations are organized by software gap areas to focus investigations on software technology and to provide solutions that are broadly applicable to many systems. Capability Gap The DoD strives for superiority in a complex operational environment composed of heterogeneous and ever-evolving pieces such as sensors and processing hardware, software, and wired and wireless communications infrastructure. To achieve superiority in this dynamic environment, the DoD invests in fully networked and maximally-capable sensors and platforms at the cutting edge of performance. Software has emerged as a key enabler of capability and flexibility in DoD systems. Software is essential to providing a vast range of military capabilities by playing a fundamental role [1] that deepens, broadens, links, and integrates diverse system elements. A pervasive DoD challenge is the production of software that provides the Warfighter superior and affordable military capability in an environment where hardware and sensor technology is rapidly advancing and systems&rsquo; performance demands are ever-increasing. The Government Accountability Office has identified the increasing scope of software development as a contributing factor to poor acquisition program outcome [2]. OASD(R&amp;E) has identified the need for advanced software engineering technology to enhance the producibility of software in this environment with the goal of speeding the delivery of affordable capability to the Warfighter and sustaining it. Specific needs are discussed in the description of Research Concentrations Areas below. Objective White papers are being solicited for innovative approaches within the concentration areas listed below. Of interest are advanced software engineering technologies that harness cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to enable production of large-scale software-intensive systems with improved quality and performance, decreases in cost and development times, automation of labor-intensive and error-prone processes, increased reliability, and easier integration and sustainment. Proposed ideas should be candidates for advanced technology development and have an established theoretical basis. Techniques solely involving management and business processes are specifically excluded, as are efforts to sustain software systems Research Concentration Areas: White papers are welcomed in the four technical areas listed below. Cross-cutting proposals are also welcome, but should be identified as such. Proposals should focus generally on technology that enables the production of broad classes of software and not solve implementation-specific problems. Technical Area 1: Distributed Processing / Multi-core Processing Investigate approaches that address the production of systems that use parallel or distributed processing. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably optimize software in heterogeneous, multi-core environments that are dynamic and continually evolving. Future growth in computing performance will have to come from software parallelism that can exploit hardware parallelism [3]. The need for robust, general, and scalable parallel software approaches presents challenges that affect the entire DoD computing ecosystem. These systems range from large, distributed processing enterprises (including clouds) to self-contained embedded platforms such as aircraft where deterministic behavior and real-time control are essential. The environments include heterogeneous processing, and diverse communications channels with characteristics (e.g., latency and packet-loss) that vary over six-orders of magnitude. The National Academy of Sciences report entitled &ldquo;The Future of Computing Performance&rdquo; [3] identifies five main challenges to increasing performance and energy efficiency through parallelism: 1. Finding independent operations. 2. Communicating between operations. 3. Preserving locality between operations. 4. Synchronizing operations. 5. Balancing the load represented by the operations among the system resources. Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: partitioning approaches that address data dependencies, data locations, algorithmic dependencies, computational dependencies, and read and write dependencies; rethinking programming models so that programmers can express application parallelism; managing asynchronous behaviors; methods for resource allocation, load balancing, data communication, and synchronization of interactions; new programming languages with appropriate compilation and runtime support; graphical design approaches; executable design specifications; transactional memory approaches; and shared memory management approaches. Technical Area 2: Completeness, Development, Testing, and Sustainment Investigate approaches that address the ability to design, produce, and assure large and complex software systems. In very large and complex systems, the DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably check for the completeness of software with respect to design, the correctness of the software with respect to domain models, the traceability of software features to requirements, and the validation of system function against rigorous sets of performance and reliability standards. A large DoD system can have in excess of 100 million lines of code, 100s to 1,000s of configuration items, and diverse implementations (programming languages, operating systems, middleware, etc.). These systems may be built by different and geographically distributed developers and require nearly continuous modification and upgrades. It is not unusual to have simultaneous, conflicting requirements (performance, real-time processing, bounded failure recovery, security, etc.) in systems that are not identified until late stages of testing or integration. Further, unanticipated errors and conditions may arise from imprecise estimations during design, possible-but-unlikely inputs or stimuli, changes in the physical environment, operator error, or novel usage. All these factors make it very difficult for the DoD to design, produce, and assure software. Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: formal specification; syntactic and semantic methods; improvements to code quality (including formal verification); scaling improvements for formal methods; representations and quantification of uncertainty and risk; innovative theorem provers and satisfiability solvers; static and run-time analyzers; model checking approaches; innovative formal methods for architectures, refinement, and change traceability; characterizations of functional and non-functional properties; integration of specification or model-based methods with measurement-based methods; improved fault-tolerance, robustness, adaptability; sampling and measurement; runtime verification; forecasting system behaviors; thresholds to alert users; control recommendations; fault isolation; runtime code replacement or modification; identification of faults induced by hardware, residual software defects, or external influences; and testing and evaluation techniques. Technical Area 3: Instrumentation and Monitoring Investigate approaches that enable quantitative and data-driven decisions about the production of software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably develop quantitative and data-driven descriptions of software that provide programmers and project leaders in Government and industry the same understanding of large and complex software-intensive systems. This gap leads to diverging or speculative assessments of project progress and system performance. It also hampers the test and evaluation community in designing and making assessments of sub-system and system performance that can clearly distinguish software performance from hardware performance. Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: instrumentation and monitoring of software and firmware with minimal invasiveness; multi-scale and multi-modal approaches such as representations, abstractions, and composition of models and measurements; integration of specification-based methods and measurement-based methods; quantification and representation of uncertainty; dynamic identification of performance metrics; and code visualization. Technical Area 4: Legacy Software Investigate approaches that address evolution and interoperability of older software with newly produced or upgraded software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably integrate newly-developed code with older code and verify system performance. This thrust is distinct from the other technical areas because it pre-supposes that the developer will encounter software that was not designed to be easily upgraded or changed. Further, this thrust is not seeking approaches that improve the ability to sustain the software in a particular system. Approaches must investigate novel techniques that could be adopted in the future to sustain many different systems. The sustainment phase of software is critical for DoD systems given the long life of these systems. Software sustainment can be characterized as either (1) the modification or correction of existing code or (2) development of new functions or performance improvements that provide increased capability to enhance weapon system relevance [4]. Further complicating the task is that systems must integrate or interoperate with older or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; systems whose code may have been written in an obsolete language, in a different context, or with different assumptions. It is prohibitively expensive to rewrite these legacy applications and &ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; them has fundamental performance limits for the distributed environment. Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: methods for extracting the architectural information, sub-components, and flow and inheritance graphs from object code; reverse engineering; identifying functional and nonfunctional requirements in legacy code; traceability link recovery; deriving interface requirements between legacy and new code; methods for conversion and refactoring legacy code into new structured programs; and alternate frameworks for the examining legacy code.

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION: 1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. All offerors submitting white papers will only be contacted via email by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission. 2.

<DESC>The DPA Title III gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon carbide (SiC) Advanced EW monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) Production Capability Project will establish a domestic, economically viable, open-foundry merchant supplier production capability for high frequency, wide bandwidth (32 - 38 GHz), MMICs employing GaN epitaxy on 100mm SiC substrates. An open-foundry merchant supplier is one whose business model makes its production capabilities available for use by external companies to fabricate chips to their own specifications. It is evidenced by the presence of a process design kit (PDK) that captures the design rules and processes in a manner that allows external users to design chips that meet their needs in a small number (preferable first pass) of design iterations.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Baby Wipes on or about<strong> April 2012,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to Baby Wipes that are hypoallergenic, alcohol-free, scented and unscented (Flip Top Soft Pak, Tubs and Resealable Soft Pak). The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $252,727 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 1 office in Portland, Oregon has a requirement for improvements to the underground 25 kV primary electrical distribution system that serves the fish hatchery facility buildings and on-site residences at, Lyons Ferry Fish Hatchery, Starbuck Washington.  The contractor shall furnish all management, supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals required for project. The following is a brief description of the work requirements for this contract:
a. The majority of the existing underground 25 kV cable has reached the end of its service life and is in need of replacement. This includes the main distribution loop around the perimeter of the facility as well as most of the tap segments that serve individual loads. The spur on the south side of the facility that feeds residences 6, 7 & 8, and the tap to the Visitors Center are the exceptions and will not need new 25 kV cable.b. The existing separable insulated connectors and associated terminal junctions in the distribution system electrical vaults and load connections points have also reached their end of life and will be replaced.c. To protect the fish hatchery electrical equipment from voltage surges and large imbalances on the incoming primary electrical service, fault interrupter switchgear will be installed between the fish hatchery and the electric utility service point. In the event a substantial system disturbance is detected by the fault interrupter switchgear, the fish hatchery will be disconnected from the utility to minimize damage to facility equipment.d. At the approximate midpoint of the 25 kV distribution loop (west end near existing manhole MH-10), sectionalizing switchgear will be installed. The sectionalizing gear, used in conjunction with the fault interrupter gear will provide a safe and convenient means to isolate and re-route power in the event a fault occurs within the fish hatchery power distribution system.e. Contractor shall be required to take oil samples of indicated transformers and send to lab for testing.f. Contractor shall be required to replace Utility Building 112.5 kva 3 phase transformer with new rebuilt and have existing rebuilt and returned to owner for future use.g. Phasing  The work will need to be performed in phases in order to minimize number of occurrences and durations of electrical service interruptions to fish hatchery. Refer to project phasing sequence.

<DESC><p>Synopsis:<br /><br />This is a notice of intent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to contract with FiberGate, Inc., 6076-C Franconia Rd. Alexandria, VA 22310; on a sole source basis to complete a dark fiber connection between FDA White Oak Campus' Cherry Hill Entrance and FDA White Oak Building 130. This requirement is a continuation of service that was started last year by FiberGate.

Now that the building is ready, FDA is now ready to connect. The existing dark fiber is the sole property of FiberGate, Inc. There is no other known existing dark fiber line between these two locations. The services required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A solicitation will be issued to FiberGate, Inc. no less than 15 calendar days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines otherwise. All written inquiries must be submitted to Tiffany Williamson, Contract Specialist, via email at Tiffany.Williamson@fda.hhs.gov no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time (ET), March 23, 2012.</p>

<DESC>Lower Sherando Dam Outlet Works Repair
<p>DESCRIPTION: The scope of work includes the base item of repair of the outfall conduit and option items for removal of the control tower structure above the intake trash rack and replacement of the manual slide gate operator with a remotely controlled hydraulically operated unit and related work including, but not limited to, disposal of the control tower debris, clearing sediment and debris from around the intake valve and trash rack, and installing a remote control panel for valve operation from shore.</p>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Weather Modeling and Atmospheric ElectricityStudies in support of the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) project.Summary:  The Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) project at NASAMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) demonstrates the utility of unique NASA observationsand research capabilities to improve short-term weather forecasts on a regional and localscale.	The utility of the products is demonstrated end users who provide feedback on thetransitioned products and capabilities.  The SPoRT project focuses on providing uniqueremotely sensed measurements of atmospheric and surface processes which are assimilatedinto initial conditions of weather forecast models or used diagnostically by end users. This activity prepares end users for future operational capabilities.Scope of Work: Provide on-site modeling and remote sensing expertise to conductcollaborative research and transition activities consistent with the SPoRT mission in thefollowing areas:Regional weather modelingo Develop and maintain state-of-the art regional forecast models for real-time and casestudy analysis in support of SPoRT initiatives  - develop end-to-end processing scripts to initialize and run advanced versions of theWeather Research and Forecast (WRF) model in conjunction with other SPoRT scientists  - modify, maintain, and investigate existing and new land surface model softwarepackages such as the GSFC Land Information System (LIS) to assimilate experimental fromNASA EOS research satellites and future Decadal Survey instruments and NOAA operationalsatellites  - conduct sensitivity studies and case study evaluations on the impact of NASA and NOAAdata using the WRF / LIS  and NASA Unified WRF (NUWRF) configurations, leading topublications in peer-reviewed scientific journals  - assist in the transition of WRF / LIS products into end user decision supportsystems.o Develop training materials on the use and interpretation on WRF / LIS consistent withother SPoRT training aids for end userso Support other SPoRT initiatives as requestedTotal lightning analysis and disseminationo Total lightning data processing and analysis from ground-based networks  - develop and maintain end-to-end processing schemes turning signals from ground-basedlightning networks into geophysical parameters leading to publications in peer-reviewedjournals,  - disseminate products to end users through established SPoRT processes and into endusers decision support systemso Develop proxy data sets for future instruments  - transition products and capabilities to end user's decision support systemo Develop training materials on the use and interpretation of total lightning informationcorresponding transitioned productso Support other SPoRT initiatives as requestedThe above activities shall be conducted collaboratively with SPoRT scientists to insureproper understanding and use of existing and new capabilities within the team and theuser community.  Activities conducted in support of these tasks must assist the SPoRTteam in sustaining unique transition to operations capabilities in the area of regionalmodeling and data assimilation and total lighting mapping.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ENSCO, Fall Church, VA, pursuant to FAR6.302-1 which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or servicesfrom only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requrements. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. ENSCO has provided weather modeling and total lightning expertise to the SPoRT for anumber of years, collaborating with international academic organizations, government andnonprofit agencies, and private firms to further integrate NASA observations into modelsand to help disseminate real-time weather data to the NWS.  This collaboration has been akey component to the success of the SPoRT program. Continuing this collaboration iscritical to achieving SPoRT program objectives.2. This procurement is a follow-on to previous activities for the continuation of weatherforecast model development activities which began with Contract NNM07AA58D and totallightning analysis and forecasting  under NNM07AD96D.  Under NNM07AA58D, ENSCO appliedscientific expertise to integrate various satellite products (sea surface temperature,vegetation fraction, etc.) into the NASA Land Information System (LIS) modeling schemeand coupled it with the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) software to demonstrateimprovement in short-term weather forecasts.  Detailed verification procedures andprograms were developed to validate improvement in the forecast model.	Under NNM07AD96D,ENSCO has used its scientific expertise to develop unique total lighting products fromground-based data that demonstrate the utility of future space-based observations andhave transitioned these data sets to weather forecast offices.	These investments inresources and expertise have contributed significantly to the SPoRT program, can noteasily be replicated in a timely or cost effective manner, and have enhanced NASAspartnership with the National Weather Service producing a more direct and effectivetransition of products to the operational weather community.  Award to any other entitywould result in duplication of costs that would not be recovered through competition andwould fail to leverage the synergy and cost savings from building on the ongoing SPoRTprogram efforts.3. ENSCO has already established a successful collaboration and paradigm with NASA andthe NWS to transition advanced weather modeling and atmospheric electricity products totheir end users and can leverage this experience as the SPoRT program continues toachieve is objective. Since SPoRT has great familiarity with ENSCO, the continuedexecution of the collaboration and paradigm will be much easier and timely in deliveringproducts to end users.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 22, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a Modification under existing Contract N00019-09-C-0059, on a sole source basis, with L3 Communications Systems, Salt Lake City, UT in accordance with FAR 6.302. This effort encompasses all of the labor and materials necessary for the recurring and non-recurring engineering required to manufacture, test, and deliver Spares for previously procured AN/SRQ-4 units with Engineering Change Notice (ECN) 181. L3 is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the AN/SRQ-4, which is the portion of the Common Data Link (CDL) Hawklink system that is incorporated into the ship. The procurement of spares for the AN/SRQ-4, with ECN 181, requires a manufacturing data package which is owned by L-3 Communications. The Government is unable to compete this requirement without the technical data for the AN/SRQ-4 (with ECN 181). Another vendor cannot manufacture Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs) level spares, with this specific AN/SRQ-4 configuration, without the technical data. As such, L3 is the only source with the technical data necessary to perform this effort. Questions regarding potential subcontracting opportunities should be addressed to Richard Derrick of L-3 at 801.594.7092.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The primary function of the buildings and facilities under consideration is to serve as federal office buildings, United States Courthouses and land ports of entry into the United States from Canada.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The court houses are active and cannot be shut down or interrupted.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Specific U.S. Marshall&rsquo;s security procedures must be followed prior to any entry or project and the time for clearance should be considered in the project plan.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Various customs, immigration, administrative and other related inspection and office space is involved.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Due to international trade and travel, concerns about contraband, security considerations, and other considerations there is equipment specific to the operations of the LPOEs present on site. This may include computers, large areas that are lighted for security purposes, machines capable of X-raying tractor trailer trucks for contraband, inspection booths, license plate readers, radiation monitors, surveillance cameras, and other equipment.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">LPOEs experience high volumes of traffic both vehicle and foot.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Many of these facilities are operated on a 24 hour- seven day a week basis.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The mission requirements of Federal Tenant agencies may limit energy reduction opportunities in some respects.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Security Clearances will also require time for processing and this should be included in any schedule or plans for site inspections or preliminary audits.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Many of the LPOEs handle both commercial and private vehicle traffic.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Due to NAFTA and increasing focus on cross border trade, drug and immigration issues, many of the LPOEs are undergoing expansion or witnessing increased traffic and use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Scope Summary:</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The intent of this project is to utilize both traditional energy efficiency projects and renewable energy to accomplish that objective.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The buildings and this project are intended to become High Performance Green Buildings as that term is defined in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">All equipment and components used shall be Energy Star certified (where appropriate) and of the highest energy or other efficiency that can reasonably, economically, and presently be obtained with current state of the art equipment. The Contractor shall be responsible for the physical installation of the improvements and equipment. The ESCO should also be knowledgeable and experienced in traditional energy conservation and energy efficiency technologies and construction methods as well as renewable sources of energy production.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">GSA is seeking to obtain highly sustainable, highly energy efficient buildings and facilities. Lighting, building envelope, Glazing and HVAC systems, and building automation control systems and programming is another area where specialized experience and knowledge is required as is HVAC and energy storage system design and thermal storage system design and operation.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">ESCOs should also have experience with facilities such as US court houses, LPOEs that have unique traffic flows and operational considerations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The successful contractor will have to be knowledgeable and capable of construction of Energy Star and LEED certified buildings and of obtaining those certifications for any facility that does not yet have them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Potential ECMs include but are not limited to renewable energy sources i.e. solar PV systems, lighting system upgrades, energy storage systems, water conservation systems, and other potential ECMs identified after the preliminary audit and consultation with the building managers and GSA&rsquo;s Energy Team (see Appendix 1, IDIQ Contract Attachment J-3) for comprehensive list.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The GSA has completed energy audits and retro commissioning studies at many of the proposed locations.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The completed studies will be made available to the ESCOs selected to submit proposals for their use, but without representation by the government as to any outcome or result relative to a project.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The contractor may make use of the reports and data, but must draw their own expert conclusions from their analysis of this data. The Government offers no representation or warranty with respect to this data.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">ESCOs are expected to conduct their own due diligence and to make use of existing study information as well as any other materials provided.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Government will not release the internal economic evaluation of the any completed studies, but will use this as part of its internal government estimate to evaluate proposed cost of the project.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">GSA expects the ESCO to propose the optimal mix of renewable and other technologies to most cost effectively serve the needs of the proposed.&nbsp; All ECMs proposed in the preliminary assessment will be reviewed by the Government (and after discussion) either included, or excluded from the proposed scope of work.</span></p>

<p>This solicitation is issued pursuant to FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Coast Guard intends to award a fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsive, responsible bidder whose written quote is considered most advantageous to the Government, both in price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers proposals and are in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance and 2) Price. Factors 1 and 2 will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. Past Performance shall be considered significantly more important than price (factor 2).<br />In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified or FAR 19.1404, if your firm is a SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer for this acquisition, please respond by email to Karen Marshall at karen.m.marshall@uscg.mil or Fax at 757-628-4934.

If two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance. A Joint Venture that cannot provide this requested information will not be considered to have sufficient documentation needed to evaluate past performance as an evaluation factor. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set-aside or SDVOSB set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set Aside or 52.219-27 or Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside will apply, which requires that at least fifty (50) percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.<br />Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232-33.

All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice<br />Compliance Review of Grant Recipients
<p>I. Background Information<br />The United States Forest Service (FS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) to obtain information on companies with the capabilities of conducting compliance reviews of federal grant recipients. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an RFP or as a decision or obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Forest Legacy Program (FLP) is authorized by the 1990 Farm Bill, which amended the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the FLP to protect environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. FLP was amended by the 1996 Farm Bill to allow for grants to the States.</p>
<p>Through FLP, the Forest Service provides grants to State agencies (typically the State Forestry Agency) to protect important forests through conservation easements (Approx. 65% of all FLP projects) and fee-simple purchases (Approx. 35% of all FLP projects).</p>
<p>As required in the FLP Guidelines, the Forest Service conducts quality assurance oversight reviews to ensure the State agency's appraisals are in compliance with the federal appraisal requirements. FS established the Quality Assurance Inspection (QAI) process to conduct such oversight reviews. To date, FS personnel have conducted the reviews using internal resources. FS is exploring the possibility of contractors conducting this function.</p>
<p>The anticipated scope of work would entail reviewing documentation, reviewing processes by conducting in-person or virtual interviews with State agency staff, reviewing files, and preparing a report of findings and recommendations focused on improving the State's processes.</p>
<p>FS seeks contractors with experience and expertise in all of the following:<br />&bull; Conducting oversight reviews in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA or "Yellow Book") and the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).<br />&bull; Completing real estate appraisals and/or reviews of conservation easements.</p>
<p>FS requires contractor personnel to have the following certifications:<br />&bull; State General Appraiser Certification<br />&bull; Certificate of Completion of a UASFLA Seminar (as student or instructor)<br />&bull; Certificate of Completion of Conservation Easement Appraisal coursework (student or instructor)<br />&bull; Appraisal Professional Designation or Accreditation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II. Sources Sought Responses</p>
<p>Vendors that meet the requirements above shall submit a sources sought response that identifies the following:</p>
<p>1. Company Name, DUNS, Website URL and Point-of-Contact.<br />2. Contracting vehicle names and numbers (such as GSA Schedule contracts) that would be eligible for use given the anticipated scope of work in Section I.<br />3. Brief descriptions of relevant work completed in the last five years that aligns with the anticipated scope of work in Section I. Please include the email address and phone number of the customer. <br />4. Any recommendations, exceptions, etc on the requirements listed in Section I.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 3 pages with the following guidance:<br />&bull; 8.5 x 11 inch paper<br />&bull; Single-spaced typed lines<br />&bull; 1 inch margins <br />&bull; Times New Roman 12-point Font</p>

Current Term:  10/1/11 - 9/30/12; Current Amount:  $629,733.55 Firm Fixed-Price (FFP)/$14,353.80 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).

    b.

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small businesses, services-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) having the capability to provide services to adjudicate pharmacy claims submitted under the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) for the Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Small Businesses with the ability to meet the staffing needs BARDA has based on BARDA's mission (both included in the description) are encouraged to submit capability statements in response to this Source Sought.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of requirement is to obtain services of a qualified vendor to perform the activities related to adjudicating prescription drug claims for medications and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and reimbursing pharmacies enrolled in the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) on the Government's behalf. This effort will allow any pharmacy in the United States and its territories to use existing electronic pharmacy systems as an infrastructure to efficiently process prescriptions and DME for individuals that are eligible for the EPAP. This effort is performed under the authority cited in Sections 403 and 502(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 USC 5170b and 5192(a). Under that authority, ASPR may issue a task order to the contractor to perform tasks under the contract at any time.</p>
<p>As part of this requirement, the government shall require that any interested offeror make available a minimum limit of $1M for reimbursements to pharmacies. This means that once claims have been adjudicated, a vendor will then submit a list of approved claims to the government, allow for the government to verify that the approved claimant may be paid, and then reimburse the list of approved pharmacy claims up to $1M. Offerors will be permitted to invoice bimonthly for the reimbursements, even if at a level below $1M, but must guarantee that they can meet the reimbursement obligation up to $1M prior to the government reimbursing them.</p>
<p>Instructions for Capability Statements:</p>
<p>In order to be able to validate a firms capabilities, responses to this sources sought should demonstrate a vendor's experience in the adjudication of pharmaceutical claims, any access to nationwide pharmaceutical networks, and any other information regarding adjudication that the vendor may have experience with. In addition, interested vendors must acknowledge and make a statement that they can commit to the $1M minimum threshold, or if they cannot meet such a threshold, what their maximum threshold would be, and state how they would plan to maintain a reserve for those finances.</p>
<p>Please do not exceed 10 pages for your capability statement. Please include your business classification and DUNS number as part of your submission.</p>
<p><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT AN RFP; an RFP is anticipated on or about the week of April 16th, 2012. This Sources Sought notice does not bind the government to release an RFP. A set-aside determination will be made based in part on the capabilities a firm is able to demonstrate in response to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement, along with a firm's capability statement referencing "Adjudicating EPAP Claims and Reimbursing Eligible Pharmacies - Capabilities" may be submitted to Brendan Miller, Contract Specialist.</p>

The Government anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $35.5 million.

Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material the contractor feels may further demonstrate their capability may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Vicksburg Contracting Office in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under the authority set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C2304(c)(1). The BPA will be issued in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. The Boeing Radiation Effects Laboratory (BREL) is the only high energy radiation facility that offers full capabilities at reasonable cost to perform the required dose rate upset testing of Radiation Hardened Microelectronics. The dose rate test requirements are summarized below: Dose Rate: Strategic dose rate &gt;5.0 E8 Rad/Second Radiation Type: e-beam (&gt;10 MeV) and bremsstrahlung (&gt;2 MeV endpoint) modes Area: &gt;85% Uniformity over 20mm x 20mm (requirement) / 40mm x 40mm (goal) Shot Rate: 50 to 300 shots per day Pulse Width: Requirement 20ns to 100ns / Goal 10 ns to 1 microseconds Dosimetry: Traceable to NIST Standards / PIN Diode beam monitors Data: High Speed Digital Data recorders &gt;10 channels Dose Rate Upset testing requires a linear accelerator (LINAC) or Flash X-ray (FXR) facility and multiple high speed data recorder channels. An optimal configuration performs initial upset screening with the LINAC in e-beam mode with anomaly investigations (e.g. circuit burnout and low upset threshold confirmation) performed with the FXR in Bremsstrahlung mode. A co-located LINAC and FXR are desired to optimize test team efficiency and eliminate delays / costs associated with travelling to another facility. BREL has a co-located e-beam linear accelerator and Flash X-Ray bremsstrahlung capability, multi-channel high speed data collection capability for testing advance microelectronics, and dosimetry traceable to NIST standards. Additional test requirements include: e-beam capability: Electron LINEAR accelerator (10MeV) with Bremsstrahlung (X-rays) and e-beam. Test area will accommodate nearly any size or configuration up to several inches per side. Max Dose Rate: &gt;5.0E8 rad(Si)/s, Pulse Width (FWHM) 10ns to 10us, Target Area Variable up to several inches/side, reproducibility +/- 5% (95% uniformity. Bremsstrahlung (X-Ray) Capability: 6.5 MeV Flash X-ray, &gt;5.0E8 Rad/sec, pulse width ( FWHM) 35ns, Target Area, 132mm x 132mm, Repetition rate: 30 to 40 shots/hr, reproducibility +/- 5% (95% Uniformity) Dosimetry: Dosimetry is achieved through the use of LiF thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) and NIST provided alanine transfer dosimeters. Two, Harshaw model 3500 TLD readers are available for use. Both systems are calibrated on a semiannual basis and are NIST-traceable. The LINAC and Flash-X-ray dosimetry and beam monitoring are done using high-speed reverse-biased PIN diodes that can be located adjacent to the test sample. BREL Instrumentation: The BREL Automated Test Equipment (ATE) Laboratory is a 1,400 ft2, class 1,500,000 clean room (per BAC 5703) that accommodates a wide range of computer controlled electrical component testers. Automated semiconductor test equipment is available to characterize most types of semiconductor components from simple discrete devices such as transistors and diodes, to complex hybrid, linear, and digital integrated circuits. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS AND NO SOLICITATION OR REQUESTS FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Interested parties have five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this Synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities. Such qualifications and/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after five (5) calendar days, or without the required information, will be considered non-responsive to this synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not conduct this effort as a full-and-open competitive procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. All inquiries must be submitted in writing to the email address or facsimile number stated herein and to the attention of Ms. Carol Anderson, Contracting Specialist. Responses to this notice must be received by 12 Noon EST, March 13, 2012. Responses must include your business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. If no responses are received, an award will be made to Boeing Radiation Effects Lab (BREL).

Notice: Sole-Source Announcement

1.	The Grand Junction VAMC, Colorado intends to negotiate sole-source acquisition with Maquet, Inc  	Getinge Group to provide services and materials to disconnect, dismantle as necessary, remove and reinstall 	in new location, Getinge-Castle Surgical Light assemblies and associated Dimmer Control equipment.  	Procurement of these services will support Activation of the new 3rd Floor Surgery Suite Addition.  Activation is 	dependent upon the relocation of all existing equipment, materials, and supplies from the present 6th Floor 	Surgery 	Department to the new 3rd Floor Surgery Suite Addition.  Relocation of existing surgery lights requires 	the 	assistance of MAQUET certified and factory-trained technicians who are familiar with MAQUET lighting 	products.  MAQUET will ensure reinstallation and functional operation of MAQUET Surgery lights meet the 	manufacturers specifications.  MAQUET will also be available to evaluate the relocated light and make any 	upgrade 	suggestions that may be necessary to insure maximum utilization of the light in its new location.  The 	equipment to be relocated as part of this acquisition are MAQUET manufactured equipment (proprietary).  Also, 	there is an unusual and compelling urgency to award this contract.  In order to activate the newly constructed 	3rd Floor Surgery Suite, MAQUET equipment must be relocated and made operable within the new facility.  The 	new 3rd Floor Addition is scheduled for Activation on Tuesday, March 27, 2012.  Immediate activation of this new 	facility benefits both the VA and its customers, the veterans.   

Importantly, the VA will be able to maintain the best level of operation for the tax-payers dollar; servicing a hard use medical system involving proprietary surgery light systems; assuring cradle-to-grave continuity of maintenance tied to equipment warranty, thus enabling the Veteran Administration Medical Center in providing the most effective care for its patients.  Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by providing a capability statement and qualification which must contain specific information on supplying this type of service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within seven (7) days after the submission date of this sole-source announcement will be considered by the Government.

<p>The purpose of this Modification 76 is to obligate $1,696.09 of ARRA funding to pay for indirect cost rate adjustments associated with one of the contractor's fiscal years that was associated with Option Period 3 of the contract. All work assignments associated with Option Period 3 of the contract expired on March 31, 2010.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation FA4877-11-Q-0247 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49, Defense Circular Number 20110202, Air Force Acquisition Circular 2010-1027. This procurement is being solicited as 100% small business set aside under NAICS code 423910.</p>
<p>Purchase the following:<br />01- (1 Each) MFR Big Toys (P/N MBT6616-1)Volunteer with two 25'x25 Bigshade integrated shades 5-12 yr old or equal<br />(The above items must also conform to the specifications stated below.)<br />Direct Connection - All components must be fastened to the uprights using bolts and a threaded insert. These inserts must be installed into factory drilled holes in the tubing of the play structure. No clamp connectors<br />Once this equipment is installed it will be left to the host nation for any care or maintenance. By using a direct connect system we are reducing the possibility of errors in maintenance by host nation personnel due to the simplicity of maintenance. Because this is a US DOD Mil install it is important that we use equipment that is safe, and above all will last years without regular maintenance.<br />Additionally all the equipment is predrilled and powder coated at the plant so assembly is free of any clamps with protruding bolts or bare surfaces that will rust. . Due to the pre-drilled no clamp assembly the protective powder coat will last decades even in the most severe environment.<br />Structure Coating - Parts must be coated using a method resistant to a highly humid, salt water environment. Components must be rust-proof with a warranty of at least 25 years. No PVC coatings on any surfaces.<br />Because this is a US DOD Mil install it is important that we use equipment that is environmentally friendly thus no PVC coating due to the fact that if they are vandalized and burned the units will not leave toxins and contamination as PVC's would.<br />Integrated Shade - Shade unit must feature at least a 25' x 25' breathable UV resistant shade fabric that provides 90% or more UV protection based on American Academy of Dermatology recommendations. The unit must be attached to playground equipment as to not violate the safety zone.<br />Due to the extremely limited space at some of the sites we need to integrate the shade structure into the equipment footprint. Safety is achieved by freeing up as much play space as possible as well as ensuring nothing is in the Safe Zone either structure. One way they do this is by attaching their canopy systems to the existing playground poles eliminating additional pole obstacles in the play area.<br />Safety - Must meet safety requirements outlined in ASTM F1487-07ae1, Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Playground Equipments for Public Use, dated 15 March 2007.<br />Self explanatory<br />Packaging - Equipment must be palletized, per equipment unit, on pallets no wider than 4' and no longer than 20' for shipping in SEAVAN.<br />Package the playground in complete color coded sets on custom made their pallets to be used side by side in SEAVANS for the long overseas cargo movement decreases shipping cost and allows for coordinating our delivery to specific sites, decreasing our build time not having to break down and identify all the parts for the different site, and ensure the safe arrival of all equipment.<br />Shipping will be FOB Destination to F5A3CE - 301 CES CARSWELL AFB Ft.

<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:<br />a. First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.<br />b. Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.<br />c. Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time.<br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>
<p>i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.</p>
<p>(Note:) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>
<p>(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.<br /><br />(xv) Quote is required to be received NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM MST, Thur, 22 March 2012. Quote must be emailed to deborah.ezop@malmstrom.af.mil or faxed to (406) 731-4005 to the attention of Deborah Ezop.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Apparel, Lab. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgery Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is February 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Apparel, Lab. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $928,782.79. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 132 of the total 135 line items account for 96.53% ($896,565.31) of the total volume in sales $ 928,782.79 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The seven requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /></span></strong>1.

A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 13 MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Efficiency of Care/Infection Control - (AAMI) PB 70:2003 and NPSG07.03.01; Implement policies and practices aimed at reducing the risk of transmitting multidrug-resistant organisms) The Disposable Lab Apparel can be donned successfully without assistance. . The Disposable Lab Apparel must have limited memory and be flexible enough to conform loosely to the clinician's body, be lightweight, have breathability.<br />2. (Clinician Safety/Infection Control - OSHA Standards 1910.132; Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards to reduce the risk of health care associated infections). The Disposable Lab Apparel must resist saturation and any penetration of liquids to maintain protection. The Disposable Lab Apparel must have barrier protection and resist saturation and any penetration of liquids to maintain sterility and protect the user as used for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to prevent strike through.<br />3. (Clinician Safety/Infection Control -Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Standards, ASTM F 1670-03 and ASTM 1671-03) The quality of construction and product strength provides barrier protection and prevents staff exposure in critical areas, seams, fasteners, ties and fabric). The Disposable Lab Apparel must have barrier protection and resist saturation and any penetration of liquids to protect the user as used for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of health care associated infection.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Apparel, Lab. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /></strong><br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><br />Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Apparel, Lab. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $928,782.79. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 132 of the total 135 line items account for 96.53% ($896,565.31) of the total volume in sales $ 928,782.79 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil 210-292-3270 and Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>

<p>Each evaluator will assess at least one sample of the product line based on the clinical requirement. The assessment will be recorded on a single evaluation form for each vendor. . A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>

(Clinician Safety/Infection Control - OSHA Standards 1910.132; Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards to reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The Disposable Lab Apparel must resist saturation and any penetration of liquids to maintain protection. The Disposable Lab Apparel must provide barrier protection and prevent strike through.<br />3. (Clinician Safety/Infection Control - (AAMI) PB 70 Level I and NPSG07.03.01) The quality of construction and product strength provides barrier protection and prevents staff exposure in critical areas, seams, fasteners, ties and fabric. The Disposable Lab Apparel must provide barrier protection and prevent strike through.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA.

However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.  GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION:   The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a solicitation electronically only.

The goal of these projects are to reduce the possibility of a stand replacing fire burning through the units with lethal consequences to the mature overstory while providing a uniform fuel bed to burn in more desirable conditions. These projects will leave the dominant, co-dominant and intermediate conifer trees intact.
<p>This solicitation is for slashing, lopping, scattering and/or piling activities on the Townsend Ranger District and/or Helena Ranger District and/or Lincoln Ranger District of the Helena National Forest and/or the White Sulphur Springs Ranger District, and/or Belt Creek Ranger District, and/or Musselshell Ranger District, and/or Judith Ranger District, and/or the Rocky Mountain Ranger District of the Lewis and Clark National Forest.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-55), effective February 2, 2012.</p>
<p>1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)<br /><br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. Questions should be received no later than ten calendar days after the issuance date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation. Even if provided in other form, on the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a LeCroy high speed oscilloscope / sampling doublers / high resolution realtime oscilloscope system.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:<br /><br />1. high-speed (analog bandwidth of at least 20 GHz) real-time serial data analyzer oscilloscope</p>
<p>2. high-resolution (true 12-bit analog to digital conversion) oscilloscope with a bandwidth of at least 400 MHz with at least 12-bits of vertical resolution and 72 dB of dynamic range on 4 different channels.</p>
<p>3. minimum of four channels of hardware acquisition capable of 20 GHz analog bandwidth at 40GS/s sampling rate.</p>
<p>4. two sampling doublers to combine two channels to achieve an 80GS/s effective sampling rate.<br />5. high speed architecture that allows for extremely fast computations on the acquired waveforms. <br />Brand Name Only Justification:</p>
<p>The CMOS Reliability and Advanced Devices Group of the Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division of the Physical Measurements Laboratory seeks to purchase a LeCroy Serial Data Analyzer 820 Zi-A high speed oscilloscope with WM8Zi-2X80GS sampling doublers as well as a LeCroy WaveRunner HRO-64Zi 400MHz high resolution (12-bit) real-time oscilloscope.</p>
<p>The high speed SDA (20GHz) oscilloscope with the WM8Zi-2X80GS sampling doublers brings the sampling rate up to 80GS/s and will serve as a key tool to facilitate the design of a balanced microwave bridge circuit which serves as the "heart" of the high-definition electron spin resonance spectrometer currently being developed. The high resolution (12-bit) oscilloscope is required to read-out the microwave bridge output for accurate data acquisition.</p>
<p>The LeCroy high speed oscilloscope / sampling doublers / high resolution realtime oscilloscope system is the only one that meets NIST's needs as it is the only one commercially available that offers the high resolution (12-bit) that NIST requires for its planned high-definition electron spin resonance research. The design of NIST's microwave bridge requires at least 12-bit true resolution in order to effect successful electron spin resonance detection.</p>
<p>NIST cites authority of FAR13.106 (1)(b) as primary rationale for Brand Name Only Determination.<br /><br />***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement. The LeCroy High Speed Oscilloscope / Sampling Doublers / High Resolution Realtime Oscilloscope System may be new or refurbished.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: LeCroy High Speed Oscilloscope / Sampling Doublers / High Resolution Realtime Oscilloscope System, comprised of the following components: <br /><br />1. One (1) SDA 820ZI-A</p>
<p>2. One (1) SDA8ZI-STD</p>
<p>3. Two (2) WM8ZI-2X80GS</p>
<p>4. One (1) WM8ZI-EYEDRII</p>
<p>5. One (1) WM8ZI-SPECTRUM</p>
<p>6. One (1) WM8ZI-PROTOSYNC</p>
<p>7. One (1) WAVERUNNER HRO 64ZI</p>
<p>8. One (1) WR6ZI-HRO-STD</p>
<p>9. One (1) SDA820ZI-T5</p>

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, business services, and lodging. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout, appearance, convenience and atmosphere of meeting space and luncheon space, and the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities including amenities to support the conference such as free wi-fi in the conference space. (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility in Houston, TX, near a major freeway/beltway/highway which provides low-cost or free parking.</p>
<p>Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on meeting room design/layout and quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities (e.g., high-speed internet, etc) and staff to support the conference. In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Each quoter shall complete the Response Form, Attachment A. which includes the quoter's pricing quotation. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for audio-visual and business services; sleeping room rates; and cost options for facility parking rates. The EEOC is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales tax in quotations for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<p>Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>Factor I -Technical Capability: a. Contract Requirements: Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to: 1. Provide all of the contract requirements regarding meeting space, food and beverage service, audio visual equipment and technical support. 2. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to the meeting space. 3. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.</p>
<p>b. Location: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area within a 5-10 minutes walking distance of a WMATA Metro Station with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, from nearby hotels, and from the local commuting area. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the facility and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>c. Availability of Dates: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance: (a). The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past threee (3) years. Contact information should include the following: Name and address of government agency or other non-government client; Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable; contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and description of services provided. List any problems encountered on each contract and the quoter's corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary). (b). In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The Government reserves the right of choice of venue should litigation/arbitration of this contract be necessary.</p>
<p>The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services - Certification with your quote. The Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government &lsquo; Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Veterans, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, Clause 52.222-37 Employment Reports Veterans, Clause 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965, Clause 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, Clause 52.222-53 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, Clause 52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving, Clause 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, and Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer &lsquo; Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<p><br />SECTION V<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (CG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the CG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific CG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the CG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Contractor shall make reasonable arrangements with the Government or Contractors of the Government, as shall have been identified and authorized by the Contracting Officer, to be given admission to the Contractor's facilities and access to the vessel(s) and to office space, work areas, storage or shop areas, or other facilities and services, necessary for the performance of their respective responsibilities and reasonable to their performance.

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the<br />specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>Invoices shall be submitted to the USCG Finance Center http://www.fincen.uscg.mil/electron_cg.htm and via email to Dorothy.rawls@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. The contracting officer will also calculate the foreseeable cost of transporting the USCG STATION WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH (UTB 41481) to offeror's commercial shipyard.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (GG-913)<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904<br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the<br />specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>Invoices shall be submitted to the USCG Finance Center http://www.fincen.uscg.mil/electron_cg.htm and via email to Dorothy.rawls@uscg.mil .</p>

To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The US Department of State (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the US and its citizens through global cooperation. INL's Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere who produce and transit narcotics. INL/WHP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts; develops and revises drug and crime strategies, and coordinates program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>INL/WHP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other United States Government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Treasury, and the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this position is to provide an INL Coordinator to the Narcotics Affairs Office (NAO) at the US Embassy in San Jose. The Coordinator advises on the implementation of bilateral and regional USG and Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) projects. The Coordinator oversees the acquisition/budget, travel/training, and effective prosecution/safe community functions/programs by supervising the Locally Employed Staff (LES) who have responsibilities within these areas.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Coordinator will report to the Narcotics Affairs Officer or an assigned delegate. As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the Coordinator receives only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities and the Coordinator negotiates the draft scope and project objectives independently with little direction from the supervisor.</p>
<p>Since the position is located physically in San Jose, the Coordinator will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review NAO/INL programs throughout Costa Rica.</p>
<p>B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />A. Knowledge Specific<br />1) Provide senior-level advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAO/GOCR citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law programs</p>

This purchase agreement expires in June 2012, so a new contract vehicle is needed to buy additional licenses.

<p><br />Please find the&nbsp;attached Industry Forum&nbsp;flyer containing&nbsp;registration details and instructions for attending the&nbsp;Industry Forum scheduled on 22 March 2012. <br />The Industry Forum previously scheduled for Tuesday, 27 March 2012, as reflected in this Request for Information (RFI) #2, is changed to Thursday, 22 March 2012. All other information reflected in the RFI remains unchanged. Registration instructions will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities Website. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <br /><br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING SERVICES</span> (NAICS 541330)<br /></strong>To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM requirements. Requirements for CONUS regional suites will include SRM projects. Requirements for worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects.

<p><strong>Request comment from interested parties to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>
<p>5. As previously noted, some CONUS projects may be issued against the worldwide contracts. What would your recommended project parameters include (i.e. "X" dollar value, "X" project type) to move a requirement from a regional CONUS contract to the worldwide contract?</p>
<p>6. There is a potential to establish only three regions (i.e. East, West and Central) for the CONUS Engineering Services efforts. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about your firm's capacity to cover large CONUS regions?</p>
<p>7. Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>
<p>Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm; size of business; point of contact and telephone number, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, classification standard i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, etc, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment on the US Army RFI for Future Airborne Capabilities Environment (FACE) Reference Common Operating Environment (COE), originally posted on 22 Feb 12 and amended previously on 28 Feb 12, is to publish the following submitted Questions (Q) and Answers (A), along with an additional note regarding response requirements: <br><br>(1)  Under the referenced Response Requirements section, please ask the contractors to also include a technology roadmap that describes the path for the proposed hardware and software environment to obtain safety and security certifications necessary for airworthiness approval.<br><br>(2)  Q. The subject RFI says, responses (to questions) will be directed to all participants.  What defines the list of participants?<br>A.  All questions will be consolidated in an amendment to the RFI on ASFI, so that anyone wanting to participate has all the information.<br><br>(3)  Q. Is this a new effort or was there a previous contractor that fulfilled similar requirements in the past?  If the latter, would you be able to inform me of the: Contractor Name, Contract Number, Value, Expiration Date?<br>A.  This is a new effort; no contractor is incumbent.<br><br>(4)  Q. Can information be provided on only one portion of the RFI; specifically, the Graphics package aspect of FACE TM?<br>A.  We are really interested in a complete response, but there is no reason that we could not accept responses from teams if a contractor only wants to respond to a portion of the request. <br><br>(5)  Q. Would you accept a multiple LRU solution to the FACE TM reference COE with a roadmap to a single LRU solution?  In other words, does the referenced One (1) bus-based computing hardware platform mean a single LRU solution?  Multiple LRU solutions that are flight worthy exist today that meet your hardware requirements.<br>A.  The government is requesting information on a single computational node to use as a lab-based asset.  The government will not levy a requirement for a specific number of LRUs.<br><br>Q.  The embedded power supply is requested to be 28VDC.  May it be a MIL-STD-704 specified AC voltage, such as 115Vac/400Hz? Or possibly wall power for the initial units?<br>A.  The government will accept an external power supply or power conditioner to provide 28VDC from standard wall AC power.  A MIL-STD-704 specified AC voltage is acceptable such as 115Vac/400Hz power.<br><br>Q.  What FACE graphical services are necessary?  Are you planning to use OPENGL, ARINC 661, and ARINC 739?  Are you using a specific display and/or ARINC 661 server?  Must the solution support all three graphical services or is compliance achieved by supporting just one.<br>A.  The government does not have specific requirements for a particular graphics service implementation. Any graphics service implementation that is conformant with the FACE standard will be acceptable.<br><br>Q.  How many FACE COE units do you require?<br>A.  One (1).<br><br>Q.  What FY and quarter are you planning to start development?<br>A.  3rd Quarter, FY12.<br><br>Q.  Do the Guest RTOS versions need to be hosted by an ARINC 653 OS?  Could it be a separation kernel OS host acting as a hypervisor rather than an ARINC 653 host?<br>A.  The COE solution shall be capable of running at least two alternative, FACE-conformant, RTOS, one of which shall be ARINC 653 conformant and one of which shall be POSIX conformant.<br><br>Q.  Can the requirement for the referenced one (1) card with four (4) computing resources be met with four (4) individual processing cards or a multi-core (quad core) processor?<br>A.  Combination of multiple cards to achieve a total four computing resources is acceptable.  A single partition should utilize a single processing unit.  The government does not prefer multi-core processors.<br><br>(6)  Q. The RFI states, II. FACE TM conformant software implementation consisting of a minimum of: (1) ARINC-653 Operating System; (2) Two (2) different guest Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) hosted in the ARINC-653 Operating System; ARINC 653 has no notion of  the referenced guest RTOSs or of hosting other OSs. Can you please clarify the requirement to host guest RTOSs in the ARINC 653 operating system?<br>A.  The COE solution shall be capable of running at least two alternative, FACE-conformant RTOS, one of which shall be ARINC 653 conformant and one of which shall be POSIX conformant.<br><br>(7)  Q.  Why is there a requirement for the referenced One (1) 28V embedded power supply considering the requirement to use referenced Commercial-grade hardware?  Are these not conflicting requirements?<br>A.  The government will accept an external power supply or power conditioner to provide 28VDC from standard wall AC power.<br>  <br>Q.  Can the referenced One (1) card with four (4) computing processors requirement be met with processing cores within one (1) CPU or is this four (4) physical CPUs?<br>A.  Combination of multiple cards to achieve a total four computing resources is acceptable.  A single partition should utilize a single processing unit.  The government does not prefer multi-core processors.<br>   <br>Q.  Does AMRDEC envision any specific RTOS to meet the referenced Two (2) different guest Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) hosted in the ARINC-653 Operating System requirement?<br>A.  No.<br><br>(8)  Q.  How can one get in on the FACE consortium and also, in responding to the referenced white paper, it is mentioned that a Face Technical Standard has been released. Can you tell me where I can download this document in order to answer the white paper requirements?<br>A.  The link below has been verified.  A person must "create an account" to execute the (free) download of the FACE standard: www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/c122.htm

You will need your DUNS number and CCR MPIN in order to log in to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The solicitation and associated information and the plans and specifications will be available only from the FOB website on-line at https://www.fbo.gov/ . FOB is a web-based dissemination tool designed to safeguard acquisition-related information for all Federal agencies. Interested bidders/bidders must register with FBO before accessing the system. FBO registration requires the following information: 1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN), 2) DUNS Number and CAGE Code, 3) Telephone Number, 4) Email address. Registration instructions can be found on the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf. Reference paragraph 4.4 of the Vendor Guide for instructions to retrieve the specification and drawing documents for this project. Bidders who have registered with FBO must access the data for this solicitation by way of the link issued with the solicitation. Additionally, to view and/or download Export Controlled Materials, a company must be certified (via an approved DD Form 2345) by the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS). This certification establishes that a company is a U.S. or Canadian contractor eligible to receive unclassified technical data that is under the control of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND). Questions about this program or DD Form 2345 should be addressed to U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS), Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084; or telephone (616) 961-4358, toll free (800) 352-3572; or email <br />jcp-admin@dlis.dla.mil. Once a company is certified with the JCP office (3 to 5 business days), the company should contact FBO to have them add their JCP number to their FBO account. When the Vendor click's to open an export controlled package/document, they should be asked for their MPIN. After entering the MPIN, the export controlled package/document should be viewable/downloadable by Vendors that have gone through the JCP process. If a Vendor still has problems, the Vendor should check to make sure that their CCR registration and MPIN are valid and up-to-date. If problems still persist, the Vendor may call the FBO help desk at 866-606-8220, selection option 2 for FBO issues, and ask for troubleshooting assistance. Bidders cannot log into the FBO home page and search data. This solicitation is a competitive bid and there will be a formal public bid opening. DISCLAIMER: The official plans and specifications are located on the official government webpage and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source. Amendments, if/when issued will be posted to https://www.fbo.gov/ for electronic downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the bidders responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation. Websites are occasionally inaccessible due to various reasons. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for a bidders inability to access the documents posted on the referenced web pages. The Government will not issue paper copies. All inquiries must be in writing, preferable via email to the persons specified in the solicitation. All answers will be provided in writing via posting to the web. Place of performance is 125th Fighter Wing, FANG Road, Jacksonville, FL 32218. <br />

<DESC>This amendment is the formal request for proposals.<br /><br />All offerors competing for the issuance of a BOA will be required to submit a Technical, Past Performance, and Cost Volume. The cost volume will be for informational purposes only and will be used to help facilitate future Task Order (TO) awards should a BOA be awarded after evaluation of submissions. Issuance of BOA's will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in the formal solicitation N68335-12-R-0050 attached. A basic ordering agreement is not a contract. Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions of the BOA.<br /><br />Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for proposals leading to award of orders. Evaluation factors for award of specific orders will be based on factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Specific orders will be competed among those firms issued a BOA. <br /><br />Under this BOA program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on TO's for requirements. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities Page website (http://www.fbo.gov) and the Naval Air Systems Command Business Opportunities Page (https://webadmin.navair.navy.mil/navair/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=OpenSolicitations) for new entrants once a year or at intervals that will guarantee adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement. <br /><br />The labor mix and estimated man-hours of direct labor for performance will be determined at the TO level. The total estimated ceiling over the 5 years for ALRE installation and support services is $49,407,934. The approximate range in value of orders is expected to be $1500 to $3.64M. The foreseen average number of orders per year is 16. <br />

<DESC>Below are questions and responses to industry questions.

1. Should we provide info on both the 3kw and the 5kw systems?  Will these be acquired under a single acquisition or two, or has that been determined yet?

ANSWER: please provide info on both; this will be one acquisition.

2. There is only one passing mention of solar collection, is there any guidance on how much is any solar collection the systems should handle?

ANSWER: Not at this time; please provide whatever you consider appropriate. 

3. Is the LTT that the 5kw system is to be installed on a
government-supplied or vendor-supplied item?  If the latter, would a LTT-FE(extended bed) unit be acceptable?

ANSWER: the LTT is GFE.
 

4. Is the generator (3, 5 or 10kw TQG) a government-supplied unit?

ANSWER: the generator is GFE.

5. In the specific requirements for the 5kw system, it says the system must interface with 3kw and 10kw TQG's.  It also says the system will be installed on the LTT with a 5kw TQG.  Is this to say it should work with all three TQG's?

ANSWER: the primary unit is the 5KW; however, the system must interface with the others.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Request for Proposals (RFP) &nbsp;for an anticipated five-year, cost plus fixed-fee award, with two-year base and three-year option periods. &nbsp;The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of a firm to set up and manage the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Program to meet management information needs in order to make informed management decision, as well as to shape the longer-term strategic direction and decision making of the USAID/Guatemala Economic Growth (EG) Office and other USAID/Guatemala offices upon request. The primary objective is to provide M&amp;E services that furnish continued performance monitoring, verification, and impact evaluation of projects results, including regular periodic reviews of specific activities.&nbsp; The contractor will also monitor environmental compliance of USAID mission-wide programs and activities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This M&amp;E program will not replace the M&amp;E systems that other USAID partners use in their programs. Rather, it is intended to standardize, collect and disseminate the results (indicators) as a means to centralize and assess progress towards achieving USAID's Development Objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The M&amp;E program will provide activity-level monitoring and evaluation services designed to provide qualitative and/or quantitative analyses and reviews of specific Mission activities and programs.&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The project components will include the following: (1) Develop statistical tools for baseline, mid- and final-term data collection; (2) Local capacity building of Guatemalan institutions in monitoring and evaluation, including data collection of key indicators; (3) Clearinghouse for monitoring and evaluation developed and implemented (e.g., Management Information System, Geographic Information Systems, Mission-wide environmental compliance, and other M&amp;E services); (4) Impact and performance evaluations, cost-benefit analysis and assessments conducted and results reported; and (5) A flexible component for conducting monitoring and evaluation services for other technical offices upon request.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Due to these tasks and the need of this M&amp;E Program to conduct field surveys of&nbsp;&nbsp;beneficiaries, communities and local organizations, as well as random field verification of the activities conducted by other USAID implementers, a close collaboration will be required between the implementers' M&amp;E systems and the overall USAID/Guatemala Economic Growth Office M&amp;E Program. Also, the M&amp;E Program should partner or sub-contract with local private and public organizations engaged in data collection, constructing indicators as well as monitoring and evaluation programs.</span></p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Highmark Medicare Services, Inc. under the current contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0001Z in the amount of $21,494 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<p><br />2. NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a limited source acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6. "Limited source" in this case pertains to the award of a logical follow-on task order for the continuation of DFISS III systems support in TSO-CS.

This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949</p>
<p><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE:</p>
<p>The DFISS III Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were awarded in April 2007 to fullfil a continuing need for DFAS system support. DFAS IT Shared Services provides DFAS with software and technology support. IT Shared Services supports the DFAS mission and other selected outside customers. The implementation of DFAS standard systems requires project and program management support, analytical, technical, and programming support as well as the writing of programs to support database administration. Due to varying systems at each site, several types of abilities are required for the required tasks. Systems analysis skills are required for a variety of languages and processes. Technical analysis of hardware platforms including mainframe, mid-tier, as well as personal computers, is also needed. This Task Order will provide DFAS IT Shared Services with contractor support for the following tasks/systems: Infrastructure Engineering, Release Management (Oracle Repository), Configuration Management (CMIS), Contingency Operations Reporting and Analysis Service (CORAS), Systems Inventory Database (SID), DFAS Corporate Database (DCD), and DFAS Corporate Warehouse (DCW). In addition, there may be support required for other TSO-CS systems, but this option under the Task Order will only be used if required by the government.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 1 March 2012 through 31 Jan 2013.</p>
<p>The estimated dollar value is $718,776.70.<br /><br />4. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The DFISS III BPAs were awarded just so the activities requiring these services could depend on the consistency of one company for a period of five years. The BPAs were competed and awards were based on best value factors including technical experience, past performance, management, staffing, and cost/price. Per FAR 8.405-3(a)(3), all new requirements will be initially competed between the four BPA holders. The BPA terms specified that subsequent awards for the same services will not be recompeted, but logical follow-on orders will be awarded after a determination of satisfactory performance has been made.</p>
<p>In this case, HP is the incumbent. HP currently has a staff of approximately 12 people. This staff supports numerous systems for TSO-CS and DFAS. TSO-CS relies on the staff for their technical qualifications and system knowledge and cannot risk the personnel disruption of a recompetition every year. The primary reason for establishing a five-year BPA with the understanding that follow-on orders would be awarded was to avoid the risk of the learning curve, as well as improving staff retention. One of the subfactors in the BPA evaluation was staff retention.</p>
<p>The DFAS Corporate Database (DCD) serves as the DFAS shared data environment for migratory initiatives, including: global edit tables, departmental reporting, cash accountability, and disbursing. The DCD-Non-Standard Area (NSA) will serve as the Data Migratory Point for all incoming and outgoing data prior to posting to the DCD Proper. The DCD phased process will re-direct the flow for existing system interfaces through one or many DCD-NSAs for migration, conversion, and cleansing prior to posting in the form of a standard transaction process for each business area within the DCD. This process will significantly reduce the required functionality of each migratory system as well as time, cost, and risk involved in development. The DFAS Corporate Warehouse (DCW) serves as the shared resource to support Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Managerial Reporting. The Contingency Operations Online Reporting and Analysis Service (CORAS) is a subset of the contingency data supported by the TSO-CS. CORAS reporting will provide a reliable cost of war and other financial information to the DOD decision makers. The primary source of data for the CORAS is the DCD. <br />Contractor support is required to assist DFAS-TSO/CS in the design, development, integration, project planning, testing, release management, configuration management, review, implementation and on-going support of these systems through various system development activities.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE</p>
<p>The award of the initial task order for TSO-CS was competed between the four BPA holders on a best value basis. Electronic Data Systems (EDS) now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC (HPES) was awarded that order. Per the terms of the BPA, a logical follow-on will be awarded.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY</p>
<p>The market survey for the BPA competition revealed numerous companies with potential capability for these services. The BPA RFQ was posted on GSA e-Buy for all qualified companies to consider. Five quotes were received. Four BPAs were awarded. The BPA holders have included numerous small and small disadvantaged businesses in their portfolios to use in conjunction with their own capabilities.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS</p>
<p>This order is allowable to be issued on a limited-source basis based on the satisfactorily performance of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the BPA. Initially all FSS 70 schedule holders were provided fair opportunity to establish a BPA. In turn, all BPA awardees were then given a fair opportunity to be considered for the initial task order. The use of a logical follow-on is justified because the same work is continuing and there is a continuing need for contractor support. The inclusion of priced options was not considered viable since the Statement of Work is updated from year to year which results in different numbers of hours per labor category. The SOW changes from year to year are within scope of the base year, in that as some system work is minimized, other systems may be bolstered.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION (Efforts to obtain competition)</p>
<p>See Paragraph 6 above. The BPA awards were competed and resulted in pricing below the GSA schedule; then, the initial task order awards were competed between the BPA holders resulting in further reduction in rates. The BPA instructions notified the holders that subsequent task orders for the same services would not be recompeted, but that logical follow-ons would be awarded.</p>
