<DESC>Subject service is being acquired as ITC-PAC Research Project for "An Investigation of Alternative HMIs for Tele-Operation and Supervisory Control of Robotic Land Vehicles under Simulated Motion". We will award the University of Adelaide as sole source contractor. Nature of this contract is a grant rather than a normal contract. Initially, we tried to make a grant IAW 10.U.S.C. 2358 and 31 U.S.C. 6304. However, we found out that our contract writing system at overseas did not allow making a grant.

<SUBJECT>Technology Transfer Opportunity in Field Testing of a 100kW Maritime Hydrogen Fuel Cell Generator
<SOLNBR>17_472
<RESPDATE>032017
<CONTACT>Bianca Thayer, Email bkthaye@sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, a government-owned/contractor-operated entity, is seeking one or more partners to aid in the continued development of large-scale (50-150 kW) hydrogen fuel cell power generators for maritime use.  Sandia is seeking an organization to cooperatively demonstrate the technology on a barge or vessel, or at a port, dock, wharf, terminal or other maritime-related location and provide information about the user experience.  The effort will be supported by the US DOT's Maritime Administration and the US DOE's Fuel Cell Technology Office.<br />
<p>Through previous efforts, Sandia National Laboratories and its partners have developed a 100 kW hydrogen fuel cell generator as a diesel genset alternative.   The generator has zero emissions and eliminates pollution from diesel power generation with higher fuel efficiency especially at part-load operation.  It is packaged in a self-contained, moveable 20-foot shipping container.  Real-world deployments are needed to verify whether use of the hydrogen fuel cell generator can save operation, maintenance, and fuel costs compared to traditional diesel-powered gensets.  If chosen as the deployment partner, your organization will receive this generator to be tested on your property for 6 - 18 months (flexible, based on needs).  The advantage to you is the opportunity to lower your emissions, receive information and training related to hydrogen and fuel cells, and gain familiarity with new technology. Sandia Labs will provide technical expertise to assist in your evaluation and potential adoption of this new type of generator in the future.</p>
<p>To achieve the most effective results, the host organization should:</p>
<p>&bull; Have a need for power varying from 10 kW to 100kW on a barge or vessel, or at a port, dock, wharf, terminal or other maritime-related location.<br />&bull; Be able to contribute to project costs either through direct funding or third-party grants.</p>
<p>NOTE:  A host organization can be any organization that has a maritime location, ranging from businesses to Port Authorities, Maritime Academies and other Institutions of Higher Learning, to non-profits, etc.  Familiarity with hydrogen and fuel cells is not a requirement.<br />Expertise to be supplied by Sandia Labs includes:  fuel cell and hydrogen technology; safety, codes and standards; and training.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by March 20, 2017 to:</p>
<p>Bianca Thayer at Sandia National Laboratories, MS 9056, 7011 East Avenue, Livermore, CA 94550, email bkthaye@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include organization and contact information as well as a detailed description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and where your funding would come from.</p>
<p>Selection of the partnering organization will be by May 1, with placement of the generator in summer 2017.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

To the extent that this contract is for<br />services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of<br />this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims<br />covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in<br />accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />12. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT<br />Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract without<br />further recourse to the other and mutual release of any further obligations.<br />13. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE<br />a. The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs c. and d. below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate<br />this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(1) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any extension;<br />(2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (however, see paragraph b. below); or<br />(3) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (however see paragraph b. below).<br />b. The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under paragraph a. 2. and a. 3. above, may be exercised if the<br />Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer)<br />after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />c. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the<br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will<br />remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue<br />the work not terminated.<br />d. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without<br />the fault or negligence of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to<br />perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />Examples of such causes include:<br />(1) Acts of God or of the public enemy<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />(2) Act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity<br />(3) Fires<br />(4) Floods<br />(5) Epidemics<br />(6) Quarantine restrictions<br />(7) Strikes<br />(8) Freight embargoes<br />(9) Unusually severe weather<br />e. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the<br />NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information,<br />and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has<br />specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting<br />Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />f. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and<br />Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for<br />the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The<br />NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the<br />NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />g. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations<br />of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />h. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided<br />by law or under this contract.<br />i. This contract is automatically terminated for the convenience of the government in the event the NAFI is<br />dissolved.<br />14. CHANGES<br />a. The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make<br />changes within the general scope of this Contract in any one or more of the following:<br />(1) If the requirement is for supplies and/or services: drawings, designs, or specifications; method of<br />shipment or packing; description of services to be performed; time of performance (i.e., hours of the day,<br />days of the week, etc.); place of delivery or place of performance of services.<br />(2) If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures): specifications<br />(including drawings and designs); method or manner of performance of work; NAFI-furnished facilities,<br />equipment, materials, services, or site; and/or directing acceleration in the performance of work.<br />(3) If the requirement is for transportation services: specifications; work or services; place of origin; place<br />of delivery; tonnage to be shipped; and/or amount of NAFI-furnished property.<br />b. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any<br />part of the work under this Contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer will make<br />an equitable adjustment in the Contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and modify the Contract.<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />c. The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt<br />of the written order; however, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting<br />Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the Contract.<br />d. If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the<br />Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.<br />e. If the requirement is for architect-engineer or other professional services, no services for which an additional<br />cost or fee will be charged by the Contractor shall be furnished without the prior written authorization of the<br />Contracting Officer.<br />f. If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures), the Contractor shall notify the<br />Contracting Officer in writing within seven (7) days of the occurrence of any event that the Contractor<br />considers a change to the Contract that has not been authorized in writing signed by the Contracting Officer.<br />The Contractor will be deemed to have waived any right to an adjustment if timely notice is not provided to<br />the Contracting Officer as required herein. For purposes of this clause, "event" shall include, but not be<br />limited to, an order or direction by a NAFI or other Government official, a contested contract interpretation,<br />interference with or interruption of the contract work, or any other event that increases the cost or time to<br />perform the contract as compared to the cost or time that would be required if the Contractor performed the<br />Contract in accordance with its terms.<br />g. Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a "claim" under either the "Claims" or "Disputes Resolution"<br />clause of this Contract; however, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the<br />Contract as changed.<br />15.
