<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Regional Office, St. Petersburg, Florida intends to procure services to identify communities in Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama associated with the fishing industry.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act (and the national standards contained therein, particularly National Standard 8), the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), and Executive Order (EO) 12898 ("Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations") require that social impact analyses and assessments be conducted when federal agencies propose new regulations.  In turn, these analyses require the use of social and cultural baseline data for the participants in each fishery, including descriptions of the for-hire, commercial, and private recreational fishing sectors.  Little to no baseline social and community data have been developed to aid in the preparation of fishery management plans and amendments.  The paucity of information on fishing communities in the Gulf of Mexico region is lessened only slightly by sporadic studies conducted in the region.  Unfortunately, much of this research was either not designed to address specific policy issues and problems, typically examined only a single coastal community and/or, in most cases, is not current.  As a result of the latter, such research did not take into account current definitions of certain key terms which now exist as a result of the Sustainable Fisheries Act and research guidelines that have been developed in response to such.  Without the ability to identify fishing communities and describe their participation in the region's fisheries, assessments of social impacts on these communities due to new regulations cannot be conducted with any confidence.
The proposed work will provide an overall assessment of future needs for identifying fishing communities and their levels of dependence upon or engagement in fishing to meet the requirements of National Standard 8.  This project will be conducted for the state of Texas, Mississippi and Alabama.  Activities associated with the following tasks are expected to commence in September 2002 and be completed in April 2003.  Task 1:   Obtain, read, and become familiarized with the MARFIN grant report, "Defining and Identifying Fishing Dependent Communities: Development and Confirmation of a Protocol" (Jacob, et al., 2002) and the methodologies employed therein.  Task 2:  Obtain current (2000) Census data for all places/locations identified in the list to be provided with the request for quotes.  Such data should include the following: population, educational attainment, marital status, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, industry, commuting to work, income in 1999, poverty status in 1999, value of owner occupied housing units, monthly rent, age, sex, race, ethnicity and home ownership.  Task 3:   Obtain NMFS landings data files (logbook and dealer reports) and dealer, commercial and charter/headboat permit data files for 2000/01 regarding Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama fishermen and ports.  Task 4:   Obtain Texas', Mississippi's, and Alabama's commercial and recreational fishing license data, and Alabama's trip ticket data for 2000/01.  Task 5:  Obtain NMFS data on processors in Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama for 2000/2001.  Task 6:  Compile data from tasks 2 through 5 into a general database.  At the project's conclusion, this database will be organized at the "community" level (refer to task 8).  This database must be in Excel, Dbase, SPSS, or SAS format.  Task 7:  Conduct on-site visits using Rapid Assessment Procedures and conduct review of local phone book listings for appropriate types of fishing industry related businesses or operations, as noted in the project design, in each place identified in the location list.  Summaries of the rapid assessments, including phone book reviews, will be added to, or placed in a separate datafile that can be easily merged with, the file created in task 6.  Task 8:  Using information obtained from tasks 6 and 7, determine geographic boundaries of the potential fishing communities.  Task 9:  Using the community boundaries established in task 7, place all available data into a GIS format.  This data should then be used to generate maps of all potential fishing communities that would display their boundaries and their characteristics in a visual manner (e.g. pie charts to visually display the occupational or age distribution of that community).   Task 10.  Generate a project report (in Word Perfect or MS-Word) that provides: a list of all potential fishing communities in Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, a socioeconomic description of those communities using the various secondary data, a summarization of the rapid assessments for each community, and a detailed explanation of how all communities and their boundaries were identified.  This explanation should clearly show how the employed methods and results are consistent with National Standard 8 and the theoretical/empirical literature regarding the definition and identification of communities.  Two CDs will be provided, with each containing copies of all compiled datasets and the final project report. Offers will be evaluated upon the following technical evaluation factors: (1)  First-hand knowledge of and demonstrated familiarity with fisheries and communities in Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama; (2)  First-hand knowledge of and demonstrated familiarity with the commercial, for-hire, and private recreational sectors of the fishing industry; (3)  Demonstrated familiarity with theoretical and/or empirical literature regarding sociological and anthropological research on communities; (4)  Previous sociological/anthropological research experience in identifying and/or profiling communities; (5)  Previous sociological/anthropological research experience regarding fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico; (6) Demonstrated ability to use GIS software and provide research results in such format
(7)  Experience in accessing and using Census data that can be used to identify and/or profile communities; (8)   Demonstrated familiarity with various legal mandates and agency guidelines that frame NMFS' social regulatory impact analyses (e.g. Magnuson-Stevens/Sustainable Fisheries Acts, EO 12898, NEPA, Guidelines for Social Impact Analyses, etc.).  This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.   The NAICS code is 541720.  The small business size standard is $6,000,000.00.  This purchase will be made under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the RFQ shall submit a request in writing to the attention of Sharon Clisso at the address listed above.   Please reference RFQ number WC133F-02-RQ-0162SKC.

<DESC>The previous synopsis is modified to clarify the definition of opportunities for subcontracting opportunities by replacing the sentence which begins with --To help identify potential subcontractors and  partners with the following language: "USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone small businesses and service-disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses in this activity as prime contractor or Subcontractor in accordance with part 19 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns.   In addition,  Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) (which includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs); and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) that have been identified as such by the U.S. Department of Education) should be included in your effort to seek subcontractors/partners. All selection evaluation criteria being found equal, the participation of such concerns may become a determining factor for selection. Organizations are encourage to indicate whether they are Small Businesses, Small Disadvantage Businesses entities, MSIs, etc., when requesting the solicitation and may indicate that they do not wish to be included on the list.   The other terms and conditions of the prior synopsis remain the same.
