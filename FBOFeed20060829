<SOLNBR>06ER73-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>090606
<ARCHDATE>08292007
<CONTACT>SARAELLEN STEPHENS CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487379     scstephens@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Discipline, has a requirement for a PANalytical X-Pert Pro MPD Theta-Theta X-Ray Diffraction System. The system must employ direct optical encoding in the Goniometer to ensure that possible physical wear of the gearing over the lifetime of the instrument has no effect on the accuracy of the system in positioning. Should the operator bump the tube or detector arm, momentarily changing its position, the system shall automatically reposition the tube and/or detector arm to the previously set position. A solid state linear detector must be available that employs Real Time Multiple Strip technology with over 100 active strips covering an angular range of at least 2 degrees 2 theta, have a count rate capability of up to 4,000,000 x-ray counts per second, have a minimum peak linearity of 40,000 x-ray counts per second and this linearity must increase with scan speed to at least 120,000. Maximum background noise must be less than 0.1 counts per second. This solid state linear detector must have a functional scanning range of 0.5 to 160 degrees 2theta, and optionally allow static measurements.  This detector must be maintenance free with no gas flow, gas replacement or wire replacement required and must operate at room temperature. The detector must utilize pre-aligned, fast interchange mounting frames made of hardened tool steel and remounting of modules must be reproducible to < 3 microns. Interchange of each assembly must occur in less than 2 minutes by persons who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics and without the need for any realignment of the goniometer or optics modules. The exchange of the modules must be accomplished by the loosening and tightening of one screw using one tool.   The detector shall be able to withstand direct x-ray beam exposure with no damage to the detector. A monochromator that works specifically with this solid state linear detector must be available.   The detector must be available for delivery concurrent with the diffractometer system delivery and have been available for sale for a minimum of two years.   The solid state, linear array, position sensitive detector, shall be capable of collecting diffraction data from 0.5 degrees to 161 degrees 2theta, in under 8 minutes, while measuring a FWHM of no greater than 0.29 FWHM for certain peaks on a LaB6 NIST standard. The X-ray tube must be able to be rotated from line to point focus (and vise versa) without disconnecting any water lines or power supply to the tube and not require alignment after switching from line to point focus and vice versa. Tubes must be able to be changed in 15 minutes without the need for optics realignment.  Interchange between sample stages must occur in less than 2 minutes without the need for realignment.  The system must include a sample spinner, which utilizes a top reference sample holder mounting. The mechanism must place the sample holder precisely in the diffraction plane and not be susceptible to "wobble" as the sample spins.  The spin rate must be computer controlled. A sample changer for use with the sample spinner must be provided. It must accommodate one removable 15 position sample magazines and be mounted on a locking mechanism to enable the device to be rolled clear for exchange of sample stages. Removal and re-positioning of the sample changer must occur without alignment of the changer, optics, sample stage or goniometer.  Installation shall include a minimum of 2 days of on-sight training. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the system specified as a sole source from PANalytical Inc., 12 Michigan Drive, Natick, MA 01760, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required system or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response shall include at least five past performance references of vendors you have sold functional equivalent system to,  literature, brochures, and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  Past performance references shall include vendor name, point of contact, phone number.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.   The NAICS Code for this requirement is 334516.  All information shall be sent to the attention of Sally Stephens at U.S.Geological Survey, MS152, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20192 or faxed to (703)648-7367.   ALL QUESTIONS shall be submitted electronically via email to scstephens@usgs.gov and shall state "06ER73-NoSolicitation" in the subject line.   Phone inquiries will not be acknowledged

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to AC NIELSEN, INC, 150 N. MARTINGALE ROAD, SCHAUMBURG, IL 60173-2408, USA.  The FDA's supermarket scanner data is collected on actual sales of food and dietary supplement products in supermarkets and convenience stores in the U.S. The data can be aggregated on a weekly, monthly, seasonal, or annual basis.  The FDA needs weekly scanner data to estimate the impact of our regulations.  Weekly scanner data are the only source of this information.  The FDA's risk assessments estimate exposure to various hazards based on the number of pounds of a category of food consumed.

C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation #GS-04P-06-EXC-0162 ? Orlando, Florida, GSA Contracting Officer Bernice Jackson, phone number -404-331-4616 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented designers and architects to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 to 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service).  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, security requirements, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards. All projects will be LEED certified.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: - The project is a modernization of an existing Federal Building and Courthouse.  It is located at 80 North Hugley Avenue, Orlando, Florida.  This project will be a model workplace and a model of sustainable design.  It will incorporate cost-effective and innovative strategies to meet EPACT 2005 energy goals to reduce energy consumption.  It should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building while supporting the quality and life of the neighborhood and the adjacent court complex.  The Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) project delivery method will be used. 

SCOPE OF WORK: - The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design  (CAD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and construction phase services for the existing Federal Building and Courthouse modernization project .  The project includes the demolition and construction of new interior finishes and related systems, and associated site development.  Space alterations include the following planned actions:  After selective demolition, interior lobbies at the building core on all levels will be renovated.  Restrooms will be upgraded to current Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  Significant tenant space alterations will be made at all levels of the facility including both basic office space renovations to meet a diverse mix of tenant agency requirements and special space needs such as bankruptcy courtrooms and chambers.  New provisions in the existing facility will be made to accommodate tenant special systems including telephone, data, audio visual and security requirements.  Existing windows will be removed and replaced with insulated glass.  Plumbing, HVAC, fire protection, fire alarm systems, electrical distribution and lighting systems will be replaced or upgraded.  The design of windows and mechanical systems to be replaced and/or upgraded will cost-effectively meet EPACT 2005 energy goals to reduce energy consumption.  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including LEED certification, adherence to the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, Art in Architecture, and customer agency requirements.

In addition, the scope of this project includes the following: assessment of the building?s potential eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  As of this announcement, this property has not been evaluated for eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  Prior to initiating design, as part of the Prospectus Development Study described below, the A/E Team shall retain a Preservation Consultant, knowledgeable in mid-20th Century Modern architecture, and familiar with National Register criteria and the Secretary of the Interior?s Standards for Rehabilitation, to assess the potential eligibility of the structure using the GSA Eligibility Assessment Tool (go to www.gsa.gov/historicpreservation > Historic Preservation Library > Modernism > Growth, Efficiency & Modernism:  GSA Buildings of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s). Should the building be determined potentially eligible, the Preservation Consultant shall assist the Team in identifying significant elements of the building?s original design contributing to its potential eligibility and assist the A/E in developing an appropriate contextually integrated design for this project that avoids adverse effect on those contributing elements, as outlined in 106 Compliance for Buildings Under 50?A/E Scope Clauses (go to www.gsa.gov/historicpreservation > Project Management Tools). The assessment of eligibility and design approach shall be coordinated with GSA?s Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

For all major projects (prospectus-level) receiving design funding in FY07 and beyond, GSA requires spatial program Building Information Models as a minimum requirement for submission to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner.  GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies?spatial program validation and beyond?at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges.

PROSPECTUS DEVELOPMENT STUDY (PDS):  - Prior to commencement of the design phase, the selected A-E will develop a Program Development Study (PDS) for the project.   The PDS serves as the technical foundation for the project?s construction authorization/funding request (the Construction Prospectus).  The PDS provides the foundation of GSA?s A/E Scope of Work.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is located within Region 8 ? a six state region which encompasses North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana.  It includes a single-story interior renovation with minor exterior work.  The building currently houses multiple federal agencies, so sensitivity to ongoing federal operations is imperative.

The project involves the renovation/tenant improvements of approximately 11,000 square feet of interior space for a future federal agency tenant.  This design phase will consist of planning, preliminary design, and construction document completion.  Consideration may be given to future Contract Administration services depending on funding, quality of design, and design services.

Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of Authority Cited:  A federal agency has located within Region 8 and it?s operations are of a classified nature.  There is a restriction on who has a "need to know" and limiting the access to facilities associated with those operations.  The National Security issues are such that all personnel involved with the design and construction of this facility must hold an active Secret Personnel security clearance.  The future Contractor and all subcontractors having access to the project drawings and specifications must also hold active facility clearances at the same level.  Any significant breach of security or disruption of operations in the GSA Property Development Group would compromise national security.  GSA has constantly sought to minimize the number of people who have a need to know anything about the GSA Property Development Group and the facility, capabilities and functionality therein in an effort to minimize the possibility that information could be compromised.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a tenant improvement project within an existing federal building in Region 8. The facility will be designed in English units. 
  
Description:  A federal agency has a requirement to design and renovate an existing building with various functional capabilities within GSA?s Region 8 ? a six state region encompassing North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana.  The renovation consists of approximately 11,000 square feet of existing space within an existing building.  The design criteria, performance specifications and functionality of this space is classified at the level of Secret.

The proposed project includes:
?	Demolition of existing walls, ceilings and partial building HVAC and electrical within the approximate 11,000 square feet of rentable space.
?	Developing client program requirements of the future federal agency.
?	Developing programming and preliminary design efforts to verify client requirements for their space.
?	Developing construction documents for bidding purposes of qualified construction firms.
?	Design an emergency back-up power system for the specific agency space.
?	Design an independent, dedicated telecommunications system for the specific agency space.
?	A-E Designer(s) are to follow Publication No. 64 (05/2001) for Construction Requirements .
?	Design a secured facility for the GSA Property Development Group as programmed by the future agency representatives.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to GSA?s  PBS P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.

<DESC>The NRC is currently evaluating the acceptability of allowing the use of polyethylene piping in safety-related portions of low pressure service water systems.  A specific nuclear plant has indicated plans to submit a license amendment to allow replacement of degraded carbon steel portions of piping in these systems with polyethylene piping.  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is also pursuing the development of Code Cases to accomplish this goal.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

The NIAID has a requirement for the development, optimization, qualification, and validation via Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (21 CFR Part 58) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) (21 CFR Part 211) of product-neutral immunological assays, potency assays, and animal efficacy models for the evaluation and assessment of plague vaccine candidates based on F1 and V antigens.  These immunoassays and animal models will be developed under GLP and GMP and in a manner that will support licensure of a plague vaccine under the FDA ?Animal Rule,? (21 CFR Part 601.90-95).  

NIAID will require that a minimum of two species of reproducible animal efficacy models shall be developed and characterized for both the pneumonic and bubonic forms of plague, one of which shall be a small animal model and the other a NHP model.  Innate and adaptive immune responses shall be analyzed and from these, correlates of protection shall be identified.  The development and subsequent validation of immunoassays associated with the correlates of protection includes the identification and provision for adequate amounts of standardized reagents for subsequent studies.  NIAID will require that potency assays be developed, characterized, and validated.  Once validated, these immunoassays, potency assays, and animal models will provide important tools for researchers and manufacturers, and therefore, reagents, methods, and procedures must be transferable.  This effort will become a crucial part of a joint Government Agency effort to develop and license a plague vaccine for both military and civilian needs.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year period of performance beginning on or about September 10, 2007.  In addition, the contract will contain multiple options for the establishment of Central Reference Laboratories and a fourth year of performance for completion of these optional requirements if exercised.  The total estimated effort anticipated is 25.8 FTE for the base portion and a total of 15.0 FTE for the all options.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.   This RFP will be available electronically on or about September 12, 2006, and may be accessed on FedBizOpps.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.   No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5616   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Security Management Division intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the services of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Shared Service Provider (PKI SSP). Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)  established policy for a common identification standard for Federal employees and certain contractors.  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1 implements the Directive by defining the overall technical requirements for Personal Identification Verification (PIV), the foundation of the  common identification standard or PIV card.  All Federal agencies, including EPA, must be fully PIV-compliant, including technical specifications, components and processes required for PIV interoperability, by October 27, 2006.  In order to meet the requirements and objectives of HSPD-12 and FIPS  201-1, the Agency has initiated the EPA Personnel Access and Security System (EPASS).  This system will establish a compliant credentialing program that encompasses the full set of badge life cycle activites while enhancing the security of EPA employees and personnel, facilities and Information  Technology (IT) systems. One of the key components of the Agency's EPASS Badge (PIV Card) is the implementation of the FIPS 201-1 Authentication Certificate.  From September 2006 to October 2008 EPA will issue approximately 26,000 PIV Cards that will only require the Authentication Certificate as  described in FIPS 201-1.  Pricing for this implementation model should be geared to providing 6,000 Authentication Certificates with a three-year lifespan each six months during the two year timeframe listed above until complete.  EPA is not currently interested in any additional certificates and  requests.  Certification of the PKI SSP by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and placement by the General Services Administration (GSA) on the Approved Products List (APL) is required.  Pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) direction, all procurements  related to implementation of HSPD-12 must be made using GSA's Schedule 70 and the APL. The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible business whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the  government.  Any firm believing it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a quote, which if received by close of business September 11, 2006 will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Valen Wade, Contracting Officer at  wade.valen@epa.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for a Partial Conditional Survival Approach for Modeling the Time-Varying Association between Breast Density and Breast Cancer Risk, with Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Statistical  Coordinating Center for the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, Center for Health Studies, 1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98101-1468.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.

The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) pooled database currently has information on over 6.5 million mammograms taken on 1.9 million women associated with more than 38,000 breast cancers. One of the many breast cancer risk factors of interest is breast density. Breast density changes over time, but it is not clear whether a breast density measurement from 10 years ago would be as predictive of current breast cancer risk compared to a more recent breast density measure. A better understanding of the relationship between these types of risk factors and breast cancer risk will help improve assessment of breast cancer risk and the need and timing for preventive therapy.  A recently proposed, partial conditional survival model for longitudinal data, such as the data collected by the BCSC, has been designed by Zheng and Heagerty (2005). This model is to be applied to the BCSC data to help analyze collaborative research projects that are in the queue at the BCSC Statistical Coordinating Center at Group Health.  Group Health, BCSC will develop a series of models using the Zheng and Heagerty partial conditional survival approach for modeling breast cancer risk as a function of time-varying covariates observed in the BCSC data and using these models to analyze data for the two proposals currently in the queue. This will require developing a scientifically plausible, but flexible, model for the association between breast density and breast cancer risk that changes over time, age, and menopausal status. Group Health, BCSC will need to derive the estimating equations for this model and program the fitting algorithm. Once this model is developed, the BCSC will be able to easily apply it to other proposals that use a cohort design to study breast cancer risk.   

The Statistical Coordinating Center at Group Health of the BCSC is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they are the only research group that has obtained and has access to the longitudinal data of women and mammography data.  This project requires access to risk factor data over time to perform this type of time-sensitive analysis and to NCI?s knowledge, only the Statistical Coordinating Center at Group Health has this data in the U.S and can thus fill this role for the government.  The specific analysis requires the time of a dedicated statistician with expertise in survival analysis who is familiar with the BCSC data and its collection at the sites located throughout the U.S.  The goal of this project is to develop a scientifically plausible, but flexible, model for the association between breast density and breast cancer risk that changes over time, age, and menopausal status that will be monitored through monthly progress reports.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by September 12, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to verify all questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) intends to procure on a sole source basis TgAb presence and Tg concentrations in human serum using a sensitive and specific RIA on iodine deficient subjects from Health Research Association, 1640 Marengo St., Los Angeles, CA 90033.  Gastric and esophageal cancer are two one of the leading causes of death in many countries around the world.  The NEB conducts intramural research in the areas of nutrition and cancer, genetics and cancer, and cancer prevention.  The NEB is currently examining the hypothesis that iodine deficiency is associated with the risk of upper GI cancer.  To estimate iodine deficiency thyroglobulin (Tg) testing is required, using the most sensitive and specific method available.  Only <= 50 microliters of serum is available fpr each sample and all samples shall be screened for thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb).  The laboratory should have demonstrated sensitivity cutoff at or below 1 microgram/liter for Tg.  Health Research Association is the only contractor known to the NCI Researcher that meet the requirements described above and has demonstrated the ability to measure serum thyroglobulin concentrations accurately when the concentration is at 0.5 micrograms/liter.  There is very little serum available which was collected in 1985 from subjects in China who have been followed since that time, and therefore, the serum is irreplaceable.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 12, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The Johns Hopkins University, 516 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD  21205 for the continued laboratory services to assay samples for duplicate 1-OHPG using immunoaffinity chromatography and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy.  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials, such as tobacco smoking, red meats cooked at high temperature such as grilling and broiling, and certain industrial processes, such as foundry work.  Substantial exposure to PAH also can occur from inhaling diesel exhaust.  PAH exposure has been linked to increased risks of a variety of cancers, including esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers.  It is important to identify the chemicals in these lifestyle and environmental risk factors that may increase cancer risks.  As part of their studies DCEG investigators are further exploring the association between PAHs and gastric and colorectal cancer by comparing urine markers of PAH exposure between cancer case subjects and non-case subjects from a large cohort of women in Shanghai, China.  These investigators will estimate PAH exposure in 1,200 urine samples (25 esophageal cancer cases, 150 gastric cancer cases, 250 colorectal cancer cases, and 775 controls) via measuring 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG), a urine metabolite of PAHs.  The results of this assay need to be adjusted for urine creatinine, to avoid errors resulting from dehydration or over-hydration of the study subjects.   The 1-OHPG assay was developed at Johns Hopkins University and they have the unique expertise and extensive experience in conducting this specialized assay, which is critical for providing high quality results and insights in the interpretation of the results.  In addition, this laboratory has conducted 1-OHPG analyses in several NCI studies of gastrointestinal tumors, including esophageal and stomach cancer and colorectal adenoma, a precursor to colorectal cancer.  In order for results of the current study to be comparable to the previous studies, and for future pooled studies for more refined analysis, it is imperative that the proposed 1-OHPG assays be conducted in the same laboratory to minimize laboratory variations.  JHU is the only vendor known to the OEEB that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 7, 2006. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541380.     Size Standard $11M.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP),  plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Southern California, 2250 Alcazar St., Los Angeles, CA  90033 to examine the associations and interactions of GST polymorphisms with lifetime physical activity and cruciferous vegetable intake on risk for early onset breast cancer for women participating in the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast CFR).   The questionnaire used to obtain information on recreational physical activity in the Breast CFR is one that the University of Southern California (USC) developed for the California Teachers Study.  In most BCFR centers this questionnaire was adopted in exactly the same form as was used in the California Teachers Study.  The questionnaire provides data on the number of hours per week a woman engaged in exercise activity during specific age periods of her life.  It also permits the woman to indicate the number of months per year she engaged in this activity.  Information is collected separately for activities with moderate energy expenditure and for activities that are classified as strenuous in terms of their energy expenditure. The USC will develop this lifetime physical activity score for all women participating in the Breast CFR study ?Glutathione S-transferase polymorphism, Behavioral Lifestyle Factors and Premenopausal Breast Cancer Risk.?  Dr. Leslie Bernstein who is a leader in research on the impact of physical activity and breast cancer risk at the University of Southern California and her colleges are uniquely qualified to perform the work outlined in this contract.  The University of Southern California has developed several questionnaire approaches to obtaining information on women?s lifetime histories of exercise activity for use in studies with interview data collection and studies with self-completed questionnaire administration.  Their self-administered questionnaire was used by the majority of participating centers in the Breast Cancer Family Registry project.  The USC has created an approach using this questionnaire which provides information on lifetime (or through age 54, depending on respondents age) recreational physical activity overall and for strenuous and moderate activities separately.  This approach will provide detailed estimates of hours/week/year at various time periods in a woman?s life.  With their unique background USC is the only known source to the NCI Researcher that is able to develop the analytic variables on recreational physical activity using the Breast Cancer Family Registry database.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 12, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>This is a Broad Agency Announcement for applied research in accordance with FAR 35.016. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS), Office of System Development (OSD), has a requirement for on-site capability to develop Enterprise Architecture Alternatives and Enterprise Architecture Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) Studies. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Firm fixed price proposals are hereby requested under Solicitation No.  NEEK-0000-6-00279, and no further written solicitations will be issued.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541710, size standard 500 people.

Background:

The U.S. Government (USG) Department of Commerce?s (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) primary mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth?s environment, issue severe weather warnings, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation?s economic, social, and environmental needs.  This mission requires continuous capabilities to utilize our observation systems to collect, acquire, process, archive, disseminate environmental data and information, and to provide information services.  These data are acquired on an extensive spatial range (global, regional and local) within a variety of time scales (seconds to days) to meet a multitude of user requirements. These data include, but are not limited to: hemispheric imagery; cloud and precipitation parameters; atmospheric profiles of temperature, moisture, wind, aerosols and ozone; surface conditions concerning ice, snow and vegetation; ocean parameters of sea temperature, color and state; solar conditions and space environment; and global communications.  These data are critically needed for: 1) severe storm and flood warnings; 2) tropical cyclone (hurricane reconnaissance and warnings); 3) hydrologic forecasts and water resources management; 4) ocean surface and internal structures forecasts; 5) medium range forecast outlook (out to fifteen days); 6) solar and space environmental forecasts; 7) aviation forecasts (domestic, military, and international); 8) ice conditions forecasts; 9) seasonal and inter-annual climate forecasts; 10) decadal-scale monitoring of climate variability; 11) long-term global environmental change assessment; 12) environmental air quality monitoring and emergency response; 13) fire and volcanic eruption detection and analysis; and 14) short-term and mesoscale forecasts.

To meet requirements and accomplish NOAA?s mission, the current collection of observing and data systems perform three major functions:

?	Earth Observations: Measurement, acquisition, processing and dissemination of Earth observation data from the atmospheric, land, ocean and space environment. 

?	Data collection, processing, archive and dissemination:  Receipt, storage and redissemination of data from all data collection platforms necessary to fulfill NOAA?s mission.

?	Data Products and Warnings:  Continuous relay and dissemination of environmental data to distributed users, independent of other system functions.
 
NOAA?s current baseline architecture includes 86 environmental observing systems gathering over 300 environmental observing parameters. NOAA has land-, sea-, air, and space-based observing platforms and also accesses international, national and commercial data.  NOAA?s data handling systems include 59 stovepipe systems that address 23 data management functions.  Future observing system collectors will be capable of increased resolution and vastly increased data volumes will need to be archived and efficiently accessed by an expanding number of users. NOAA must also migrate from this current stovepipe environment to an information enterprise. 

Description of Requirement: 

The Government desires to research complete end-to-end system architecture options that assess the infusion of new or existing technologies that may enhance performance and reduce costs. Respondents are encouraged to propose innovative methods to meet the performance requirements and provide cost benefits.

The Proposal must address at least one of the four Task Areas, but not more than two of the following Task Areas:

1.	Task Area 1:  Assess/Score/Rank.  This task area seeks a methodology and identification of potential tools to assess/score/rank the over 300 environmental observing parameters.  It also seeks to understand the methodology that can be applied to assess/score/rank alternative architectures. 
2.	Task Area 2:  Functional Allocation of Environmental Observing Parameters to Platforms.  This task area seeks a methodology to determine the functional allocation of over 300 observing parameters to platform types, i.e., space-based, air-based, land-based, etc.  
3.	Task Area 3 ? Data Management.   This task area seeks a methodology to streamline NOAA?s 59 ?stovepipe? data management systems satisfying 23 data management functions.  
4.	Task Area 4 - Data Integration.  This task area seeks to apply improvements to the integration of environmental data from multiple sources and to streamline and improve efficiency in the production of data and information products and services.  This task area also seeks to understand methods of addressing our future enhanced sensor collection capabilities, i.e., NPOESS and GOES-R. 


Evaluation and Basis for Award:

The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be based upon:


      (1) The Respondent?s performance and experience on similar enterprise architecture and        
            AoA efforts (45%)

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking quotations for Tate Concore 1250 Access Flooring with Positile Holes for the National Computer Center (NCC) at headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland.  SPECIFICATIONS: Vendor shall supply 1200 square feet of Tate Concore 1250 Access Flooring as well as Sealbond 95 Pedestal Adhesive.  This is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 321918; size standard is 500 employees.  For non-manufacturers, suppliers must offer products manufactured by a small business and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 ? Acquisition of Commercial Items and Subpart 13.1 ? Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  All shipments associated with the purchase order award shall be on an F.O.B. destination basis only.  The resulting purchase order number shall appear on all boxes, containers and cartons.  The time of delivery shall be no later than 120 calendar days from the date the contractor receives the purchase order award from the Government.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued on or about August 29, 2006 under solicitation number SSA-RFQ-06-1799.  The solicitation and any related documents for this procurement will be made available to interested parties through electronic media for downloading via the internet at Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The flooring shall be Name Brand Only.  Tate access flooring has always been utilized at SSA?s NCC.  Other brands are not compatible with existing flooring and could not be used to create a safe environment.  Tate Concore 1250 cement filled Positile are manufactured with four (4) holes that are used with exclusive carpet tiles that lock into place using buttons.  This eliminates the need for using adhesives to install carpet tiles.  Tate Concore 1250 cement filled Positile is also used with a heavy duty bolted stringer system also made with heavy duty pedestal heads.  Concore 1250 also has the convenience of bolting down to the stringer system eliminating the need for special security screening in offices.  This is essential in the NCC's high security environment.

<DESC>The Selective Service System (SSS) has a requirement for the award of a single firm, fixed-price contract for the redesign/migration of its existing mainframe systems to a Microsoft Windows based operating environment. This migration method must employ a strategy of redesigning/rewriting CICS/COBOL online/batch code as object oriented ASP.NET/VB.NET real-time applications and redesigning/rewriting the inefficient manual batch JCL/COBOL applications to automated native Microsoft applications(.NET/SQL Server 2005) that process data in real-time. The strategy must also include migrating of all the stored data from necessary flat files and SYSTEM 2000 tables to an open and scalable Microsoft SQL Server 2005 relational database.  The new system must have real-time processing capabilities and dramatically reduce if not completely eliminate all of the manual staff interaction previously required to process incoming and outgoing data. The CICS screen-based applications that currently produce batches of modifications to the data must be converted to real-time processing browser-based applications. The new system must be robust and able to scale up or down as the Agency?s needs dictate. The new solution must be designed and developed to meet all Federal Information Technology Requirements (Clinger Cohen Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, etc.) and allow for the seamless integration of stringent security measures for protecting and tracking access to sensitive information that meet the current (per OMB Memorandum M-06-16, FISMA, NIST, etc. ) as well as future federal mandates for the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Good  â€“ Proposal demonstrates good understanding of the objectives and approach  and has a good probability of achieving most of the requirements of the  objective.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will significantly benefit  the government. Fair  â€“ Proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the objectives and  approach and has a fair probability of achieving some of the requirements of  the objective.  Proposes an acceptable solution with few or no strengths. Poor  â€“ Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of objectives and approach  that has little probability of achieving the objective.  Proposes a less than  minimally acceptable solution.  This criterion assesses whether the approach is technically sound and/or innovative, if the methods are appropriate, and whether there are clear project  goals and objectives. 2.	Project costs  The Cost Realism area will receive a narrative rating.  A cost benefit analysis  of the offeror(s) Grant Proposal will be performed on the cost.  This analysis  will consist of the following areas, which are all of equal value, (1.) Cost  and (2.) Quality of Cost Share. This criterion evaluates the budget to determine if it is realistic and  commensurate with the project needs and time-frame.  B. Review and Selection Process 1.	Technical Review Applications meeting the requirements of this solicitation will undergo a  technical review.  Technical review is conducted by a minimum of three  independent reviewers. Each reviewer will individually evaluate and score  proposals using the evaluation criteria provided in Section V.A.2.  This review  will generally involve individuals in the field of science, engineering,  technology and/or mathematics from DoD organizations. The technical reviewersâ€™  ratings will be used to produce a rank order of the proposals.  The Government  intends to award one (1) grant on a best value basis. C.	Selection Factors The DOLC Director may review the ranking of the proposals and recommendations  of the technical review panel and make recommendations to the Selecting  Official. The average rank order from the review panel will be the primary  consideration for the Selection Official in deciding which of the new proposals will be recommended for funding to the Grants Officer on a best value basis.  However, the Selecting Official will select proposals after considering the technical reviews and recommendations of the DOLC Director.  VI.	Award Administration Information A.	Award Notices Successful applicants will receive notification that the application has been  recommended for funding to the DOLC Grants Office. This notification is not an authorization to begin performance of the project. Official notification of  funding, signed by a Grants Officer, is the authorizing document that allows  the project to begin. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified that their  proposal was not selected for recommendation.  B.	Administrative  The Department of Commerce Pre-Award Notification Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements contained in the Federal Register notice of December 30,  2004 (69 FR 78389) are applicable to this solicitation. Limitation of Liability In no event will DOLC or the Department of Commerce be responsible for proposal preparation costs if these programs fail to receive funding or are cancelled  because of other agency priorities. Publication of this announcement does not  oblige DOLC to award any specific project or to obligate any available funds. C.	Reporting Grant recipients will be required to submit financial and performance  (technical) reports. All financial reports and performance (technical) reports  shall be submitted to the DOLC Grants Officer and to the DOLC Director.   Electronic submission of performance reports is preferred. All reports will be  submitted on a quarterly schedule and must be submitted no later than 30 days  following the end of each quarter from the start date of the award. The  comprehensive final report is due 90 days after the award expiration. VII.

<DESC>--The RFP issue date is changed to: on or before 9/8/2006.--
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08556 for full and open competition for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  The purpose of the awarded contract(s) is to provide public health practice, scientific, research and technical services in support of epidemiology, surveillance, prevention, intervention and laboratory programs to the NCBDDD.  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08835 will be issued as an 8(a) small business set-aside. The particulars on the 8(a) set-aside will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees. The RFP is anticipated to be issued in approximately 30 days.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities

The mission of NCBDDD requires a broad spectrum of surveillance, epidemiologic, research support,   prevention, intervention, and laboratory services related to public health, the environment and human genetics.  The nature, scope and complexity of the scientific and technical services needed to support these activities vary from project to project.  Some projects are international in scope, recognizing that public health and environmental issues have no borders.  NCBDDD requires services such as would normally be available from an in-house scientific and technical staff.  These individuals are skilled in epidemiology, child development, health education, communication and promotion and surveillance relating to adverse reproductive outcomes, disability, environmental hazards, and natural and technological disasters.  Task orders will require personnel with diverse skills in statistics, research design, literature review and analysis, public health practice, surveillance, biostatics, GIS, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental exposure assessment, informatics, data management, clinical  and laboratory methods, data analysis, policy analysis and assessment, formative activities, conducting program assessments, conducting evaluation studies, performing data abstraction, clinician reviews and coordination and assistance in program management,  providing scientific and technical support, preparation of IRB and OMB packages, serving in partner and community liaison roles, training development and presentation, and multi-site activities.

1.	Surveillance Systems Support 
??	Background analyses & syntheses
??	Formative planning 
??	Process evaluation
??	Outcome and/or impact Evaluation

<DESC>-- The RFP issue date is changed to:  on or before 9/8/2006.--The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08835 as an 8(a) small business set-aside for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available in about 30 days only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

?	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
?	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
?	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.	Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.  

b.	 More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)  Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)  Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(4) Develop web-based, CD-ROM, or other electronic based training programs for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (5) Adapt existing materials for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (9)   Develop and implement a plan for promoting the training materials/program

         (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD?s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.

Description of Service:  Third Party Logistics Services (3PL) services required to source, acquire, provide, and sustain a broad range of support equipment National Stock Numbers (NSNs) spanning the 97 FSCs for which the Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) is responsible.  The contractor shall be required to maintain a flexible and cost effective means of providing the items, which is responsive to the fluctuating needs of our customers and compatible with the socioeconomic goals of the Government.   This multiple-year contract is contemplated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) which includes Award Term Options, terms for pricing and adding items, and Performance Based Logistics Services (PBLs).  There will be a three-year basic period of performance with options of up to five additional years, for a total potential period of performance of eight years.  The options will be awarded, individually or in combination, contingent upon continued availability of funding and the contractor?s success in meeting the tiered PBL goals outlined in the contract.  The 3PL provider will be required to provide items to the Government, on demand, within the cost and delivery requirements of the contract.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).     We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release        August 06
Industry Day             September 06
RFP Release              October 06
Contract Award           May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.     RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.     The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.     All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).     This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).     Each simulator has no motion.     Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.     The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.     The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.     The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.     Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.     Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.     The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).     The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.     It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.     The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.       A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.     The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.     The courseware was developed using Authorware.     Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)     TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.     Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.     The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.     At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.     There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.     The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.     At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.     Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.     Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.     The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.     Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.     Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.     TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.     The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.     Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.     Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.     It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 has been posted in the Business Opportunities section of the following NAVAIR Orlando TSD website:

http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD  


COMMAND AIRCRAFT CREW TRAINING (CACT) PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE C-40 AIRCRAFT

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy's Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for Navy C-40A (Boeing 737-700C with increased gross weight (IGW) as configured for U.S. Navy) aircrew.  

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level "C" or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "C" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

For all courses, the contractor shall provide: All the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-40 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-40 Pilot Initial Course.  Pilot Recurrent training will be broken into 3 distinct tracks identified as follows:  1.) Pilot 1 Recurrent Training will be a Copilot refresher-training course; 2.) Pilot 2 Recurrent Training will be an Aircraft Commander Upgrade training course; 3.) Pilot 3 Recurrent Training will be a currently qualified Aircraft Commander recurrent training course.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

<DESC>Request for Information
Plastic Card Delivery System
August 29, 2006 


THIS IS A CORRECTED RFI UNDER THE SAME BPD-RFQ-06-002 SOLICITATION NUMBER.  The mission of the Bureau of the Public Debt is to borrow the money needed to operate the federal government, account for the resulting debt, and provide reimbursable support services to federal agencies.  The Bureau of the Public Debt is located in Parkersburg, WV, and requires information about hardware, software, cabling, and supplies to automate the mailing of plastic cards and correspondence.

INFORMATION BPD DESIRES FROM VENDORS:
The contractor shall furnish all hardware, software, and cabling (hereinafter referred to as the System) necessary to read alpha-numeric serial numbers, six digits or more, preprinted in Code 39 (3 of 9) barcode on the face of 3 1/2 by 2 1/8 inch plastic cards, 30 mil thick; serial numbers will also appear in Verdana typeface, no smaller than 9 point font.  Serial numbers may or may not be in sequential order, and they will be positioned horizontally at the bottom.  The human readable serial number will appear on the lower left of the card with the barcode immediately to its right.  The System will use the serial numbers to extract matching name and address records from a data file, and will laser print personalized carriers.  The plastic cards will be affixed to the carriers with removable adhesive, one card per carrier.  The System will verify that the serial numbers appearing on the card/carrier units match, and carriers will be folded, inserted into window envelopes, sealed, and stacked for mailing.  In-line envelope metering is desirable, but not required.  System must accommodate continuous operation eight hours per day, five days per week; longer periods of operation may occasionally be required.  The System will be used for mailing an estimated 20,000 cards per month.  
Accuracy of card/carrier matching is vital, and each envelope produced for mailing must contain a single card with its matched carrier, referred to below as the package.  When misassemblies occur, System must either stop at the point of the error or divert the package so that it does not interfere with subsequent processing.  System must facilitate generation of reprints.  System must provide accurate document counts, including number of packages prepared, number of cards affixed, and number of rejects.  
The System will also be used to automate other large volume mailings, estimated at 25,000 pieces per month, currently performed by Public Debt manually or with limited automation.  The System shall print letters and forms in batched jobs, with or without merged text.  Batches may consist of single-page letters, multiple-page letters, or a combination.  System must function with or without the card component, and support standalone printing, collating, folding, inserting, and sealing as well as folding, inserting, and sealing without printing.  In-line envelope metering is desirable, but not required, and should allow for standalone operation if offered.
System shall accommodate a variety of cut sheet paper sizes and weights, but will most commonly be used with 8-1/2 by 11 inch 20 lb. paper stock.  Card carriers, letters, and forms may be printed in color or black and white, and may include both text and graphics.  Print resolution shall not be less than 600 dpi.  
The system shall accommodate a variety of standard envelopes.  Window envelopes used to mail plastic cards are 9-1/2 by 4-1/8 inches and are constructed of white wove 24 lb. paper with diagonal seams and diagonal fully gummed flaps.  Window has durable transparent panel glued to the inside on all four sides, but System must also support open window envelopes.   

Where in-line metering is offered, postage meter must weigh envelopes up to 16 ounces, calculate postage, and meter in single pass.  Automatic dating is required, and meter must process envelopes up to 3/4 inch thick.   

Public Debt's current IT environment includes an IBM 2064-102 mainframe CPU with a z/OS operating System running CICS, DB2, and MQSeries; Lotus Notes messaging infrastructure; Windows 2000 based servers; WEBSPHERE and DB2 for JAVA applications; a J2EE-compliant application development framework that provides personalization capabilities; and Fax, Wireless, and Telephony/computer telephony integration.  Office standard word processing software is Microsoft Word, current version.  The System will be connected to Public Debt's network; files used to generate mailings will reside on file servers.  System printer must be configurable to function as a remote mainframe printer.  

The System shall be installed in ground floor office space in Parkersburg, West Virginia, without removable flooring.  220-volt electrical service is available; equipment must be pluggable, not hardwired.  The area is not subject to temperature extremes, but humidity levels fluctuate from 15 to 75% with an average of 45%.  Any HVAC requirements must be provided by contractor at time of bid.  When System is in operation, noise levels must not exceed 85 decibels, and lower levels are desirable.  System must be installed, tested, and user training accomplished no later than November 15, 2006.  Maintenance support must be available Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST.  In most instances, onsite response within 24 hours is necessary, but two-hour onsite response may occasionally be required.  

Contractor shall provide onsite user training for six (6) to twelve (12) Public Debt employees in the operation of all hardware and software.  Upon completion of the training, participants will have a working knowledge of the capabilities of the System.  

To that end, we would like information (no more than two (2) pages, not including attachments, diagrams, etc.) about products that will allow us to fulfill the above requirements.  In addition, please include your business size, along with any agency business contact information for where this system is currently being used for similar type of work.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  BPD will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, BPD may subsequently issue a Synopsis/Solicitation to acquire the appropriate system.  Information sent in response to this request shall be emailed to treasprocurement@bpd.treas.gov no later than August 31, 2006.  Please note that no Synopsis/Solicitation document is available at this time.

<DESC>The Architect of the Capitol (AoC) is planning to purchase air filters for the next five years. It is anticipated that the AoC will purchase approximately 2000 filters a quarter that will require installation and storage. All interested filter suppliers shall submit to the AoC test results as required by ASHRAE 52.2 test procedure for initial qualification within 30 days after the date of this announcement. The AoC will review the information and inform the filter suppliers within 10 working days if they are qualified to proceed to step 2. Once qualified, filter suppliers shall submit 5-filters to the LAB listed below for testing no later than 60 days after the date of this announcement. These filters must be shipped to the LAB at no cost to the Government.  In order to be considered, filters must pass the testing requirements. A copy of the report shall be submitted to AoC as evidence that they were tested by the LAB, and have passed the testing requirements for consideration. See testing procedure below, as well as the address of the LAB and the cost estimate for testing.

Testing Procedure for Evaluating Proposed 95% (MERV 15) ASHRAE Filters

Step 1 - Performed by potential supplier:
Initial Qualification of Proposed 95% ASHRAE Filter. The proposed 95% ASHRAE filter efficiency shall be equal to or have greater initial efficiency as compared to the "Flanders Rigid Air Synthetic Media Rigid Box Filter (23 3/8 inch wide x 23 3/8 inch high x 11 3/8 inch deep) as tested to the ASHRAE 52.2 test procedure.  The proposed 95% filter shall be tested in the individual 12 particle size ranges as required by the ASHRAE 52.2 test procedure and shall be submitted to the AoC for initial qualification. The ASHRAE 52.2 initial efficiency test will be only used to determine initial qualification to meet the filtration efficiency before proceeding to step 2, final qualification testing to be performed by the Government.  Initial pressure drop shall be equal to or less than 0.50 iwg at 2,000 SCFM for Box style. The filters shall be tested by an industry recognized testing laboratory that routinely performs the ASHRAE 52.2 filter test.
Send filter qualification to:
Carole Boucher
AOC Procurement Division
Ford House Office Building
Second and ?D? Streets S.W.
Washington, DC 20515

Step 2 - Performed by Government:
Final Qualification Initial Testing.  The proposed 95% (MERV 15) ASHRAE Filters shall be subjected to a validation test performed by the Government to determine initial filter efficiency in the size range of 0.5 to 18 ?m Aerodynamic Diameter when compared the "Flanders Rigid Air Synthetic Media Rigid Box Filter". Five filters (23 3/8 inch wide x 23 3/8 inch high x 11 3/8 inch deep) will be required to perform this test with the average efficiency of the five filters to determine filter efficiency equivalence. These filters shall be shipped to the LAB for testing (at no cost to the Government) to

<SUBJECT>A -- Enhanced Broadband Satellite Communications
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR_Headquarters_MKTSVY_3A0BE
<RESPDATE>092906
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Mark D Lopez, Contract Specialist,  619-524-7168
<DESC>1.0  DESCRIPTION 1.1         The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office - Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO C4I), Submarine Communications Integration Program Office (PMW 770), is seeking information regarding enhanced high capacity broadband satellite communications functionality using state-of-the-art Extremely High Frequency (EHF) and Super High Frequency (SHF) satellite antennas. This includes the Global Broadcast Service (GBS) and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Wideband Gapfiller System (WGS). PEO C4I (PMW 770) will use this information to help influence future product investments and to support Department of Navy (DoN) Information Technology investment policy. 1.2         THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes â€“ it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partyâ€™s expense.  Small Businesses having the capabilities to perform the tasking below are encouraged to reply to this RFI. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If an RFP is issued, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov and the SPAWAR E- Commerce Central website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 2.0         BACKGROUND PEO C4I (PMW 770) has acquired the OE-562/BRC Submarine High Data Rate (SubHDR) antenna system for use with its submarine broadband satellite communications systems. Capability and performance improvements to these antenna systems have been identified and an effort to acquire an enhanced broadband satellite communications antenna for submarine applications is underway. The objective of this RFI is to solicit information regarding antenna solutions that will utilize the existing and available SubHDR mast spaces; however, it will be expected to provide much greater bandwidth and throughput than its predecessor antenna systems.  The information sought is relevant to high throughput, reduced size, multi-functional, durable antennas capable of surviving a submerged at sea environment. These antennas would at a minimum operate in the X/ K / Ka / Q bands and support broadband satellite communications.  In addition, information is being sought for Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&A) improvements in the high power amplification components of these broadband satellite communications systems. Information regarding potential improvements in shock hardening; specifically underwater explosion (UNDEX) events, is also being sought. The antenna will connect to the Navy Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Multiband Terminal (NMT) for RF transmit and receive, antenna control (pointing, Built in Test (BIT), Operator Machine Interface (OMI)), and power. For the purposes of this RFI assume that there will be an Antenna Interface Unit (AIU) that will provide the necessary interfacing from NMT to the antenna. This AIU would be required to have a zero physical footprint impact in the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR). PEO C4I (PMW 770) antenna solution will be the Advanced High Data Rate (AdvHDR) for use with its submarine broadband satellite communications systems. Specifically, the areas of information being sought regarding proposed antennas are as follows: â€¢     Extremely efficient use of limited antenna storage space. â€¢     Antenna multi-functionality using aperture partitioning and multiple beam designs.  The communication frequency bands of interest with Radio Frequency (RF) connectivity needs are identified in Table 1. â€¢     Increased bandwidth enhancements in broadband satellite systems. â€¢     Shock hardening technologies. â€¢     Decreased mechanical complexity resulting in simpler and more cost effective antenna pointing mechanisms.  The object is the reduction in single point of mechanical failures and graceful degradation of mast mounted systems. â€¢     Communications antenna mast design and RM&A information. â€¢     Decreased radar cross section (RCS) signatures technology. â€¢     Platform compatibility and hardware integration information. â€¢     Multi-beam aperture and antenna multi-function (array partitioning) technologies. â€¢     Increased Low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) performance achieved by narrow beam patterns over existing SubHDR antenna, in accordance with NAVELEX 488-E â€¢     Increased simultaneity across the defined frequency bands â€¢     Increased figures-of-merit relative to the existing system capability including Gain-to-Noise Temperature (G/T) and Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) â€¢     Prolonged transmission duration at 100% duty cycle Table 1: Satellite Communications Frequency Bands/RF Interface Function    Band  Frequency Coverage       Polarization      Data Rate  Off Board Satellite Communications Node             UFO 4-7     UFO 8-10  UFO 11      DSCS 3 & SLEP       WGS 1-5     Advanced EHF       MILSTAR I/II SHF DSCS/WGS (X â€“ Band SATCOM) X       7.25 â€“ 7.75 GHz RCV; 7.9 â€“ 8.4 GHz TX  RHCP TX, LHCP RCV; LHCP â€œ& RHCP RCV & TX    1024 kbps  N/A   N/A   N/A       ïƒ¼     ïƒ¼     N/A       N/A GBS SATCOM (UFO) K     20.2 â€“ 21.2 GHz RCV   LHCP RCV    24 Mbps     N/A       ïƒ¼     N/A   N/A       N/A   N/A   N/A GBS SATCOM (WGS)  K     20.2- 21.2 GHz RCV      LHCP RCV    48 Mbps (RCV only)   N/A   N/A       N/A   N/A   ïƒ¼       N/A   N/A EHF SATCOM (LDR)  K/Q       20.2 -21.2 GHz RCV; 43.5 â€“ 45.5 GHz TX RHCP (TX & RCV)       75 â€“ 2400 bps     ïƒ¼       ïƒ¼     ïƒ¼     N/A       N/A   ïƒ¼     ïƒ¼ EHF SATCOM (MDR)  K/Q       20.2 -21.2 GHz RCV; 43.5 â€“ 45.5 GHz TX RHCP (TX & RCV)       4.8-1544 kbps     N/A       N/A   N/A   N/A       N/A   ïƒ¼     ïƒ¼ K/Ka-BAND SATCOM (WGS)  K/Ka       20.2 â€“ 21.2 GHz RCV; 30.0 â€“ 31.0 GHz TX      LHCP & RHCP (RCV & TX)  1.024 Mbps  N/A       N/A   N/A   N/A       ïƒ¼     N/A   N/A EHF SATCOM (XDR)  K/Q       20.2 -21.2 GHz RCV; 43.5 â€“ 45.5 GHz TX      RHCP (TX & RCV)       2.048 Mbps  N/A       N/A   N/A   N/A       N/A   ïƒ¼     N/A 3.0   REQUESTED INFORMATION Provide detailed information on how the proposed product would meet the above desired requirements specified in Section 2.0 of this RFI.

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2). The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government's requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time. The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure. Sellers must submit all requests for Clarification and questions by Friday, September 1 at 12:00 PM EST.

HP Printer / Plotter equipment provides compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s output equipment and standardizes the level of consumables that the government must have on hand to support. With the simplified HP Name brand consumables such as ink and toner cartridges are interchangeable. DS has well over $100,000.00 in device interchangeable consumable materials supporting the HP product line. It would not be cost effective to the government to stock consumables for devices that are unique and of limited use.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial items identified below prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is 3K45-NW-007 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-25 b.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland intends to procure the following:  Toxoplasma gondii ELISA Kit:  The microwell enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) DETECTION KIT (Toxoplasma gondii ELISA Kit) is an invitro diagnostic (IVD) immunoassay for the detection of antibody to toxoplasma gondii surface antigens in pig serum using peroxidase as the indicator enzyme.  The assay may be read visually or with an ELISA reader.  The toxoplasma gondii ELISA kit is intended to be used with swine serum that is fresh or frozen, or with tissue fluids collected from muscle.  The ELISA is an invitro immunoassay for the qualitative determination of anti-toxoplasma gondii antibody in serum.  Whole T. gondii tachyzoites are collected from invitro cell culture formalin fixed, bound to 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates, and exposed to primary swine serum.  During the firest incubation, the antibodies in the serum sample bind to the fixed tachyzoites in the test well.  The next incubation then allows the anti-swine IgG peroxidase complex to bind to the antigen-antibody complex.  The ELISA uses a goat anti-swine horse radish peroxidase conjugated IgG antibody as the second step antibody.  After a few washings to remove unbound enzyme, a chromogen (tetramethylbenzidine; TMB) is added that develops a blue color in the presence of the enzyme complex and peroxide to visualize the reaction.  The resulting blue color development indicates the p[resence of anti-Toxoplasma  antibody in swine serum.  A stop solution ends the reaction and turns the blue color to yellow, which is detected using 450-650nm filters in an ELISA plate reader.  The entire assay is completed in 30 minutes.  All necessary components (pre-coated ELISA plates, serum diluent, plate washing buffer, substrate solutions, 2nd step antibody and stop buffer) are included with the kit.  Sensitivity is 88.6% and specificity is 98.0%.
Trichinella Spiralis ELISA Test Kit:  The microwell enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) detection kit (Trichinella spiralis ELISA Kit) is an invitro diagnostic (IVD) immunoassay for the detection of antibody to Trichinella Spiralis Excretory/secretory antigens in pig serum using peroxidase as the indicator enzyme.  The assay may be read visually or with an ELISA reader.  The trichinella spiralis ELISA Kit is intended to be used with swine serum that is fresh or frozen or with tissue fluids collected from muscle.  The ELISA is an invitro immunoassay for the qualitative determination of anti-Trichinella spiralis antibody in serum.  Excretory secretory antigens collected from the invitro culture of T. spiralis muscle larvae are bound to 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates and exposed to primary swine serum.  During the first incubation, the antibodies in the sample binds to the ES antigens in the test well.  The next incubation then allows the anti-swine IgG peroxidase complex to bind to the antigen-antibody complex.  The ELISA uses a goat anti-swine horse radish peroxidase conjugated IGg ANTIBODY AS THE SECTOND STEOP ANTIBODY.  After a few washings to remove unbound enzyme, a chromogen (tetramethylbenzidine: TMB) is added that develops a blue color in the presence of the enzyme complex and peroxide to visualize the reaction.  The resulting blue color development indicates the presence of anti-Trichinella antibody in swine serum.  A stop solution ends the reaction and turns the blue color to yellow, which is detected using 450-650nm filters in and ELISA plate reader.  The entire assay is completed in 30 minutes.  All necessary components (pre-coated ELISA plates, serum diluent, plate washing buffer, substrate solutions, 2nd step antibody and stop buffer) are included with the kit.  Sensitivity is >93% and specificity is >90%.  This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions and addendums:  52.202-1 Definitions, 52.204-3 Taxpayer Identification, 52.204-6 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, 52.211-5, Material Requirements, 52.212.1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commerical Items 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  In Paragraph (B) of 52.212-5 the following apply:  52.203-6, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-34, 52.222-35, 52.222-37, 52.225-3, 52.225-13, 52.232-34 and 52.222-70.  All offerors must include copies of 52.212-3 (Representations and Certifications).  Faxed quotations are acceptable to the attention of Nancy Woodhouse at fax number 301-504-8696 on or before September 15, 2006.  All responses will be evaluated in order to determine the ability to meet the above stated capabilities.

Scope:
This acquisition is for the Defense Automatic Addressing System Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio for
LMARS/CWT, PRC, DMRS and BMOSS support to receive, edit and route logistics transactions for the Military Services and Federal Agencies for the period 29 September 2006 to 28 September 2007. STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

DEFENSE AUTOMATIC ADDRESSING SYSTEM CENTER (DAASC)

Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT), 
Process Review Committee (PRC), and DAASC Master Routing System (DMRS) and Billing and Materiel Obligation Support System (BMOSS) Support.  

ARN:  DAASJ6D061800100

1.0     BACKGROUND

DAASC designs, develops, operates and maintains a centralized value-added suite of online Automated Information Systems (AISs) designed for the processing and storage of logistics data.   These AISs are managed through four separate profiles composed of DAASC Baseline Services (DBASE), Department of Defense (DoD) Gateway Services (DGATE), DoD Data Services (DData) and Electronic Business Services (EBUS).  DAASC is in the process of maintaining  and enhancing existing DDATA application processes to the maximum extent possible, to empower the users of DAASC services, and assist in the minimization of DAASC resources to support these services.  This statement of work is to continue in those DDATA efforts.   


The Defense Automatic Addressing System Center (DAASC) designs, develops, and implements logistics solutions that improve customers' requisition processing and logistics management processes worldwide. The mission of the DAASC is to receive, edit, and route logistics transactions for the Military Services and Federal Agencies; and to provide value added services for the various types of logistics transactions processed.

As part of the Value Added Services that DAASC performs, DAASC maintains a database (Logistics On-line Tracking System (LOTS)) of Logistics transactions at all processing stages. The LOTS consists of a set of transaction handlers that extract logistics information from transaction streams that pass through the DAAS. These communication streams, in the form of DOD logistics transactions, contain information about Materiel Management actions, such as requisitions, cancellations, and confirmations for parts and supplies, shipping instruction, supply/shipment status, and international logistics communications to/from Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries.  The information kept on these transactions can be retrieved and used in a number of ways: single transactions, unit activity, NSN/part number, Project code or TCN queries, pre-stored reports, and user requested scans to perform DOD-Wide studies. 

LOTS is one of DAASC's primary centralized value-added suites of on-line AISs designed for the processing and storage of logistics data. The LOTS reads and decodes transaction messages consisting of logistics transactions and stratifies them in a relational database that contains Total Asset Visibility (TAV) about DOD and civilian agency requisitions and related data.  Logistics Response Time (LRT) reports are created from the data stored in LOTS. The LRT reports will allow DLA and the Office of the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the effectiveness of the current logistics systems and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation. The LOTS and LRT reports make up the Logistics Metric Analysis Reporting System (LMARS).  

DAASC  MASTER ROUTING SYSTEM - The DAASC Master Routing System is fundamental to the successful editing and routing of the logistics transactions processed through the DAAS.  This system uses information obtained from the DAASC Allied Communications Procedures (ACP) system, the DAASC DoD Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) file, along with the Communications Routing Indicator (COMMRI) file, Ship (SHIP) file, Plain Language Address Directory (PLAD) file, Military Routing Identifier (MILRI) file and Distribution Code information to build on-line databases.  These databases contain information used to assign COMMRIs to data pattern logistics transactions for all Service?s and Agency?s DoDAACs, and entities utilizing the DAASC services. Included, as additional information to the DoDAAD is Standard Point Location Code (SPLC), and Plain Language Address (PLA).  The Transportation Accounting Code Inquiry (TACINQ) capability provides DoD users the capability to query and verify the various transportation fund accounting codes.

BILLING AND MATERIEL OBLIGATION SUPPORT SYSTEM - BMOSS manages the Military Standard Billing/Materiel Obligation Validation (MILS/MOV) database and provides query capability and recovery/retransmission of bills and backorder validations.  BMOSS also provides the capability to maintain and distribute DoD Fund Codes used in the DoD Military Billing Processing.

Scope

The Contractor shall be responsible for performing separate tasks, in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Gateway Services (DGATE) profile, and identified in the DAASC Master Routing System (DMRS) and Billing and Materiel Obligation Support System (BMOSS) processes.  DMRS initiatives include the DAAS-Allied Communications Procedures (DAASCACP), DAAS Data Base Interrogation Query System (DAASINQ), Department of Defense Activity Address Directory (DODAAD), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) DODAAD, Trading Partner Number System (TPN), Standard Point Location Code (SPLC), Military Assistance Program Address Directory (MAPAD), MAPAD Reengineering, Master Source of Supply (MSOS) and Transportation Account Code Inquiry (TACINQ). BMOSS initiatives include Military Standard Billing System (MILSBILLS), Billing Fund Code System (FUNDCODE), Military Standard System Inquiry (MILSINQ) and Materiel Obligation Validation (MOV).  The Contractor shall be required to collaborate with the various government teams and other DAASC contractor teams to ensure this initiative is successful.  

The Logistics Management and Reporting System (LMARS) and Customer Wait Time (CWT) offer one of the most important Value Added Services that DAASC performs.  LMARS/CWT provides customers with valuable metrics on their Electronic Business.  DAASC produces specialized reports tailored to the needs of customer?s specific reporting requirements.  This tailored reporting requires analysts to be available to determine the how best to extract the reporting requirements from the available data and to build software which automates the process.

The Process Review Committee (PRC) provides a standard forum in which individual representatives from the DoD community meet and participate in DLMSO Process Review Committee (PRC) and Technical Review Committee (TRC) meetings.  Other objectives of the PRC are to allow agencies to make recommendations for development, expansion, improvement, maintenance and administration of the DLMS ANSI X.12 and to review DLMS proposed changes and prepare the responses to the proposed changes.  DAASC requires business process re-engineering support for the Process Review committee and database management.
Objectives

The first objective of this SOW is to obtain support services for the Logistics On-Line Tracking System (LOTS), Logistics Management and Reporting System (LMARS), Customer Wait Time (CWT) system and other Logistics support as necessary. In order to accomplish these following activities need to occur:

1. 	Evaluate LMARS and CWT reporting requirements to determine how data is to be selected.
2. 	Assist in installing program changes required to implement new reporting requirements.
3. 	Provide daily support for the LMARS and CWT process and LOTS.

The second objective of this SOW is to obtain support services for the Process Review Committee (PRC) and database management.

The third objective of this SOW is to obtain a resource with expert knowledge in COBOL and C programming languages and capable of supporting the DMRS and BMOSS tasks outlined in paragraph 5.0 below.

The detailed Statement of Work (SOW) is available by e-mail request to Kenneth.Bluteau.ctr@dla.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is to announce that Charleston Air Force Base (CAFB) is considering an initiative to offer access to commercial cable television (CATV)providers to install cable on CAFB at no cost to the government. Please note that due to the adjacent dual-use commercial and military airfield, site installation will require an extensive approval process.  Currently Comcast is the owner of all CATV wiring and the Government intends to contract with their company for future service.  However, if any other commercial cable providers are interested in requesting permission to install cable on base without any contractual commitment from the government to purchase any service or equipment, they should respond to the 437th Contracting Squadron, Walter Gordon, Jr. at (843)963-5162.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:	Department of the Air Force
Air Education and Training Command
325th Contracting Squadron (325 CONS)
Tyndall AFB, FL 32403-5526

2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The contractor will provide and install the intrusion detection system (IDS) at three locations on Tyndall AFB for AFNorth.  AF/XOS-F provided a list, dated 17 March 06, of approved equipment that Air Force bases are allowed to use.  Tyndall AFB utilizes the Vindicator Security Management and Reporting Terminal (SMART) Annunciator with Graphics Display listed on the attached letter.  John Beighle, Tyndall AFB Civil Engineer Security Manager, has verified that no other system is compatible with the monitoring system used by Security Forces.  The existing Vindicator SMART system at Tyndall was put in operation in the 1990s.  This requirement is to add more sub-systems to the existing system, which requires AFNorth to utilize components that are compatible and capable of integrating into the existing system.  Replacing the existing Vindicator SMART Monitoring system at the Law Enforcement Desk and 158 other sub-systems in different facilities through out the base would cost approximately $30 to $35 million.  Honeywell has proprietary rights to the system after acquiring the company Vindicators Technologies in 2005.  

3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The contract type will be firm fixed price.  The contractor will provide all labor, personnel, tools, communications equipment, materials, transportation, supervision, and other items necessary to install: a complete, operational, and certifiable access control intrusion detection system in the new AFNorth AOC building 480 to include wiring, balanced magnetic switches, magnetic locks, etc., as defined in approved drawings; install a facility V5 IDS/ACCESS vindicator control system upgrade in AFNorth building 486; add Vindicator to AFNorth/SEADS (Southeast Air Defense Sector) building to Tyndall AFB backbone system.  Adding Vindicator to the Tyndall AFB backbone system involves integrating the AFNorth buildings 480 and 486 into the existing system located in building 659 (Law Enforcement Desk).  The contractor shall provide five (5) copies of installation drawings prior to starting work, and five (5) copies of "as built" drawings after project completion.  
  
4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 ? Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This acquisition is a brand name requirement and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (c), the aforementioned description of supplies/services is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  The buildings are all interfaced into the security system of the 325th Security Forces Squadron in building 659.  The Honeywell SMART system is the only one that is compatible with the existing system.  The system is proprietary due to the interface of the monitoring equipment at the head-in, building 659, with the assets protected.

6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  The existing Vindicator SMART system is an integrated proprietary system approved for Tyndall AFB.  The intrusion/detection is integrated with the access control system as required by AFI 31-101.  Vindicator SMART System is the only security system certified by the Air Force (at area C3 Eglin AFB) for this particular configuration.  Honeywell is the manufacturer of the system and they provide the system?s parts on their GSA schedule.  Authorized distributors of the Vindicatory System exist and will be solicited via FedBizOps and GSA Ebuy.

7.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S DETERMINATION THAT ANTICIPATED COSTS WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:  Estimated pricing is based on a review of similar item pricing and past procurement history.  Additionally, FAR 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. In accordance with FAR 8.405-4, although GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, ordering activities may seek additional discounts before placing an order.  The posting of this requirement on FedBizOps provides reasonable expectation of the competed prices to be fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET SURVEY:  A market survey was conducted using internet search engines and no other manufacturer of the required materials was found.  Honeywell is the only manufacturer that produces Vindicator or Vindicator compatible equipment.  Honeywell?s GSA schedule for Vindicator Systems includes the lowest pricing and most advantageous terms for the government.  Other vendors for the Vindicator Security System exist.  At least three distributors were found, but no vendor besides Honeywell includes the Vindicator System on GSA schedule.

9.  OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  The mission of the AFNorth AOC requires security up to the NATO level.  AFNorth systems and personnel require this security protection at all times.  Without this security system, the AFNorth AOC facility will not be accredited and therefore will not be operational.

10.  INTERESTED SOURCES:  Honeywell Vindicator Security Systems, GSA Contract # GS-07F-9785H.  Open Roads Consulting Inc, Apptis Inc, and Integrated Systems Specialists were the three distributors found.
										
11.  REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:  Until it is determined that Vindicator Security Management and Reporting Terminal Annunciator with Graphics Display no longer meets 325FW and AFNorth?s IDS requirements, SMART must continue to be procured.  To ensure the above is met, 325 CE, 325 SF, and AFNorth SEADS will continue to evaluate the system capabilities of other vendors through continuing market research.  Continued efforts in this regard will ensure that the Government is getting the best value at a fair and reasonable price.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION:  The contracting officer has affixed her signature to the attached coordination and approval sheet and has thereby certified that the contents of this justification and approval is accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.

13.  TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  The appropriate management personnel of the requesting organization have certified the support data that forms the basis for this justification to be accurate and complete.

OBJECTIVE:

-We would like to remove and replace our 5 autoclave units (20" x 20" x 38") and remove and replace four steam generator pretreatment units with BRAND NAME OR EQUAL  
-Each autoclave unit should have a single door unit with hinged, fully opening, manual, radial arm door with solid silicone gasket.

BACKGROUND:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is located in the Harvey W. Wiley Federal Building, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland.   In the Wiley Building we are replacing the 5 smaller autoclave units (20" x 20" x 38"), two are located on the 4th floor, one is on the third floor, and two are in the basement prep area.  These 5 units are original equipment installed when the Wiley building was first occupied and the laboratory and media preparation areas equipped.  The primary issue has been reliability.  The number and size of the autoclaves has been adequate and appropriate for the demand.

SCOPE OF WORK:

The contractor will coordinate with the FDA Facilities Management Team, on the replacement, removal and installation of five sterilizers currently located at the FDA building, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland.  This coordination will ensure that downtime and interruption to daily research is kept to the absolute minimum.  The contractor WILL OVERSEE HAVING THE EXISTING UNITS DISCONNECTED AND REMOVED from their current locations to the loading dock.  The contractor WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE SAID UNITS.  The contractor will supply, deliver, and install the, new sterilizers to our facility at 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD.  Piping changes to accommodate the new equipment and connections are included in this installation.  The existing water softeners will be disconnected from the old units and reconnected to the new ones.  Any new steam generator pretreatment units will also be delivered and installed as part of this contract.  Also, as part of the installation, the contractor will remove the pass-through sterilizer and biological safety seal located in one laboratory, and enclose the opening on both the outside and inside wall. (It should be noted, that this sterilizer must be certified decontaminated before we can replace this unit.)  Where feasible, the contractor will use the existing stainless steel panels and doors to reduce the over-all project cost.  After the new sterilizers have been installed & tested, the contractor will coordinate with the Facilities Management Team to conduct A MINIMUM of a one hour training session PER sterilizer to ensure that all end users are properly trained in the use of the new equipment. Finally, the contractor will provide for one preventative maintenance checkout, three months after installation.  Delivery of units will occur within 90 days of award of contract. FDA will be responsible for receiving units, and will contact the contractor upon receipt of the units to schedule installation.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the AIT-3 Internal Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers.  The use of a Cybernetics Tape Drive is essential to the Government’s requirements for server compatibility thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the Cybernetics Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP).  Tape media is the primary backup media of use for the Department of State per FAM guidelines for system backup.  Department have standardized on AIT tape format for several years.  The Cybernetics AIT tape drives have been identified as the only internal tape drive that will work with servers in the field.  Use of third party equipment that is not compatible with servers will create equipment installation and configuration conflicts as well as increase the cost of providing tape backup solutions on Department’s classified and unclassified network.   To ensure compatibility with existing servers in the field the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cybernetics (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP). as a key component of the Department’s backup system.  Servers in the field have a single 1.6” hot plug tape drive bay and to ensure compatibility with existing servers, the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s backup system. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the Hewlett Packard servers as domain controller and member servers on Department of State’s unclassified and classified network.  The use of Hewlett Packard are essential to the Government’s requirements, for critical server compatibility and network security, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company at this time. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications, and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications,) Member Server have been identified as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  IRM ITCCB approved the use of Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified network.   Servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility along with integrated management functions with existing equipment.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the domain controller and member servers must be HP DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers and provided by a Hewlett Packard reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications) and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications) member servers as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  HP servers are tested for compatibility with existing hardware and software by the Department to function as domain controllers in a critical support of Department’s Active Directory structure and as member servers supporting application, file sharing, and printing functions.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.

SCOPE: The contractor shall provide all travel, plant, supervision, materials, design, and labor necessary to demolish 40 two-family housing units, located in the Bicentennial Military Family Housing area at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. 2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items. This does not mean that the work consists only of these items. But, that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor?s estimate at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer. a. Provide to the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work, any specific plans for actions not called for in this Statement of Work, specific differing procedures for actions called for already, and plans for removal of asbestos known to exist in the buildings to be demolished. Surveys for asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are attached for the contractor?s use along with the Altus AFB standards for removal as part of a demolition project. Questions concerning Lead Based Paint or Asbestos in the units should be addressed to the 97th CES Environmental Flight. b. Assure that all utilities attached to the units are shut off prior to the start of the demolition work. Utility shutoff shall be coordinated between the contractor and the 97th Civil Engineering Squadron at Altus AFB. c. Demolish 40 duplex housing units located in Bicentennial Housing at Altus AFB, OK, some of which are two-story units. Demolition shall be accomplished using mechanical contrivances such as track-hoe, front end loader, bulldozer, or other similar equipment. Other acceptable practices are manual demolition by workmen, or mechanically assisted manual demolition. Under no circumstances may explosives be used for any part of the work. d. After demolition of the structure above the concrete slab foundations, the concrete slabs shall be demolished and hauled away. e. Contractor shall demolish and haul away all driveways leading to the units, as far as the sidewalks. If sidewalk is damaged in this process, it shall be replaced by the contractor as part of the work required by this project. e. The contractor shall have the option of salvaging any usable items from the structure prior to demolition. Examples of salvageable items may be light fixtures, water closets, lavatory sinks, cabinets, doors, etc. All salvaged items will become the property of the contractor. f. Prior to the general demolition, any required hazardous material remediation shall be accomplished. Any identified asbestos, lead-based paint, etc. shall be removed and properly disposed of before the bulk of demolition can proceed. g. Before demolition of air-conditioning units, or their removal, all refrigerants shall be removed from the units and captured in approved containers which meet all local, state, and federal rules, regulations, laws, etc., regarding capture and disposal of refrigerants. Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any such refrigerants removed as part of this project. h. Debris generated by the demolition shall be removed from the worksite by the contractor and disposed of off base in an environmentally sound manner. All debris shall be cleaned up and hauled away from the site to a state-approved landfill or recycling center. i. Haul route(s) shall be as shown on the drawings. Other haul routes may be considered, but must be approved by the government before use by the contractor. If a temporary haul road is approved, it shall be built and maintained by the contractor during the performance period of the contract, and demolished by the contractor when no longer needed, and shall be built, operated, and demolished at no additional cost to the government. After the road would be demolished, the area where it is located shall be returned to its original state. j. Capping of Utilities: ? Utilities shall be capped as follows: Sewer lines shall be capped at the wyes using plugs in the wyes, or the wyes removed and capped with a pipe cap. Water lines shall be capped with repair clamps at the mains. Gas shall be capped using sweated caps on copper lines, and PVC or matching caps on plastic lines. Electrical shall be removed up to the distribution transformer and disconnected at that point, and the conductor and conduit to the house removed. ? After underground utility lines are removed, the contractor shall backfill the trenches/holes made by this removal and compact the soil removed and replaced by use of walk-behind or other mechanical vibratory compactor. It is the intent of the government to have the sites cleared of all utilities to a depth of three feet up to the point of termination of utilities to remain. ? After backfill and compaction, the entire work area shall be leveled by use of a small grader or other such contrivance, to leave the area graded to match up with surrounding elevations and shall include any fine grading required to leave the finished area acceptable for the installation of sod while providing positive drainage to existing ditches, drains, etc. If imported fill dirt is required to maintain existing grade lines, the fill shall be provided by the contractor as part of the project and shall be free of foreign-debris and suitable for topsoil usage. k. After grading, the contractor shall establish new sod over all areas disturbed by the demolition. The contractor shall install sod over the entire cleared and graded area. Sodding shall be accomplished in accordance with the guidelines established in the publication, ?Guideline Specifications to Turfgrass Sodding?, published by Turfgrass Producers International, 1855-A Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL. Of special interest to the government is that when the turf is established after all demolition is completed, the final profile of the work area shall be level without significant bumps, ridges, knolls, or other general surface irregularities. Sod shall not be left with projecting corners or edges lapped over adjoining strips of sod. Sod shall be placed level and rolled or otherwise worked to provide a relatively even surface after it is fully established and growing. For growth establishment, the contractor will be allowed use of government provided water from existing water lines and/or fire hydrants in the area to irrigate the new turf until it is fully established. The contractor shall be responsible for providing adapters, connectors, piping, hoses, and sprinklers necessary to irrigate the grass. l. The existing rented chain-link fencing around Bicentennial Housing shall remain in place for the duration of the demolition contract. The contractor may mount signs or other materials on the fence temporarily, but must remove any such items from the fence upon completion of his work. The fence gates used for access into and out of the demolition area shall be secured at the end of each workday to assure that children or other potential trespassers will not have access to the area. The demolition contractor is hereby notified that the government does not own this fence, and any damage to the fence caused by demolition activities will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or pay the owner of the fence for repair or replacement. At his own option and expense, the demolition contractor may erect additional fencing for whatever reason he may deem necessary or may ask that the temporary fencing be removed so that he may provide his own construction fence. Any fencing, gates, or accessories installed as part of this contract shall be removed upon acceptable completion of the work and all holes/disturbed areas returned to their previous conditions. m. The contractor shall refer to UFGS 01572 Construction and Demolition Waste Management as the guide for requirements concerning recycling, reuse, and disposal of demolished or dismantled materials and equipment, and reporting on disposition of these items. Adherence to the requirements of UFGS 01572 in all its sections and subsections shall be considered as part of this project. The contractor may refer any and all questions pertaining to this specification to the Environmental Flight of 97th CES. 3. SPECIAL SCHEDULING: The demolition shall be so scheduled as to assure that the area encompassing Liberty Circle will be worked first. Demolition in this area must be completed first in order to allow for planned construction by the new Military Family Housing privatization contractor. It is highly recommended that sod operations begin as soon as an area is completed to allow for new sod to become established. A site visit is scheduled on 7 August 2006 at 10:00 A.M. CST. Only one site visit will be available for this project. Contact MSgt Anthony Overbay or MSgt Carl See by 4:00 P.M. by not later than 6 August 2006 4:00 p.m. CST if you plan on attending the site visit.

<DESC>The following questions, with coresponding answers are provided:

1.	How many tablets are we packaging; the communication says 7600 packets,
but you referenced 48m.  What is the pack-out?

The tablets have been ground into a powder and sieved.  We will provide the vendor with sufficient powder to produce in excess of 7600 packets.  48M is part of the product number for the aluminized packaging material itself; GP-48M/25 or equivalent must be used; it has nothing to do with the number of packets.  I don't know what "pack-out" means, so I can't answer this one. 

2.  Is dry nitrogen flushing required?


Dry nitrogen flushing is required for both the polyethylene packet that will hold the powder as well as the aluminized packet that will hold the silica gel packets and the filled polyethylene packet.

3.  Where does the silica gel packets go?

The silica gel packets go inside the aluminized packets, along with the filled polyethylene packet.

4.  Why are different weights sited for packing; (2.5 g vs 2.6
g)?

We want each packet to contain nominally 2.5 g, therefore the packets should be filled with 2.6 g of powder, weighed with an accuracy of 0.1 g.  This way, 2.6 g plus/minus 0.1 g will ensure us that we have at least 2.5 g (and possibly as much as 2.7 g) in each packet.

5.  What is the finished good timing

Completion as stated in the requirements.



This solicitation is hereby amended as follows:  The due date for this solicitation is changed from August 31, 2006 to September 5, 2006. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<CONTACT>Adriene Y. Norman, (703) 614-6609
<DESC>Clarifications to issues submitted in reference to W74V8H-06-R-0072 Q1)  On Page 3: With the exception of the CLINS delineating the contractor manpower   reporting requirements, this solicitation is for a no-cost to the Government contract and line items are for information purposes only and are not priced. B.1 states The contract/s will be Firm Fixed Price& What does this mean if the contract is no cost to the Government? A1)  The solicitaiton is for a no-cost to the Government. However, the Contractor Manpower Reporting will be at a Firm Fixed Price. Q2)  Page 45 instructs us as follows: Price submissions shall be under separate cover. What should the price submission cover if the contract is no cost to the Government? A2)  Manpower Reporting. Q3)  Page 44: Technical Capability states This section shall not to exceed 25 pages. Later, the same paragraph states: Note: this document is not included in the page count limitation. Can you please let us know what document is referred to in the latter sentence?  A3)  The sentence prior to the paragraph you refer to states that the reference is to a detailed methodology for the transition of work&.  Q4)  Past Performance Questionnaire ,page 49,: Only Part I is included. Is there another part or more pages we are supposed to provide to our customers? A4)  No. There is only one Part.  The solicitation is 49 pages total. Q5)  In PWS Section 1.6.15 ,Page 14,: Is the contractor manpower reporting required at the time of proposal or during the contract, if awarded? A5)   See the continuation of 1.6.15 on page 15. The instructions are delineated there in the last paragraph. Q6)  The synopsis posted on the FBO site states: The proposals are to be submitted in word format not exceeding a total of 30 pages.  In the RFP, Page 44 states several page limits:    a) Under Technical Capability: This section shall not to exceed 25 pages. Does this 25 page limit apply to just the Technical Capability section?  AQ6a) Yes.   Q6b) If the the answer to a is no: Does the 25 page limit apply to the combination of Technical Capability, Management and Personnel Qualifications, and Past Performance? AQ6b)  See 1a above.    c) The end of the Technical Capability section states This document is not included in the page count limitation but will be evaluated.  Must this document fit within the total 30 pages mentioned in the synopsis? AQ6c)  No. It is stated, &This document is not included in the page count limitation.... Thus this document will be additional pages aside from the total proposal. Q7) Page 15 includes the sentence As part of this submission, the contractor will provide the estimated total cost, if any, incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.  Does this sentence mean we must provide this estimate in the proposal?  A7) Yes.  Q8)  Thought not stated as such, would the Army prefer to have interoperability between installations for the systems used on the Rapid Access program?  Reason: If accomplished, a vendor who works multiple installations would be registered for all.  A8) This is a contractors choice at the moment.  Since the selected installations are quite a distance apart, it is unlikely that a vendor registered at one installation would travel to another installation.  However, in the future if all installations ch ose to adapt, having vendors register at multiple installation may be more advantageous. As stated in the PWS the installation commander at each installation has the right to accept or reject a particular vendor. Q9)  Is there a frequency authorization person for each installation who issues permits for and assigns frequencies?   Any restrictions could influence what RFID equipment is used.   A9)  There is a Director of Information Management DOIM at each installation, and the contractor will be required to coordinate with the DOIM.  However, frequencies are not set by the Army per say , but rather the Federal Communications Agency. Q10)  Is it possible to gain approval for an additional week to submit proposals?   A10) The proposal submission date will not be extended and will remain 07 Sept 06.   -NOTHING FOLLOWS-

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the purchase of commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicita tion.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number W911S8-06-Q-0024 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotations.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect th rough Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 and DCN 20060814.

Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using  a SF 1449.  A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragr aphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to refle ct that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contract ors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current acces s information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), co mmercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  The se gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days o n which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate dela ys in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt con crete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; howeve r, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be is sued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on prop er procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the F ast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Log istics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or t he Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Stree t Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gat e Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local cl ause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identifi cation badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participat e in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A  fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by  the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and  the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is pro hibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the cont ractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAG PC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writi ng the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The F AGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contrac t.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, the ft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless p recluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of th e contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.
