<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR COPY OF A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The United States (US) Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Office of Contracts (CON) is conducting a market survey to determine the existence of sources to meet an anticipated multi-year BBG requirement for a range of FM broadcast transmission systems and related support equipment for deployment worldwide. The Government contemplates awarding one (1) or more firm-fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) with each having one (1) Base Year period with four (4) 1-year options to extend the contract term, subject to the availability of funding. The IDIQ contract(s) will have an annual minimum dollar guarantee of $25,000 for the Base Year and each exercised Option Year, with a cumulative not-to-exceed (NTE) maximum dollar amount of $10 million that includes all issued task orders. It is projected that multiple orders of FM transmission systems will be made over the duration of the contract which includes the base and option years with the majority of task orders being issued near the end or the beginning of the Government's Fiscal Year. The BBG anticipates requiring FM broadcast transmission systems, including but not limited to commercial quality, highly reliable (with redundancy), solid-state FM broadcast transmitters (stereo/mono with exciters, output power ranges from 500 Watt to 20 kilo-Watt); antenna systems sized for the transmitter power and varying gain (directional, omni-directional, narrow-band and broad-band); combiner systems (2 to 4 input ports); transmission line systems sized to the transmitter power (flexible and rigid, connectors, hangers, adapters, hardware, grounding systems, cable pullers, patch panels, dehydrator systems); audio processing/monitoring equipment; equipment racks; automatic voltage suppressors, surge suppressors and uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) sized for the transmitter systems; studio-to-transmitter link equipment; shelter and tower systems; test equipment and test sets; installation, operation and maintenance documentation; and spare parts/assemblies. BBG will provide under a separate contract all program feed downlink equipment, shipping to overseas locations, and installation services. BBG anticipates that the post contract award task order process will be handled as follows: (1) BBG will conduct a site survey and provide the Contractor with site specific information; (2) BBG will work with the Contractor to design and provide BBG a proposal for a complete FM transmission system to meet the broadcast requirement based on the fixed-prices in the contract; (3) BBG issues a task order to fabricate/supply system; (4) Contractor delivers system to BBG Washington DC Headquarters packed for international shipment; (5) BBG ships overseas and installs the FM transmission system and program feed equipment. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes, and does not constitute a request for proposal, and is not considered a commitment by the Government. In addition, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for information or inquiry. However, the Government may limit follow-on procurement actions to firms that provide responsive submissions to this notice. Interested Sources (individual firms or teams) shall identify their business size (i.e., small, large, etc.) and submit a comprehensive written "Capabilities Statement" that provides, a minimum of three (3) copies of the documentation and information as follows: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE: (A) A minimum of ten (10) years of experience in the design and manufacture of FM broadcast transmitters and FM broadcast antennas, (B) A minimum of five (5) years of experience in the design and manufacture of all solid-state FM broadcast transmitters, ( C) A minimum of one (1) year of full-time commercial service for each model (e.g. power output level, coverage) of transmitter and antenna offered, and (D) Demonstrated experience in the design and supply of complete FM broadcast systems for deployment worldwide; (2) TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: Data sheets, brochures or other documentation clearly describing all proposed commercial FM broadcast system equipment sized for medium to large urban environments addressing the full range of transmitter power and antenna combinations stated above. (BBG understands that very few firms manufacture all the equipment required for this proposed contract. The response should describe how you have worked with other firms to provide a complete broadcast system package for the customer); (3) DELIVERY: A statement of the estimated delivery time in calendar days for their FM broadcast system(s) to be delivered to a BBG designated freight-forwarder location in the vicinity of Washington DC after receipt of award of contract /delivery order (The firm should state if there are variations in delivery time due to transmitter power, and/or system complexity and/or quantity including any conditions/assumptions); and (4) SAMPLE PROJECT PROPOSAL: The firm should provide a sample FM transmission system proposal including a technical description of the equipment proposed and price breakout by equipment line item for the following: (A) 3 x 5kW FM transmitter system carrying three separate FM programs, (B) proposed transmitter site location is Baghdad, Iraq approximately 10 kilometers Northwest of Firdos Square, (C) proposed transmitter site includes 150 meter tower with transmitter building 25 meters from base of tower. To be considered in this market survey a written "Capabilities Statement" shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts (CON), Switzer Building, Room 4007, 330 "C" Street, SW, Washington, DC 20237 by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT), April 12, 2009. Submittals may be made by courier; however, telephone responses are not acceptable. If determined to be in the best interest of the Government, interested and qualified sources responding to this sources sought notice may be requested to provide follow-up information. Contractors will be notified on whether their written "Capabilities Statement," as verified by the IBB is responsive to this notice. A determination to compete, or not to compete, this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.</p>

<DESC>Subject market survey is for an effort termed "RFFA re-host."  The RFFA is a custom built electronic component within the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) receiver and consists of several different discrete components that generate the radar's radio frequencies.  It was originally designed in the 1980s and is long overdue for a re-design.  The RFFA re-host is a goal of the TDWR Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) as defined by the FAA Joint Resources Council (JRC) approved at the end of FY07, and is required by AJW-144 in order to accomplish its mission of supporting the TDWR program.
Please find complete Market Survey with instructions and Business Delcaration attached. Note that the cut-off date for responses to this survey is 02 Apr 09.

<CONTACT>Dana Brooks, 202 267 8704

<a href="mailto:dana.d.brooks@faa.gov">dana.d.brooks@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering the award of a single contract for the modernization of the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure (ASTI). The contract would require the contractor to provide, deliver, integrate, and test ASTI components to include the replacement of the Network Management and Control System (NMCS).  Additional life cycle support services such as ASTI training development and conduct, ASTI technical documentation development, and maintenance support will also be included as part of the scope of the contract.  The FAA is targeting a Final Screening Information Request (SIR) release in summer 2009 with a contract award in second quarter FY2010.
Draft SIR and Industry Questions
The FAA has posted two previous announcements in May 2008 and Sep 2008 seeking Industry input on the technical and programmatic aspects of the program.  As a part of the continued market research with the modernization of ASTI, the FAA is soliciting input on the draft SIR contained with this announcement.  The FAA is interested in feedback on the reasonableness of the requirements and whether significant re-design or development would be required to meet the technical specifications as currently defined. 
With this announcement the FAA is providing the following draft documents for Industry comment:
	Section B: Schedule of Supplies and Services	Section C: Statement of Work	Section H:  Special Contract Requirements	Section L:   Instructions, Condition, and Notices to Offerors	Section M:  Evaluation Factors for Award	Attachment J-1: ASTI Technical Specification	Attachment J-2:  Transition Constraints	Attachment J-3:  List of ASTI Facilities	Attachment J-4:  Performance Requirements Summary
In addition to the comments on the above documents, the FAA is requesting input on the topics and questions contained the attached file.  Industry should use the attached template to provide the requested feedback and any questions or comments on the contents of the Draft SIR.  The FAA requests that all files, at a minimum, be submitted in MS Word format. 
The FAA will continue to evaluate the degree of modernization required at each of the locations identified in Attachment J-3. Attachment J-3 is intended to reflect the nature and type of locations requiring modernization.  The final SIR will contain the projected list of facilities with the associated components.  However, the FAA reserves the right to modernize less than the full complement of ASTI equipment identified for upgrade in Section C.5.2.1 and Attachment J-3.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract with the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) for assessments of DOE's scientific and engineering missions and programs. The contract proposed period of performance is 5/03/09 - 5/02/14.
The tasks that the contractor is responsible to perform include: informing the Department of relevant scientific and technical data and related views of experts about its research and programmatic activities; applying the judgments of science and engineering to public policy; and otherwise contributing to the vitality and productivity of the Department's scientific enterprise and its extended research and development communities. The Academy's unique qualification is its ability to provide independent scientific and technical advice of unparalleled objectivity and of the highest quality, which possesses an inherent degree of public acceptability. Under this contract the Academy may, as requested, examine, experiment, and/or report upon any subject of science or art relevant to the Department's missions, programs and activities.The value of this effort is estimated to be $40,000,000.
The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Executive Order 12832 provides that noncompetitive procedures can be used to contract with the Academy. It states:
	when a department or agency of the executive branch of          the Government determines that the Academy, because of          its unique qualifications, is the only source that can           provide the measure of expertise, independence,          objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet          the department's or agency's program requirements,          acquisition of services by the Academy may be obtained          on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance          with applicable law and regulations.
The National Academy of Sciences performs a unique public service. It brings together leaders from academia, industry, government, and other sectors to address critical national issues and provide cogent, unbiased, and scientifically informed advice to the U.S. Government and its citizens. To a degree unmatched elsewhere, these institutions elicit the participation of virtually any scientist whom it invites to serve. The credibility of the resulting reports is maximized by the recognized impartiality of the institutions which manufacture no product, possess no funds to disburse, have no power of decision over the scientific establishment and have no executive or regulatory authority. Thus, neither it nor its transient working committees which may be given immediate responsibility for a particular study or inquiry can be fairly accused of a vested interest in the outcome of deliberations. Interested parties must submit a letter of interest and capability statement for consideration by April 10, 2009 to: Mr. Benjamin Lardizabal, MA-642.1, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20585, or via e-mail to benjamin.lardizabal@hq.doe.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541618. 
The written response must include a general technical proposal for performing the services mentioned in this announcement, past performance client information for similar work, resumes of individuals who would be potentially assigned to the work and a rational why the your firm?s solution would be in the Government?s best interest.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award one contract to upgrade two economic models used in planning for the development of Federal offshore energy resources:  the Offshore Environmental Cost Model (OECM) and the Market Simulation Model (MktSim). The anticipated period of performance will be 18 months from the effective date of the contract.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690, and the work is multi-disciplinary.
The MMS is responsible for managing Federal offshore energy resources.  The MMS uses the OECM to estimate the environmental and social costs of natural gas and oil extraction activities on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and MktSim to determine the substitution effects of energy alternatives to OCS oil and natural gas production, as well as to estimate the consumer surplus value of OCS oil and gas extraction activities.    
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Department of the Interior is required to keep in place at all times a 5-year schedule (5-year program) of proposed OCS oil and gas lease auctions specifying, as accurately as possible, the size, timing, and location of each lease sale.  As part of the 2-3 year iterative process of public comment, analysis, and decision, MMS conducts a cost-benefit (net benefits) analysis of each proposed 5-year schedule for the Secretarys consideration.  A part of this analysis is estimation of Net Environmental and Social Costs (ESC) imposed on society by the exploration, development, production, and transportation activities necessary to get to market those oil and gas resources anticipated to be discovered and produced under each proposal.  Using MMS-developed exploration & development scenarios and production profiles, MktSim estimates the volume of each other energy source (increased imports, coal, alternative energy, reduced consumption etc.) the economy would require in the absence of the new lease sales in the 5-year proposal (essentially, the No Action Alternative in the programmatic Environmental Impact Statement).  The OECM estimates the ESC anticipated from OCS oil and gas activities resulting from the 5-year proposal as well as the ESC of the energy alternatives/substitutions likely to result from not approving a new 5-year program.  Subtracting the latter from the former produces the Net Environmental and Social Costs.  MktSim also estimates the consumer surplus benefits of the activities anticipated under the 5-year proposal.  The purpose of the contract would be to completely revise both models and all associated data.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and DUNS Number via email to debra.bridge@mms.gov or via U.S. Mail to Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, MS-2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia  20170, by 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, April 8, 2009.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. M09PS00038 on all correspondence.  TELEPHONE INQUIRES ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle use and highway travel.  To accomplish this, NHTSA collects and analyzes motor vehicle crash data, and develops, promotes, and implements educational programs, vehicle safety standards, research, and enforcement programs. 

These standards require manufacturers of motor vehicle and equipment items to conform to and certify compliance with these standards. Also, these standards and regulations are written in terms of minimum safety performance requirements for motor vehicles and/or items of vehicle equipment. In addition, under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has statutory authority to provide vehicle safety performance information to consumers.

The purpose of this contract is to hire an integrated communications marketing/advertising firm seasoned in strategic and tactical development to support NHTSAs vehicle safety programs. Marketing support will be provided year-round to promote vehicle safety campaigns. The campaigns entail programs such as, but not limited to, a new and improved 5-Star rating system, new vehicle safety technologies, electronic stability control, lane departure warning systems, back-over technology, forward collision warning systems, and child restraint systems, new CAF rules, as well as the necessity to report safety defects to NHTSA through the Office of Defects and Investigations.  

Description: 

The objective of this requirement is to provide the Office of Communications and Consumer Information (OCCI) with all necessary services in support of the Vehicle Safety Communications Program.  This requirement will include a revised multi-media communications plan to drive the campaigns; provide technical assistance to NHTSA and other designated partners; identify new and emerging cost effective ways to reach the target audience; create collateral materials (posters, radio liners, and earned and paid media materials such as internet advertising (banners, Google, Yahoo); develop communication materials for new campaigns in addition to enhancing any existing campaigns such as, www.safercar.gov. The contractor will provide assistance in intuitive web design and layout for www.Safercar.gov and comply with meeting and reporting requirements as specified in the Statement of Work. Additionally, over the life of the contract, certain ad hoc requirements not specified herein, but related to the Agencys vehicle safety communications work cited in this statement of work will require the contractor to provide additional technical assistance as needed, and thus may require additional funding from NHTSA.  The NAICS Code for this contract is 541820.  An Indefinite Quantity, Time and Material type contract is planned with one base period of one with four option years.  It is the Offerors responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.  The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about April 20, 2009.    

Period of Performance:  Five (5) year contract starting on or about 8/1/2009.

RFP Number:  DTNH22-09-R-00213

Contract Award:

NHTSA intends to issue an full and open, competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) with the intention of awarding an Indefinite Quantity, Time and Material type contract with one (1) base year to include four (4) one-year option periods, resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.

<CONTACT>Brian R. Ellis, Phone (202) 366-4843, Email brian.ellis@dot.gov
<DESC><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:<br />&bull; Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;<br />&bull; Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors among diverse audiences;<br />&bull; Providing grants to state and local government to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs designed to reach diverse audiences; and<br />&bull; Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belt use and preventing impaired driving has a significant impact on meeting NHTSA's core mission and so continue to be two of the agency's priority programs. Innovative public information campaigns and highly visible law enforcement efforts have increased occupant protection use and decreased impaired driving.</p>
<p>Research has also demonstrated that despite the substantial progress we have made in reducing vehicle crashes and fatalities, motorcycle crashes are one of the main reasons NHTSA's progress in increasing highway safety has stalled.  For a decade, motorcycle fatalities and injuries have steadily increased.  In fact, they have more than doubled since 1997.  These increases have essentially offset the decreases in NHTSA's overall fatality and injury numbers that are released annually.</p>
<p>To meet its mission of decreasing fatalities and injuries on our Nations' roadways, NHTSA must continue to develop English and Spanish language messaging and materials on seat belts, impaired driving, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, and older driver safety, distracted driving, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives. In addition, the Agency needs to have the ability to develop new communication strategies and initiatives in response to traffic safety problems as they are identified in an annual review of the Agency's data.</p>
<p>NHTSA utilizes an integrated approach when developing and implementing its communications programs, and all tools available to communications experts are explored for use in any given campaign. This includes reviewing data, including traffic research and market research, advertising, media relations, collateral materials, partnerships, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Effective communication must be maintained not only with the strategic target audiences, but policy makers must also be made aware of the potential lifesaving actions they can take to alleviate these problems.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this multi-year project is to work with an integrated communications marketing/advertising firm that can use its 1) social marketing experience; 2) experience and knowledge of the Hispanic population; 3) ability to adapt existing materials into Spanish, and create new materials that will positively resonate with Spanish speaking populations; and 4) strategic and tactical development and execution experience to provide NHTSA with public relations and communications support in the development of English and Spanish language communications, marketing campaigns, and related tools that can be used by our partners, the States, and highway safety advocates throughout the United States to promote traffic safety messages; raise traffic safety awareness; and increase positive traffic safety behaviors among English and Spanish speaking populations through information dissemination and strategically designed program initiatives relating to seat belts, impaired driving, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, older driver safety, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives as they are identified in an annual review of the Agency's data.</p>
<p><strong>INTENT</strong></p>
<p>This procurement will be an 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement. This procurement is anticipated to result in a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract. The NAICS Code/Size Standard is 541820.  The period of performance is estimated at 5 years.  NHTSA intends to release the Solicitation on or about the April or May 2009.</p>
<p><strong>No email messages or phone messages will be responded to BEFORE the solicitation is posted.</strong></p>

<DESC>Notethis synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on January 22, 2009 under Sources Sought Notice No. SS-ETSB-091001-48.

The National Cancer Institutes (NCI), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), located in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking a contractor to systematically test novel agents against childhood cancer preclinical models (both in-vivo and in-vitro, as well as specialized studies), with the overall objective being to assist CTEP in fulfilling its mission of identifying more effective treatments for children with cancer.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks:

TASK AREA 1  IN VIVO TESTING
--In vivo testing panel:  The Contractor shall provide for testing and maintain a panel of preclinical models for approximately 10 childhood cancers, with each cancer type represented by 4-10 different xenograft lines deemed suitable for in vivo drug testing (henceforth termed the pediatric preclinical in vivo panel).
--Stage 1 testing:  The Contractor shall participate in the design of studies to test agents and  shall conduct experiments to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ten to twelve agents (or combinations of agents) annually in the first stage of testing.  Stage 1 testing of an agent shall involve evaluating the test agents activity at its maximum tolerable does (or the dose recommended by the pharmaceutical collaborator) against the entire pediatric preclinical in vivo panel.
--Stage 2 testing:  For agents for which antitumor activity is observed in Stage 1 testing, Stage 2 testing shall include a further evaluation of the antitumor activity of the agent against the selected tumor types for which activity was observed in Stage 1. Approximately 6 agents per year are anticipated to proceed to stage 2 testing because of activity observed in Stage 1 testing, and for each active agent there will be one to three tumor types for which further testing is warranted.  Stage 2 testing will vary depending upon the agent and the responsive tumor types, but may include: developing a full dose-response curve for the agent against the tumor types for which activity was identified in Stage 1 testing; studying the activity of the agent in combination with either standard anticancer agents or with experimental agents; studying the pharmacokinetics of the agent to correlate antitumor activity with the agents blood levels; studying the agent in orthotopic mouse models and in models of metastatic disease; studying the agent in relevant genetically engineered mouse models; evaluating alternative schedules and/or routes of test agent administration; and, performing evaluations of pharmacodynamic markers of drug effect.

TASK AREA 2  IN VITRO TESTING
--In vitro testing:  The Contractor shall provide for testing and maintain a panel of in vitro models for selected childhood cancers to be used for in vitro testing of agents supplied to the Contractor. The pediatric preclinical in vitro panel may focus on a subset of the overall tumor types included in the in vivo testing panel (15 to 25 cell lines in toto) and should include a diversity of biological characteristics.
--The Contractor shall utilize a standard protocol for in vitro testing for agents.
--For agents (or combinations of agents), the Contractor shall participate in the design of studies and/or submission of protocols for testing of the agent against the in vitro cell line panel.  

TASK AREA 3  SPECIALIZED STUDIES
--Pharmacokinetic evaluations: For agents progressing to Stage 2 testing for which there are not sufficient extant data describing the pharmacology of the agent in murine models (estimated to be approximately 4 agents annually), the Contractor shall participate in the design of studies to determine systemic exposure and plasma elimination kinetics in appropriate animals and using the formulations and routes of administration used for drug testing.
--Pharmacodynamic evaluations:  For selected tested agents, the Contractor shall participate in the design of studies to establish whether agents have achieved target inhibition/modulation within tumor or leukemia cells under test conditions or have elicited a predicted pharmacodynamic effect related to the agents mechanism of action.
--Molecular characterization and correlation of molecular characteristics with antitumor activity of tested agents:  The Contractor will perform exploratory (hypothesis-generating) bioinformatics analyses to correlate the preclinical activity of tested agents against xenografts and cell lines to the baseline molecular characteristics of the preclinical models as defined by their gene expression profiles and chromosomal segment copy number changes.  

The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is November 1, 2009  October 31, 2014, with a 1-year base period and 4, 1-year option periods. 

It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about April 10, 2009 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Full electronic copies will not be accepted, but portions of the proposal may be provided on disc. The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP N01-CM-91001-03. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to TSE International, 5301, Shreveport-Blanchard Highway, Shreveport, LA 71107 for the acquisition of one (1) power reel stand (model PRS 18 132 x 115) to support the handling of minesweeping cables during field repairs.  The reel stand must deliver 90,000 In-Lbs of torque while handling an 18,000-pound reel measuring 132 inches in diameter and 115 inches in width.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  TSE International Inc's Powered Reel Stand is the only system qualified to meet the Navy's requirement to handle minesweeping cables during field repairs.  TSE Powered Reel Stand is the result of several difficult redesigns of previous models to support the handling of minesweeping cables.  The reel stand is designed for quick change of the reel without tools.   The reel stand is the only stand that employs a post-type level-wind, caliper ! brake, and can pay out or pay in the cable.  The reel stand operates on diesel fuel and is designed to withstand the weather of the Texas coastline.  The current reel stand, in use by the Navy, required extensive testing, redesign, and modifications to meet the navy's unique field repair requirement.  An alternate manufacturer will have to duplicate TSE's design and development effort, which would make the alternative reel stand cost prohibitive in the quantities the Navy requires.

This purchase is not considered suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The air fla! sks will be used with existing hardware which has already been through operational and technical evaluation.  Once a system is certified nothing can be altered without approval from the project engineer.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly to the government and to the mission.  Any variance in the parts used on certified systems would jeopardize the certification of the systems and ultimately the mission. The test process certified two vendors (Luxfer USA Limited and Structural Composites Industries) as documented on NAVSEA drawing 6893418 that are qualified to meet the requirement. Luxfer has discontinued manufacturing the certified item, thus leaving Structural Composites Industries LLC as the only certified manufacturer of the item. Any vendor desiring to qualify a product to meet the requirements and application of NAVSEA drawing 6893418 may contact Shawn Smith (shawn.o.smith@navy.mil or 850-235-5635) NSWC PCD Code E11 to initiate the process.   Delivery will ! be required not later than 15 June 2009 to the Naval Support Activity (NSA) Panama City, Receiving Office, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407.  NAICS is 333995.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific) in supportof Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Officer forLittoral and Mine Warfare, NAVSEA, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), andDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovativeresearch and development (R&D) proposals to explore command, control,communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance(C4ISR) maritime domain awareness (MDA) systems. The challengespresented by undersea threats provide the impetus for the development ofdeployable and off-board acoustic surveillance systems which are networked,distributed, and multi-static capable, such as Fixed Distributed System (FDS),and Deployable Autonomous Distributed Systems (DADS). The very low noiselevels associated with modern submarines are a significant challenge forpassive systems and a natural augmentation of such systems is the addition ofan acoustic source. In addition to working with deployed systems, activesignalsfrom such sources could also be received and processed by surface ships withtowed arrays. In this context an active system has the potential forsignificantimprovement in coverage against a quiet target over a purely passive system.An additional benefit for acoustic sources deployed from small craft, unmannedsurface vehicles (USVs) or buoys is the elimination of vulnerabilitiesassociatedwith operating an acoustic source from a large vessel (beaconing). Operationsinvolving a group of  small craft pose several challenges including: (1)dynamics of a small craft from the standpoints of deployment and recovery ofa low frequency active array; (2) shock and vibration effects associated withhigh speed transit of small craft; (3) energy storage and management; (4)high efficiency, high power density amplifiers and transducers; (5) power plantsizing to maximize mission performance; (6) networking and processing toexploit information provided by distributed sensors and information systems;(7) active acoustic marine mammal mitigation; and (8) interference affectingthose networked C4ISR systems.
SSC Pacific, in support of NAVSEA, ONR, and DARPA, is particularly interestedinsoliciting innovative R&D proposals of multiple mechanical/ocean engineeringconcepts for automated deployment, recovery and operation of maritimesurveillance systems deployed from small craft (e.g., 11 m), suspended frombuoys, located on the littoral ocean bottom, and deployed from non-dedicatedsurface ships. Of additional interest are concepts supporting the networking ofsuch platform systems to provide robust anti-submarine warfare (ASW); C4ISR;port/harbor surveillance; and global domain awareness. While various militaryships can be considered, Surveillance Towed Array (SURTASS) Ships or theLittoral Combat Ship (LCS) or small craft are of most interest to the Navy. Theareas of interest include: (1) compact, low frequency acoustic source arrays;(2)deployment and retrieval mechanisms; (3) innovative packaging; (4) compact,lightweight power electronics (amplifiers, energy storage); (5) power systemsfor the lightweight towed arrays; (6) various material storage and handlingsystems; (7) associated control systems, and software/networking concepts tosupport distributed C4ISR global domain awareness; (8) cyber interferencetargeting those C4ISR systems; (9) active acoustic marine mammal mitigationand (10) adaptations of small craft design which may better support sensorsystems.
This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplatedby FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. Awards will be in the form of FAR procurementcontracts.  Awards will only be made for basic research, applied research, ordevelopment that is not related to the development of a specific system.Awards will not be made for commercial or non-developmental items.

<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the  Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems intends to issue a  solicitation for the manufacture and delivery of the M762A1 Electronic Time  (ET) Fuze and M762A1 ET Safe & Arm (S&A) Assemblies.  The M762A1 Fuze is an  electronic fuze used with spin stabilized 105mm and 155mm artillery cargo  carrying projectiles.  The M762A1 ET Fuze in the time mode can be set manually  without the need of a tool or set inductively via an inductive link with the  M1155 Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (PIAFS). These setting features  support an increase in the rate of fire and reduce the potential for fuze  setting mistakes due to human errors. In the time mode the fuze is settable  from 0.5 seconds to 199.9 seconds in 0.1 second increments.  The Government  expects to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract for an approximate base  quantity in the range of 20K-25K.  The contract will include four option years  with ranges for the following approximate quantities:  FY09 (25K-31K); FY10  (25K-32K); FY11 (30K-50K); FY12 (30K-44K). The contract will also include  options with ranges for supplemental Army, and Marine Corps requirements:   FY08 (10K-20K); FY09 (10K-25K); FY10 (10K-25K); FY11 (20K-40K); FY12 (20K- 40K). The Government reserves the right to exercise options up to the maximum  aggregate quantities available in the base period and the four option periods  without regard to the actual FY. The M762A1 ET Fuze and M762A1 ET Fuze S&A  Assemblies will be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged and delivered  in accordance with a Government Technical Data Packages (TDP) and applicable  contract requirements.  This procurement will be restricted to the National  Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB).  Numbered notes 13 and 26 are  applicable to this effort.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) exists for this  effort and may be obtained provided a Non-Disclosure Form is signed and on  file.  The Non-Disclosure Agreement may be obtained via e-mail by sending a  request electronically to Peter Vincenti, Contract Specialist, at  peter.vincenti@us.army.mil or by calling 973-724-5368.   Interested offerors  may also obtain a copy of the uncertified TDP upon request.  A DD2345 must  also be submitted prior to receiving the TDP package (CD).  It is expected  that the solicitation will be posted on the JM&L LCMC Procurement Network in  approximately 50 days.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Any formal solicitations will be announced separately. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI and responses to this RFI will not be returned.<br /><br />1. PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION: The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group at Brooks City-Base, TX is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing a fire resistant, light weight, durable and breathable fabric for potential use in making flight suits.</p>
<p>The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 315299 (SIC: 2389) is 500 employees. All business sizes, to include small business and the sub-categories of small businesses, are being looked at during our market research phase.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The FIRESAFE program is an integrated product team (IPT) within the 77th Aeronautical Systems Group with responsibility for the design development test programs and sustainment of fire resistant equipment.</p>
<p>The IPT is looking for a fabric that will give our pilots increased performance in fire protection. We are interested in a flight suit fabric with a weight of less than 6.5 oz/yd2 that can withstand ASTM F-1930-00 (instrumented manikin, four second exposure, 2 cal/cm2/sec) with less than 35.0% burn injury prediction when configured as the CWU-27/P flight suit or a comparable configuration.</p>
<p>In addition to increased burn protection, reducing the thermal burden is also important. The burden needs to be equal to or less than the current flight suit. Since thermal burden varies depending on weight, moisture wicking, air permeability, weave, individual user, and other factors, a fabric sample is required for assessing this characteristic.</p>
<p>Following thermal burden in importance to this request are durability and cost.</p>
<p>3. INFORMATION REQUESTED: Interested parties must provide the following information on:</p>
<p>a. Fabric fire resistance<br />b. Abrasion, pilling and air permeability testing information (if available) <br />c. Fabric weight per square yard<br />d. Fabric cost per square yard</p>
<p>All test methods used and test results must be provided.</p>
<p>Additionally, 5 samples of material (6 in x 6 in) must be provided.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical information requested, we require interested parties answer the following questions:</p>
<p>a. What is your business size? If you are a Small business, do you qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p>b. If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?</p>
<p>c. In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Indian Incentive, etc.)? What is the extent of your participation in these programs?</p>
<p>d. Is it your intent to participate in this acquisition with other firms as teaming members or joint ventures? What other teaming opportunities do you see for this acquisition?</p>
<p>e. If you are a large business, do you foresee any small business subcontracting opportunities in this acquisition? If so, how are small business firms resourced?</p>
<p>f. If you are a large business, feedback is required on small business goals; please provide your thoughts on whether the following subcontracting goals, calculated on the basis of total subcontracting dollars, would be realistic:</p>
<p>Small Business 28% (Total awarded or obligated dollars)<br />Small Disadvantage Business 5%<br />Woman Owned Small Business 5%<br />HUBZone Small Business 3%<br />Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 3%<br />Veteran Owned Small Business 3%</p>
<p>g. For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 315299? If not, why? Please provide your recommendations concerning the proposed NAICS.</p>
<p>4. RFI Response: Mailed RFI responses and material samples should be directed to: 648 AESS / TAA, Attn: Captain Lee, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base, TX 78235-5119. Electronic responses (.doc format) or technical questions can be emailed to arthur.beasley@wpafb.af.mil and jiajia.lee@brooks.af.mil.

<DESC>Sources Sought - Request for Information for Market Research Only<BR><BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Center McPherson, Fort McPherson, Georgia is conducting market research to determine the extent to which large and small businesses are capable of performing as the prime contractor for a renewal requirement.  The requirement is to provide enterprise-wide Copier/MFD products and services support for all Army installations within the United States to include Alaska and Hawaii.  There are approximately 50 Army installations located throughout the U.S.  In addition, support will also include the smaller Army elements that are remotely located.  This is a Sources Sought announcement only for purposes of conducting market research.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Government will not reimburse any concern for any information that is submitted in response to this Sources Sought request.  Any information submitted is voluntary.  The Army is considering a multiple-award, indefinite delivery- indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  The type of contract will be determined after evaluation of market research.  The primary anticipated North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 333315 (Photographic and Photocopying Equipment Manufacturing).  Interested businesses are invited to review the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) in order to provide capabilities demonstrating ability to successfully perform this requirement.  The PWS details the objectives, requirements and specifications.  Please use the Market Survey questions to record your capabilities.  This format will be used as a uniform format for consistency in evaluating responses.  Both documents are located at website:  http://www.forscom.army.mil/aacc/Enterprise_Solutions/ENTERPRISE_SOLUTIONS.htm.<BR>The survey will indicate the following primary capabilities: 1) the capability to perform all requirements specified in the PWS.  2) Past Performance information demonstrating relevant past experience within the last three years providing this type of service. 3) Demonstrate knowledge of risk management and how to analyze and implement strategies to mitigate those risk factors.  4) Business status/size (large, small, small disadvantaged, 8a, woman owned, service disabled veteran, Hub Zone or any other socio-economic group for NAICS 333315) and whether interested as prime or sub-prime.  All interested businesses are required to respond to this sources sought announcement via email by April 10, 2009, 3:00 p.m. EST.  Responses must include company point of contact information.  The information provided in response to this sources sought will be used to finalize the acquisition strategy for this requirement.  Large business concerns are not prohibited from responding to this announcement.  However, information submitted from large businesses may not be used if an adequate number of small businesses demonstrate an ability to perform.  All interested businesses must provide capability statement for evaluation to Mr. Michael J. Eadon via email at michael.j.eadon@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Notes:  1) Industry may submit input/suggestions for improvement and/or clarification to the PWS while in draft form.  2) Due to the limited capacity of email inbox, please keep email file as small as possible.  Recommend that responses have minimal graphics and colors in order to reduce file size.  3) The processing of this award will transfer from Center-Fort McPherson to Fort Sam Houston (FSH) under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  This transfer is expected to occur after the market research phase or when the gaining team becomes operational at FSH.  The Contracting Officer will be Mrs. Melisa Barbee. <BR>

A description of the work to be performed follows:  
The Riparian Habitat Establishment Model (RHEM) is a variably saturated flow and plant growth model built upon the widely used HYDRUS 2-D code (Simunek, et al, 1999).  The model incorporates the rigorous computation of moisture movement in the root zone provided by HYDRUS 2-D with specific plant growth routines for modeling cottonwood seedling growth.  These routines allow for an accurate simulation of the following effects on seedling survival: soil water availability; plant responses to soil moisture stress; rates of leaf and root growth; and atmospheric conditions.  The model was developed to work in concert with a suite of models Reclamation is developing to study the implications of reservoir management changes on the Sacramento River on the regeneration of riparian forests.  This scope of work details tasks that are required to further enhance the capabilities and accuracy of RHEM for simulating cottonwood seedling growth processes that were documented during field experiments conducted at UC Davis. Tasks include RHEM Modifications, Calibration and Validation.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issues this Request for Information to identify potential sources who are interested in and capable of providing the information technology services described herein.  

Business Need

Today, the OCC uses a number of disconnected systemsMicrosoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes databasesto manage personnel security processes. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including:

Lack of a Central Data Repository The OCC does not currently have a central system of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information.

Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for OCC staff.

Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, OCC personnel are less focused on the core business of security.

The OCC seeks interested contractors who are capable of designing and implementing a new system to replace its collection of existing systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management.
System Requirements

The scope for the first release of this new system includes the features necessary to support the following personnel security business processes and sub-processes. 

-   Obtain employee or contractor information
     -   Determine employee on-boarding requirements
     -   Determine contractor on-boarding requirements
     -   Approve on-boarding packet

-   On-board personnel
    -   Establish candidate suitability
    -   Conduct background investigation
    -   Issue credential
    -   Issue national security clearance

-   Maintain personnel
    -   Conduct reinvestigation
    -   Replace credential
    -   Update personnel information
    -   Generate reports
    -   Grant national security clearance
    -   Renew SmartID
    -   Replace SmartID

-   Off-board personnel
    -   Complete CIPS off-boarding tasks

Features to support physical security and emergency security are outside the scope of the first release of this new system.
The system requirements OCC has identified for this solution are documented in the attached files.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice - CDC Lab Renovation Design

The Indian Health Service, through a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), is seeking qualification statements of AE firms to provide design services for a renovation of an existing laboratory facility in Anchorage, AK, supporting the CDC Arctic Investigations Program (AIP).  

The existing two story brick building was constructed in the 1990s and is located at 4055 Tudor Centre Drive, Anchorage, Alaska.  The facility consists primarily of labs, lab support offices, an entry lobby, and shipping/receiving spaces on the first floor with general offices and support spaces on the second floor.  Mechanical systems are housed primarily in a rooftop penthouse above the second floor.  

This project includes a first floor renovation (approximately 4800 sqft) of the existing biosafety containment labs, expanding those labs into existing office spaces, and relocating those offices into a new first floor addition (1300 sqft) adjacent to the labs, along with associated mechanical system changes and new lab casework throughout.  Access during construction must be maintained for selected areas on the first floor.  Offices on the entire second floor and the parking lot will remain occupied during construction.  

The estimated performance period of this design project is from June 24, 2009 to November 27, 2009, with an option for construction administration services through July, 2010.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high-rate, tensile test machine to support the operations and research of the Metallurgy Division. The machine will be used to characterize the tensile stress-strain behavior of metals such as automotive sheet steel, aluminum, and magnesium at strain rates, de/dt,  in the range 0.1 1/s < de/dt < 400 1/s. 

After NIST obtains and analyzes the results of this market research and develops specifications for a high-rate tensile test machine that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If NIST identifies at least two qualified small businesses during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to use Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirements.

Requirements
NIST has a need for a high-rate tensile test machine that can meet the following five requirements:
1. able to impose a uniform, constant, tensile strain rate of at least 400 1/s on a test specimen with a uniform cross-section length, dimension A of ASTM E8, at least A=25 mm, a width, w=6 mm, and a thickness, t=3 mm. This requirement implies that the machine can attain an actuator velocity of at least 14 m/s. 
2. able to sustain and measure a specimen load of at least 25 kN at the highest strain rate attainable,
3. capable of acquiring at least 100 load-displacement points during a test lasting 0.6 ms, and having at least two and preferably six additional channels for acquiring temperature or strain-gauge signals,
4. include an integrated signal-conditioning system for exciting and reading at least two strain-gauges mounted to the specimen, and 
5. include a three-dimensional digital image correlation system capable of measuring the local strain in the gauge section at a rate concomitant with the rest of the data acquisition system. Such a strain-measurement system should include, in addition to the camera system, suitable software to analyze the resulting images to determine the specimen strain. 

NIST seeks responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334519, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or fewer.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a ferromagnetic resonance force microscope facility for microwave magnetic measurements of magnetic nanostructures.  Our plan is to use this acquisition as a starting point for a series of projects involving ferromagnetic resonance force microscopy.  As such, the need is for a magnetic force microscope with a modular design that can be modified to accommodate microwave excitation of the sample, taken apart, reconfigured, and used as a flexible test bed for a variety of measurement schemes.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a magnetic force microscope that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
NIST has a need for a magnetic force microscope that would meet the following requirements:
1.	The microscope probe head must be simultaneously compatible with operation in high vacuum, in vertical and horizontal magnetic fields up to 5 Tesla and at temperatures from 300 K to 4.2 Kelvin.
2.	The sample stage area must be greater than 2 cm diameter to accommodate microwave coaxial cable connections to the sample.
3.	The sample stage must be supported by a nanopositioner or combination of nanopositioners to allow 4 mm translation of the sample stage in all three directions.
4.	The nanopositioners shall be fitted with encoders for closed loop operation. 
5.	The sample stage will include x-y scanning over 20 micrometers square with 10 micrometers in the z-direction.  
6.	The nanopositioner/scanner combination must allow the sample to be held within 10 nm of a selected position for 100 s.
7.	The microscope probe head must include a cantilever mount with dither piezo and fiber optic interferometer readout of the cantilever deflection.
8.	A vector magnet system is required to supply magnetic fields up to 5 Tesla in both the vertical and horizontal directions.
9.	The temperature of the microscope in the magnet must be controlled with a precision of 0.1 K at arbitrary set points from 5 K to 300 K.
10.	Vibration levels must be low enough that the cantilever noise for an ultrasoft cantilever such as the BioLever B from Olympus (k = 5x10&#8722;3 N/m, Q=4500, f = 3 kHz) is dominated by thermal noise.
11.	The microscope must be supplied with all the control and power supply electronics for the nanopositioner, scanner, interferometer, magnetic fields, and temperature control.
12.	Control software for the microscope must be open, allowing users full control of the system components via LabView software.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a 234-bed biomedical research hospital with an active outpatient component.  The Department of Laboratory Medicine processes standard and specialized laboratory tests at the Clinical Center.  The laboratories housed within the Clinical Center process and report approximately one million test results per year.  Because of the unique research role of the NIH, there is also a need for outside clinical laboratory test services to support and augment in-house capabilities.  Off-site laboratory services support ongoing clinical research and clinical trials through the performance of unique or unusual tests.  Because of the research focus, each sample requires a high degree of methodological and reference range uniformity to ensure consistency over time.  Historically, the off-site laboratory services have performed approximately 28,000 tests per year.

g.  The offeror shall submit documentation of the experience with testing for clinical research and use of advanced test methodologies that provide optional data for research protocols, including any evidence of the ability to generate a database for human patient lab testing.	

h.  Past Performance/Prior Experience				

Past Performance
	
Past performance will be evaluated from a business and technical standpoint to determine the relative merits of the proposal.  The performance of the contractor on earlier work for the Government or the private sector will be a very significant indicator of how well the contractor can be expected to perform the required services in the future.  The information presented by the contractor together with that available from sources within the Government will provide the information for this portion of the technical evaluation.  References from labs with a similar lab set-up are requested at time of submission.

The Offerors past performance will be evaluated after determination of the competitive range of the proposals.  Only those offerors included in the competitive range will be evaluated. 

The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offerors past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

The assessment of the Offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the other competitors.  Thus, an offeror with the exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable even though both may have acceptable technical proposals.

Past performance will be scored, and the Governments conclusions about overall quality of the Offerors past performance will be highly influential in determining the relative merits of the offers proposal and in selecting the offeror, whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.

By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputations for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

The Government will consider the number and severity of an offerors problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offerors overall work record, and the age and relevance or past performance information.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.

2.	GENERAL RELATIONSHIP  TECHNICAL MERIT VERSUS COST

In the relationship of technical merit versus cost, offerors are advised that overall cost of contract performance will not be considered as controlling.  However, in the event evaluations result in substantially equal technical proposals, overall cost will be a major factor in selection of a proposal for award.   In the event evaluations result in acceptable technical proposals with a significant difference in technical weighting, overall cost will be considered but will not be major in making a determination as to which proposal offers the greatest value and is most advantageous to the Government.
	
      The vendors response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in the synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.

The Government will not award a Purchase Order or contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the survey of the Governments use of the information.

<DESC>The United States Army Program Executive Officer for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Targets Management Office (TMO) are seeking sources for an unmanned rotary wing helicopter target system.  The system will be used in live fire tracking and engagement testing by air defense missile systems on Department of Defense and Allied Nation test and training ranges, within the United States and overseas. The TMO is interested in adding low cost helicopter target presentations to its current capabilities. The target should be completely independent of any external power requirements; be capable of operating in harsh range conditions; be fully transportable by road, rail, air, and sea; be capable of multiple target missions once set up at a range site; be capable of being maintained and repaired under field conditions by trained personnel with minimal use of special tools and test equipment; and be very inexpensive to operate. The target will be required to operate during periods of daylight and darkness and under Basic, Hot-Dry, and limited Cold-Wet climatic conditions. It will also be required to launch and recover in various wind conditions. The government is requesting the following information: Flight Performance (Service Altitude Horizontal Flight, Mission Airspeed/Altitude capability, Endurance, Position Accuracy, Maneuver capability) Payload (Payloads currently available, Weight limits and their affect on performance, Interior payload volume, Power supplied by vehicle) Target Signatures (Radar Signature, IR Signature, Active RF Emitters, Rotor system -number of blades, conventional, coaxial, and rotor speed in RPM) Target Control (Control philosophy, Control precision, Flight termination capability) Cost (Unit cost, Flight cost for tracking presentations). Scenarios for use of the helicopter which support the engagement by US and allied nation systems will include hover, attack, and ambush. These may be at high or low altitudes. The hover and attack may be masked or unmasked. These scenarios must be either executed directly or may be simulated by maneuvers such as a racetrack pattern that give the US system repeated presentations of the target under nearly identical conditions. Targets must be flown in a safe/controlled manner. Targets may be controlled by the vendors existing control system, and the airborne control/autopilot supplied with the helicopter.  Employment tactics will include:  Racetrack orbits at medium and low altitudes, Shallow diving attacks at a simulated ground target, Maneuver from concealed hover to attack in pop up missile launch and guidance, and Night time test operations.  The primary locations for target use are the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and McGregor Range on Fort Bliss.  Secondary use at other locations will be necessary. Likely secondary locations include Yuma Proving Ground and sea level ranges such as Eglin AFB and Point Mugu. Government Furnished Equipment: The Government will provide equipment necessary as needed to assist in executing planned missions. Equipment needed is yet to be determined. Information is requested from sources that have existing mature full scale or subscale rotary wing helicopters, or as well as sources with experience in similar/compatible systems who may be interested in providing helicopter targets to the government.  Any company with the expertise to provide the required target system is invited to submit their performance capabilities by 30 April 2009.  Sources should provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) including purchase price for existing target systems. Interest in providing operational presentations rather than delivering the system to the Government and ROM cost for these services should be included. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify potential sources for possible future requirements. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information should be submitted to Larnett Kent, Targets Management Office, Bldg. 3211 Hercules Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898 no later than 30 April 2009.  larnett.kent@us.army.mil

<CONTACT>Ms. Sally Aultman 703-432-4126
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking information from industry relating to the need for a Digital Battle Management Application (DBMA).  The DBMA capability must fully developed and require only minimal optimization, conversion or integration to function as a tactical software application in a Joint Global Command and Control System (GCCS) environment.  It must be compatible with off-the-shelf ruggedized laptop computers and be capable of touch screen functionality.  The DBMA capability must be capable of information exchanges with various tactical databases that are resident in other systems such as Advanced Field Artillery Data System (AFATDS), GCCS tracks and Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS).  These information exchanges may be achieved either natively or via the Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) multi-tier data gateway as an application extension.  DBMA must possess or be able to achieve full accreditation and certification for formal!  Authority to Operate and Authority to Connect within existing U.S. Department of Defense tactical networks.  In addition to the requirements for basic digital mapping, situational awareness and command and control (C2) functionality, the DBMA must:
-	Allow operators to conduct digital on-the-move planning with functions such as overlays, battlefield geometries and route planning.  -	Provide features to allow terrain-associated situational awareness that includes correlation between satellite imagery, digital topographical maps, digital tracks, and the actual terrain.  -	Possess the capability to be integrated directly with standard Marine Corps laser range finders, weapons systems and crew-served weapons stations.
DBMA will be utilized at regimental and battalion level echelons of command by staff members in standard Marine Corps vehicles while on-the-move during displacement of command posts and command operations centers.  The user interface must be sufficiently intuitive to permit operators with minimal training to conduct digital C2 operations.  These operations include but are not limited to transmission/receipt of digital orders, transmission/receipt of position-location information and transmission/receipt of digital reconnaissance data.  DBMA must also be capable of receiving and displaying live video data from manned and unmanned vehicles (ground and airborne).  
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to support a Department of Defense Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) initiative that encompasses a two-year test effort, commencing in fiscal year 2010.  A successful FCT may lead to transition of the DBMA capability into a formal acquisition program of record.  Data received from this RFI will help the Marine Corps determine which foreign companies and products will be evaluated under the FCT, and will ensure development of a complete and accurate Performance Work Statement, Performance Specification and a Requirements Traceability Matrix.  
INSTRUCTIONS AND RESPONSE GUIDELINES  
Responses are limited to a total of 15 pages and must be completed in Microsoft Word format.  Page size must be "8.5 x 11", font must be 12 point or larger, and margins must be at least 1".  Both sides of the paper may be used.  Each side is counted unless blank.  Briefly describe your company, your services, history, ownership, financial information, business size, and other information you deem relevant.  Supplemental service brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may be submitted.  We appreciate your response.  We will not divulge individual responses to the RFI outside of the Department of Defense.  This is not a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice or to pay for any information received. 
 Clarification questions must be received via e-mail by 4:00 p.m. on April 2, 2009.  Capability responses must be submitted via email to the Marine Corps Systems Command Contracting Officer by 3:00 pm on Thursday, April 9, 2009.  Clarification questions in response to the RFI and final responses to the RFI shall be emailed to Ms. Sally Aultman at sally.aultman@usmc.mil. The subject line should read RFI for Digital Battle Management Application.  Companies that do not have a mature, existing product need not respond.  NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  The government reserves the right to conduct vendor capabilities demonstrations to be scheduled at a later date.****************************************************

<p>Address any questions pertaining to this announcement to the points of contacts (POCs) listed above.</p>
<p>This announcement does not request any proposals at this time. The purpose of this announcement is to provide information on an industry day for the Metamaterials for RF Antenna Applications program (STROEB II BAA Call 2). The objective of this program is to demonstrate the utility of RF metamaterials technologies in advancing the state of the art in RF antenna technology. AFRL seeks to advance these metamaterial-based RF antenna concepts beyond proof-of-principle toward functional RF antennas well exceeding the current state-of-the-art. Three specific applications have been identified: (a) low-frequency antennas, (b) anti-jam GPS antennas, and (c) high-frequency telemetry antennas. For the low-frequency band (30-300MHz), the objective is to build an antenna that is significantly smaller than a standard antenna without sacrificing important functionality such as gain or bandwidth. For GPS antennas, the objective is to build a small jam resistant antenna capable of being incorporated into small UAVs. The vertically-polarized telemetry antenna must operate over the entire telemetry band (1.4-6.7GHz), have the capability to handle 70W peak power, possess a 3dB gain on the horizon to 0dB at the zenith and, ideally, be conformable to the airframe. The Metamaterials for RF Antenna Applications Industry Day will be held on 3 April 2009 from 0900 - 1300. Registration will begin at 0730 with the formal presentation beginning at 0900 at One Liberty Center, 875 N. Randolph Street, 14th floor, Arlington VA. The intent of the event is to provide potential offerors information on the program.</p>
<p>The event will be limited to interested representatives of U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Contractors only. No foreign participation is allowed. Contractor participation will be subject to the same restrictions specified in the STROEB BAA. Entities/Firms/Organizations are limited to two (2) participants/representatives per entity/firm/organization due to limited space. If you are interested in attending, please register via the online registration site https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=SEN37783. The registration deadline is Monday, 30 March 2009 and confirmation will be sent NLT Wednesday, 1 April 2009. Map information for the facility and local hotels will be provided within the registration site. If you have any questions regarding registration or conference location, please contact David Fishman at fishman_david@bah.com.</p>
<p>The Conference May Contain ITAR Data. No foreign owned firms or foreign nationals are allowed to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR PROPOSALS<br />DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME<br />ANY PROPOSALS RECEIVED WILL BE DISREGARDED</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Dr. Terry Schulze, 9 Evergreen Court, Perrineville, NJ 08535 for evaluation of efficacy of doxycycline hyclate palatable rodent baits formulated at 500 mg/Kg. for use in combatting Lyme disease. Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted by the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Although chemical pesticides and repellents are available to combat these disease transmitting pests, many citizens are hesitant about the use of these pesticides due to concerns about short range toxicity and long range health problems attributed to these chemicals. DVBID scientists have developed host-targeted methods of controlling disease vectors thereby reducing populations of infected rodent reservoirs and questing ticks. Development of new, environmentally safe vector-control methods is a very high priority for DVBID and CDC. Because these DVIBD-patented, host-targeted bait boxes and other host-targeted technologies use such small amounts of pesticides enclosed in a box, they provide an especially eco-friendly method of vector-borne disease control in a residential setting. This is a win-win solution both for public health and the environment. The latest development of host-targeted technologies comes as a new adaptation to the bait box technology. Initial studies were performed in DVBID laboratories. A novel doxycycline hyclate impregnated bait formulation was shown to be efficacious in preventing tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection as well as providing a cure for early established infection in a murine model of Lyme borreliosis. In addition, this doxycycline bait formulation, encompassing a bacteriostatic drug, demonstrated the unexpected result of clearing spirochete infection in feeding ticks. These data provide evidence for exploring alternative techniques to prevent transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes. These studies were performed at CDC, DVBID and have been accepted for publication in the Amer J Trop Med and Hyg. The projects for this requirement are as follows: Project 1: To evaluate doxycycline hyclate impregnated rodent bait in a palatable formulation. The doxycycline bait will be formulated at 500 mg/Kg based on the published DVBID laboratory study: Dolan et al, 2008. A doxycycline hyclate rodent bait formulation for prophylaxis and treatment of tick-transmitted Borrelia burgdorferi. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 78:803-805. The doxycycline bait will be made available to rodents and delivered in a childproof rodent bait box (Protecta LP rat-sized bait box, Bell Laboratories, Madison, WI) to determine the ability of this formulation to prophylactically protect mice, cure infected mice, and clear ticks feeding on treated mice of the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the agent, Anaplasmosis phagocytophilum in Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda, the primary reservoirs of these two vector-borne diseases. Project 2: To evaluate the ability of modified Maxforce Tick Management System (TMS) bait boxes that contain the acaricide fipronil and are retrofitted with Doxycycline hyclate proprietary rodent baits formulated at 500 mg/Kg. Bait boxes will be serviced weekly. The ability of this dual system bait box to prophylactically protect mice, cure infected mice, and clear ticks feeding on treated mice with the use of doxycycline bait and the ability of fipronil-treated wicks to kill ticks on rodent hosts and to significantly decrease overall populations of questing ticks that transmit the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the agent, Anaplasmosis phagocytophilum in Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda, the primary reservoirs of these two vector-borne diseases will be determined. The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline hyclate palatable rodent baits formulated at 500 mg/Kg. This will include but is not limited to all necessary equipment to perform rodent reservoir and questing tick evaluations. The vendor will need to have access to suitable tick/rodent/Lyme disease habitat with a minimum of 0.1 tick/m2 and adequate species of Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda. The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials, processing equipment, live mammalian traps (Sherman and Tomahawk), bait boxes, and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline impregnated rodent bait to reduce infected rodent reservoirs and infected questing ticks and fipronil to decrease tick populations in residential areas. The vendor will identify suitable test plots for each study, conduct weekly pre- and post-treatment flagging and trapping of animals in plots to determine the ability of these host-targeted technologies to kill ticks, reduce infected reservoirs, and reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases. Vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCID/DVBID, Fort Collins, CO. The DVBID contract PI will provide all additional equipment as needed to properly process and evaluate rodents and ticks for infection and assess serum plasma levels of doxycycline in target rodents (this includes but is not limited to: BSK, specimen vials, animal processing equipment, tick collection and processing equipment, HPLC and PCR analysis, culture and microscopy work, bait, bait boxes, data collection, generation, and evaluation). The DVBID contract PI will assist with all field trials until completed. The vendor shall perform the following tasks in the order shown: 1) Locate, measure, and stake a total of 4-5, 5 hectare plots for evaluating doxycycline hyclate impregnated rodent bait formulated at 500 mg/Kg for controlling tick-borne disease in rodent reservoirs in Perrineville, NJ. There will be 2 untreated control plots and 2-3 treated plots. One treated plot will contain bait boxes with doxycycline bait and the other will contain bait boxes with both doxycycyline bait and fipronil-treated wicks in modified Maxforce TMS bait boxes. These plots will be sampled 2 times at weekly intervals to determine tick density, rodent density, rodent infestation rate, rodent infection rates, and tick infection rates prior to setting out bait boxes with doxy bait with the following objectives being performed: rodents will be trapped using Sherman and Tomahawk live traps. All rodent captures will be processed for materials to by analyzed for bait efficacy as follows: anesthetized, ear biopsied, bled by cheek punch, physical measurements recorded, ectoparisites removed and placed in ETOH, ear-tagged, and released at the capture site. Ear biopsies will be surface sterilized and cultured in BSK-H media for detection of live spirochetes by dark-field microscopy. Tick pools collected from rodents will be screened for infection by PCR. Both sites will be flagged for questing nymphal ticks. Ticks will be individually screened by PCR for infection with Bb. (Secondary future analysis will include PCR for Ap). Both areas will be flagged for questing ticks. Collected ticks will be recorded and analyzed by PCR. 2) Trial 1, bait box placement will take place at the conclusion of the pre-treatment work: Set out bait boxes on treated and untreated project sites. Treatment site 1 will get 50 Protecta LP boxes baited with 500 mg/Kg doxycycline bait. Trial 2, Treatment site 2 will get 50 modified Maxforce TMS bait boxes with both doxycycline bait and fipronil-treated wicks. The untreated control sites will have no bait boxes. 3) All sites will be evaluated at 4 and 14 wk post-bait box deployment. A single Tomahawk and Sherman traps will be set in immediate proximity to each bait station. This equates to 100 trap nights/site or 400 total/night. The areas will be trapped 2 consecutive nights (800 trap nights/sample period). All captures will be anesthetized, ear biopsied, bled by cheek-punch, physical measurements recorded, ectoparasites removed and placed in ETOH, ear-tagged, and released at the point of capture. Ear biopsies will be surface sterilized and cultured in BSK-H media and read by dark-field microscopy for detection of live spirochestes. Tick pools will be screened for infection by PCR. (Secondary future analysis will include PCR for Ap). Whole bloods will be centrifuged, serum removed and screened by HPLC for determination of detectable doxy levels in plasma. Both sites will be flagged for questing nymphal ticks. Ticks will be screened for infection by PCR. All efficacy data will be recorded for each time point and data will be analyzed, statistical analysis performed, and written report provided to CDC. All laboratory and field work should be performed under GLP guidelines for future FDA/EPA registration. Animal work will need to be performed under an approved IACUC protocol so the data can be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The study will conducted using Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines as outlined by the FDA as CDC will attempt to register the methodology and the baits for Lyme disease control with the FDA. The baits being used are proprietary to Genesis Laboratories. The period of performance shall be 180 days. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M.

The sole source determination: is based on the need of the study, Determination of Nucleus Ultra Structure with Electron Tomography, for this Dual-Axis Tomography Holder (Model 2040), to collect high-resolution electron tomography data from delicate specimens, in a scientific collaboration between scientists in the National Institutes of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), and the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). These experiments promise to provide new information about structures. When a single-tilt holder is used to obtain dual-axis tilt data, it has been found that electron topographic reconstruction is compromised. Specimens are extremely valuable, and many days are spent in characterization. Only the Flexi clamp mechanism provided by the Fischione dual-axis holder satisfies this requirement.   

A specimen holder is required to perform electron tomography with the following essential features 1) The tilt range must be not less than +/- 70 degrees on two orthogonal axes (i.e., dual axis tilting) without removal of the specimen holder from the microscope column 2) The holder must operate with an objective pole-piece gap of 5mm 3) A flexible clamp consisting of an annular spring must securely clamp the specimen into the specimen cup. A dedicated tool must be provided to remove the flexible clamp as well specimen grids easily, without causing any damage to the delicate specimens. 4) Initially, it must be possible to fully rotate the specimen through 360 degrees so as to orient the grid bars, or a particular specimen feature relative to the alpha tilt axis. 5) A two position precision indexing mechanism must provide a capacity for 90 degree in-plane rotation. 6) The holder must provide a spatial resolution of 0.34 nm in all directions. 7) The specimen drift must be less than 3.0 nm per minute.  
                  
The offer must include complete copies of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial: 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212- (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and will be most advantageous to the Government, with price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation and Price. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions. This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement, by submitting a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, all responses received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition, is based upon responses to this notice, and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Oracle USA, Inc. for ProSight/Primavera Fast Track for Capital Planning and Investment Control Budgeting Budget Year 2011 Software Renewal and Maintenance.  The period of performance for this software renewal and maintenance is one year.  This commercially available software renewal will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  This software and maintenance is a continuation of software and maintenance provided in NRCs five-year contract with ProSight, Inc. for software and professional services to install and implement a Portfolio Management System.  Oracle USA is the sole provider of this software, having acquired Primavera Systems, Inc., which had previously acquired ProSight, Inc., the developer of this proprietary software.  The NRCs Office of Information Services (OIS) uses ProSight/Primavera Fast Track software for its Portfolio Management System to assist with the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) budgeting process and OMB submissions, Federal Enterprise Architecture, and FISMA.  OIS requires this specific software because of its prior substantial investment in this COTS software package.  If the NRC were to use an alternate software product, it would lose substantial work products that were derived from the use of the software under its contract with ProSight.  Switching to another COTS software package for OIS OMB Exhibit 300 and Exhibit 53 reporting at this point would cost the NRC substantially more than the cost of this software upgrade.  The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with Oracle is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334611.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRCs needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Manon Butt, Contract Specialist, via email to manon.butt@nrc.gov no later than March 31, 2009.  Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

<DESC>USAID/Peru seeks to communicate its intent to sole source a $5,000,000 procurement to support the Alternative Development program which is being implemented by Chemonics International.  The goals of this program are:  1) assist significant numbers of new communities and families to transition to a licit lifestyle after programmed eradication and 2) ensure the sustainability of the licit development gains made to date and commitment to licit lifestyles in the 800 communities of the 2002-2007 voluntary eradication program.  This program was  designed to consolidate voluntary eradication areas and post-programmed eradication alternative development areas.  

Through an increased investment of $5,000,000 the current work under this contract will be expanded to respond to the changing security environment in order to  programmatically reinforce  several geographic zones that have become more vulnerable to terrorism and narco-traffickers since the contract was awarded.  No new activities will be added to the scope of work of the contract.  This investment will support productive activities, social capital building and governability to consolidate USAIDs investment in areas that have become more vulnerable to illicit activities.  More specifically, this investment would include more supplies and materials for more hectares of licit crops and the related technical assistance for farmers, along with technical assistance and grants to governments and communities to strengthen social capital and governability.

The nature of the services required do not include standardized commodities.   Rather, they involve technical assistance and advice linked to politically and socially sensitive issues, such as coca eradication and integrated development in areas that were once dominated by an illicit economy and continue to present complex operational challenges in areas that have limited installed management capability.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.     This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONDUCTED UTILIZING EXISTING USPTO'S INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANITY (ID/IQ) CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.      

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure an upgrade to the existing brand name NetApp filers for the USPTO Enterprise Remote Access (ERA) environment.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification for NetApp FAS6080-R5 hardware appliance.

The USPTO ERA (Enterprise Remote Access) environment is a custom designed USPTO AIS that provides users with secure remote access to the USPTO enterprise desktop environment.  This allows users to access other AISs to conduct official business regardless of the users physical location. Instead of maintaining dedicated desktop hardware for each user, ERA utilizes VMWare ESX Server to virtualize several instances of desktop OSes on the same server while using mid-tier NetApp storage to provide server and storage consolidation. This design centralizes the administrative controls and reduces the physical and electrical footprint of the ERA environment without compromising the security requirements. 

Currently, the ERA storage environment is served by two groups of NetApp filers. This acquisition is to upgrade the two pairs of FAS980c Clusters (4 filers total) which provide LUN level access to the ERA VMWare ESX server farm, which hosts the virtualized desktop OS images. OS images include the users C: drive which contains locally installed applications and the My Documents folder.   It has been determined to be more cost effective to upgrade the existing solution without replacing all the backend configurations and storage.  This is the most cost effective solution to maintain this mission critical application.  An award to another source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>Sandia National Labs seeks participation in the second meeting on fault-tolerant spaceborne computing using new technologies to take place from May 26-29, 2009 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The workshop's vision will be next generation spaceborne computing employing hardened versions new technologies being introduced by the commercial sector, such as multi-core, accelerators, FPGA, nano memories, and interconnect. In the near future, an engineer will be able to give a mission much more on-board compute capability by deploying a mixture of emerging power-efficient components. The components will be compatible with each other due to choices and system architectural standards developed by this workshop and subsequent activities. The workshop will also discuss the adaptation of parallel, heterogeneous software tools from the commercial sector to the envisioned space hardware. The implications of evolving microelectronic technology on the physical processes of radiation hardening will be a key topic as well.

Overall, the goals of the workshop will be to benchmark the current state of the art and technology roadmaps, and assess projected future needs and gaps.

Due to space limitations, attendees must obtain an invitation before attending. Qualified attendees may obtain an invitation and more information from Erik DeBenedictis, (505) 284-4017 or erikdebenedictis@sandia.gov

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue, Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for emergency Medicar transportation services for the VA Hines Hospital.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis SCR Medical Transportation for a one month interim contract.3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  VA Hines Hospital has a requirement for Emergency 24 hour Medicar Transportation Services for transportation to and from North of Hwy 38 and Indiana/Michigan.   4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs are Unusual and Compelling Urgency based on the fact that the current transportation contract will expire on February 28, 2009 without further provisions to extend and the new contractor can not perform services until April 1, 2009.  It is for the betterment of patient care to procure transportation services from SCR Medical Transporation.  5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The Contracting Officer had issued a solicitation for transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  Proposals were received and evaluated.  The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) recommended awarding the contract to a firm.  Services are currently being provided to Hines VA Hospital by that firm.  The Contract Review Board (CRB) concluded that there were deficiencies in both of the proposals that were evaluated by the SSEB and that the SSEB was not consistent in following the prescribed Source Selection Plan.  Although the written intent of the solicitation was to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, due to proposal deficiencies, the CRB determined that discussion would be necessary.  However, in the course of the CRB meeting it was further determined that discussion and subsequent award would not meet VA's goals for transportation of veteran patients.  The final decision of the CRB was for the Contracting Officer to cancel the solicitation and during the interim; the following plan would be followed until a one year with two one-year options contract can be established:	Extend the current contract through February 28, 2009 to allow for emergency contracts to be awarded. 	Issue a RFQ to three known contractors due to urgent and compelling needs at VA Hines.  Past history and current performance indicators suggest that the transportation needs of VA Hines exceeds the capacity of a single provider.  By utilizing numerous contractors, it is the expectation that each of the contractors would be able to better utilize their resources in responding to scheduled daily trips.  The three emergency contracts will be issued by geographic areas:o	North of Highway 38o	South of Highway 38o	Indiana/Michigan	Establish competitive BPA with a minimum of four (4) small businesses to handle all unscheduled or add-on trips.  The current contractor provides approximately 3,000 trips per month.  The trips are scheduled 24 hours in advance.  When additional trips are added to the schedule it results in delays.  The BPA providers will only be used for transport of patients who were not scheduled 24 hours in advance.  This will eliminate waiting times for patients.Page 2The emergency contracts and BPA will be awarded for six months which is the estimated time for the Contracting Officer to award a new contract.  A solicitation was issued to procure the services of a Transportation Consultant.  These services will include:	Evaluate current contractor provided Patient Transportation Services Program	Evaluate implementation and monitoring of the resulting contract	Develop Statement of Work of the resulting contract	Develop performance monitors and standards	Develop Standard Operating Procedures	Baseline, bi-weekly, final written assessments	Quarterly reports	Site visits  The need for this emergency purchase order is essential in order to prevent service interruption.6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  There are currently three (3) firms who responded to a recent solicitation to provide transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  SCR will be issued an emergency purchase order for one month until the 6-month contract commences on April 1, 2009.7.

Scope of Work
Tax-Deferred Defined Contribution Plan Services
For
U.S. Personnel Services Contractors-(USPSCs),
United States Department of State

A. INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY

US Department of State (DOS), Bureau of International Narcotic and Law Enforcement (INL), Overseas Building Operation, and Diplomatic Security require record keeping/administrative and investment management services for its start-up tax deferred defined contribution plan, equivalent in design and function to an Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401 (k) plan. DOS intends for contributions to the Plan to begin no later than June 15, 2009. The record keeping/administrative contractor must provide daily valuation. The investment management services contractor must provide a minimum of at least 5 diversified investment options and at least 3 of these must represent materially different risk characteristics.

Department of State (DOS) has a centralized payroll processing for paying personal services contractors (USPSC's). Payroll is processed at the Global Financial Service Center, located in Charleston South Carolina. DOS uses a proprietary payroll software application for payroll operations. USPSC's submit their time and attendance (T&A) sheets on a bi-weekly schedule to their designated time keepers who submits them to the financial service center payroll office. Upon receipt of the T&A, the payroll office calculates gross pay, all deductions, and net pay amounts. The payroll systems is expected to be able to accommodate typical 401{k) plan processing requirements (accomplishing withholdings, reporting to employees bi-weekly on taxable and non-taxable wage amounts, and producing appropriate W-2s.

OBJECTIVE
DOS requests proposals from contractors interested in providing investment fund management, enrollment, and recordkeeping/administration services for the operation of a tax-deferred defined contribution plan (meeting the requirements of a 401(k) plan) which will benefit personal services contractors (PSC's) working for the DOS. DOS does not contribute any matching funds to participant investments and does not reimburse any investment management, trustee, administration/record keeping, and compliance charges for the Plan. There are about 600 -650 personal service contractors who are eligible to participate in the Plan. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a private letter ruling allowing this Plan. The IRS  must provide final approval for the selected plan. 


Because USPSCs cannot participate in programs administered by OPM they are not eligible for Federal retirement or the Thrift Savings Plan. However, under current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, they are considered  employees of DOS. (Note:  As an employee for purposes of Section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 USC 2396(a)(3), the Contractor is generally an employee of the United States for purposes of laws other than those administered by the Office of Personnel Management (i.e., Title 5, United States Code).  This includes being an employee of the United States for purposes of Title 26, United States Code, which subjects the Contractor to withholding for both FICA and Federal Income Tax, and precludes the Contractor from receiving the foreign earned income tax exclusions of 26 USC Section 911.)


Thus, PSCs are not eligible to participate in other tax-deferred retirement plans (TSP, 401{k), SSP/IRA's) with the exception of Individual Retirement Accounts. Supporting this, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (General Counsel), stated that without legislation that specifically addresses the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), USPSCs can not be made eligible to participate in the TSP.
Within the last few months, however, the IRS (Manager Employee Plans) has issued a letter ruling in response to DOS's request, "that the IRS rules that DOS may establish a 401(k) plan on behalf of USPSCs. The ruling that was issued states that DOS can, in fact, establish a 401(k) plan for USPSCs, who are "employees" under the relevant IRS definition.

<DESC>Hot water boiler is severely corroded
Findings:
The boiler that produces domestic hot water for the building is in very poor condition and needs to be replaced or removed from service as soon as possible.  The lower portion of the boiler housing including stands and the burner area are severely corroded and some layers are falling off.  The propane-fired boiler is Weben Jarco model AJH WB50 with 500 MBH input and 400 MBH output capacity.  There is no back up boiler in the building.

Recommendations:
Provide a propane-fired water boiler replacement of the same output capacity.  The new boiler should have a high efficiency rating available at the time of purchase.  The boiler shall be complete with controls and burner.  Replace sections of any gas, water and drain piping within the immediate vicinity of the existing boiler if their condition is questionable.  Insulate all hot water piping provided.  Reuse the flue if it si in good condition.  

A walk-thru is scheduled for April 1st, 2009, Wednesday, at 10:00 a.m.

If needed, site vistis will be done by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ)-Dallas has a requirement for translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of Rwandan documents.  Services may include other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda.  ICE requires the translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of various documents and interviews in Kinyarwanda and other languages of the African Great Lakes region.  Certain documents will require some degree of formatting.  Many documents will require certification that they comport with 8 CFR 1003.33.  Rwandan documents are frequently written in the native language of all Rwandans, Kinyarwanda.  ICE requires that the relevant documents be translated from Kinyarwanda to English with a hard copy in word format.  Vendor must possess the ability to provide an accurate word or phrase in another language (English) that is equivalent to that of the original language (Kinyarwanda).  Additionally, ICE requires the transcription of witness interviews conducted in Kinyarwanda.  Vendor must possess the ability to write out an exact copy of audio media from the language spoken on the media (Kinyarwanda) to another (English).  The resulting transcripts must then be translated from Kinyarwanda into English.  Some of these translations must be certified for use in court.  ICE may also require the transcription of witness interviews conducted in other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda.  ICE will also require interpreter services for conversations between ICE personnel and Kinyarwanda speakers.  Vendor must possess the ability to carry out oral translation from one language to another.  These conversations may range from very brief (minutes in the case of telephone messages and scheduling conversations) to long (several hours in the case of witness interviews). ICE may also require interpretation of conversations between ICE personnel and speakers of other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda. Some of the Kinyarwanda documents need to be examined by a Kinyarwanda translator who is familiar with Rwandan local court records so that the expert can determine which of the many records warrant translation into English.  Vendor must possess the ability to conduct a careful examination or scrutiny of the documentation to determine suitability.  After vetting of documents, the relevant documents require translation into English.  Some of these translations must be certified for use in court.  Interested vendors are to provide summary of experience in translating Rwandan to English and past performance information. The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a Base Period of Performance of twelve months and four (4) option periods consisting of twelve months each.  Translations and Interpretation Services, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541930.  Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.  This solicitation is set-aside 100% for small business.  The resultant award will be based on best value to the Government, which may or may not result in accepting the lowest priced offer.  This solicitation will be issued via Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.Gov) only.  Notification of amendments shall be made via FedBizOpps.Gov only as well.  It is therefore the contractor's responsibility to check https://www.fbpo.gov/ daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures.

Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals for basic, in-home digital-to-analog converter box installation services.  Such services are composed of the following elements: connecting up to two of a households existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TVs, providing a basic level of orienting/reorienting the households antenna(s) and scanning/rescanning the converter box(es) in order to receive digital broadcast TV stations in the area, and providing basic guidance to the consumer on the operation of their converter box(es). Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities.   

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). 
The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW).

Two loop cable assemblies, stored in bins in the RALS container, are laid out in the area to be lighted, and connected to output receptacles on the RALS. The total length of each loop assembly is 750 feet. At 125 feet intervals along the loop cord, one-fixture light assembly is mounted on 15 feet high support poles.<BR>One light assembly mounts directly to the RALS container. These items are also stored in the container.<BR>The fixtures are connected to receptacles on the loop cable assembly. A photoelectric cell on the RALS, or the manual bypass toggle switch, controls the application of power to the lights. The RALS is designed for safe operation and conforms to the NEC for outdoor use.<BR><BR><BR>			<BR> <BR>CLIN   0002          Qty  2 each                              $_____________<BR>                      <BR>                                           Primary Distribution Panel (PDP)<BR><BR>Two PDP models are available to meet distribution requirements; the Class L Connector 25kW PDP, Model 1R0420-1, and the Commercial Connector 25KW PDP, Model 1R0420-2. The PDP models differ only by the type of connector used, i.e., Class L or commercial connector. The PDP distributes 1-phase and 3-phase low voltage electrical power from a 120/208 Volt AC (VAC) power source such as a DPGDS Secondary Distribution Center (SDC), or a Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG), to various facility applications. The PDP receives 120/208 VAC power from a power source and distributes 120/208 VAC 3-phase or 120 VAC 1-phase power to connected loads.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>CLIN 0003          QTY   2 each                             $_____________<BR><BR>			     Secondary Distribution System (SDS)<BR><BR>The function of the Secondary Distribution Center (SDC) is to accept primary power and reduce the voltage for distribution. Primary power can be either from a commercial power plant, engine driven prime power generator sets, or from another SDC.<BR>The SDC is designed to accept primary power at 4160VAC, 60Hz, or 3800VAC, 50Hz, 3-phase from any source utilizing Load break Elbows and reduce the voltage (by a 150kVA transformer) to 120/208VAC, 60 or 50Hz, 3-phase for distribution.<BR>The SDC is used to provide power for equipment requiring 120/208VAC electrical power. The SDC is also equipped with two (2) additional sets of Medium Voltage Output Load break Elbow connections (bushing wells). These connections are used for parallel operations with additional SDCs, forming a common bus.<BR>The SDC can also accept secondary power from a Mission Essential Power (MEP) generator set. MEP generators feed through a circuit breaker to the secondary bus. The breaker is interlocked to prevent inadvertently feeding the secondary bus from two power sources. Electrical power distribution consists of circuit breakers feeding pin and sleeve type connectors which permit connecting the secondary cable feeders which in turn feed out to the load centers. The pin and sleeve connectors are designed to meet MIL-C-22992 or commercial equivalent specifications.<BR>       <BR>     The equipment is designed for safe operation and it conforms to the National Electric Code (NEC) for outdoor use. The phase rotation is A, B, C for the Secondary Output Circuit. See Appendix C for the schematic diagrams of the electrical systems for all 4 SDC models. See Appendix A for listing of components supplied with the SDC.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).   Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule.  The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only.  The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary.  Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period.  The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both.  When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation.  A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided.  Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period.  To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option.  In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.  The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.  However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the antiipated release date of solicitation from 3 April 2009 to 27 March 2009.  In addition, the following is a list of Questions, with answers, received for this requirement.<BR><BR>1.  Question:  Can you send me the RFP? <BR>Answer:  The RFP has not been released as yet.  The anticipated release date is 3 April 09, as indicated in the pre-solicitation notice dated 12 Mar 09.  Mission Installation Contracting Command will not be issuing hard copies of the solicitation. Perspective offerors must download the solicitation, once it is released, for use in preparation of their proposal.<BR><BR>2.  Question:  How can we submit our bid for this requirement?<BR>Answer:  The anticipated release date for the solicitation is 3 April 09.  All proposals must be submitted as instructed in the solicitation, Addendum 52.212-1.  <BR><BR>3.  Question:  Will you be sending out solicitations?<BR>Answer:  No.  Mission Installation Contracting Command will not be issuing hard copies of the solicitation. Perspective offerors must download the solicitation, once it is released, for use in preparation of proposal.<BR><BR>4.  Question:  What is the performance period?<BR>Answer:  The period of performance is indicated in the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.2, 22 April 09  26 May 2009.<BR><BR>5.  Question:  Do you have a preference in location, i.e. suburb, downtown?<BR>Answer:  In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.1, facilities must be located within a 10 mile driving distance from 5250 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22304. <BR><BR>6.  Question:  What is the Quantity of rooms needed?<BR>Answer:  Rooms requirements are outlined in detail in Section 1.1 of the Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>7.  Question:  How many rooms do you need per night?<BR>Answer:  In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.2, rooms will be needed for the entire period of performance, 22 April 2009  26 May 2009.  The numbers of rooms are noted in the performance work statement, Section 1.1.<BR><BR>8.  Question: Is the exact breakdown of rooms available on FedBizOpps?<BR>Answer:  Yes.  The exact breakdown of rooms is indicated in the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.1.<BR><BR>9.  Question:  What is the lowest possible number of rooms we could commit to? There is a rumor going around that its a 24 room minimum.<BR>Answer:  There are not a minimum number of rooms required.  Offerors are not required to propose on all line items, or on the entire quantity of each line item.  More information will be given in the solicitation, Addendum 52.212-1.<BR><BR>10. Question:  Our hotel is conveniently located to many of Washington's major attractions (including the Pentagon) and the Rosslyn Metro Station (subway). Will these accommodations work for you?<BR>Answer:  Details of location requirements are given in the performance work statement, Section 1.1. <BR><BR>11. Question:  I saw in one of the paragraphs it was noted that no hotel can have more than 50 rooms for your group.  However, I also saw the noted exception for small business.  Are we able to house your 98 room group at one location or at various locations with a max of 50 rooms per hotel? <BR>Answer:  In accordance with Performance Work Statement, Section 4.1Under the Threat Protection travel guidelines, maximum number of units per location shall not exceed 50.  This requirement is 100% set-a-side for small businesses.<BR><BR>12. Question:  Location of 5250 Duke Street is Windsor Apartment locations.   I believe that is the location of the incumbent contractor.   My question is, Is requirement of the 98 units an additional need to the existing contract?<BR>Answer:  No, this is a separate requirement. <BR><BR>13. Question:  A previous JADOC requirement posted in December of 2008 requesting similar needs was cancelled.  That requirement was for 12 months leases.   My question is, Is there any chance this requirement there would be an extension beyond the 4/22-5/26?<BR>Answer:  No.  The period of performance will be 22 April  26 May 2009 as stated in the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.2.<BR><BR>14. Question:  The bed types indicated the following: 52-One Bedroom sleeping units, with a minimum of two full size beds or larger (Would two twin beds meet the requirement?) 24-Two Bedroom sleeping units, with a minimum of three full size beds or larger (Would again two twin beds meet the requirement in one of the bedrooms?)<BR>Answer:  No.  The bed type requirement as indicated in the Performance Work Statement, Section 1.1: The only acceptable sleeping furnishing is a full size or larger mattress with box spring and frame, as indicated in the performance work statement, Section 1.3 <BR><BR>15. Question:  The above listed Small Business Set-aside does not offer sufficient protections and opportunity for a Service Connected Disabled Veteran Owned Business. Can the Set-Aside be modified from Total Small Business to SDVOSB only? I believe that that modification will provide sufficient protections IAW congressional intent and Executive Orders.<BR>Answer:  No.  Based on preliminary market research conducted, there would not be adequate competition if set aside solely for SDVOSB. The set aside will remain as 100% small business, which does not preclude a SDVOSB from submitting a proposal.  <BR><BR>16. Question:  Our Studio/One-Bedroom units sleep with a QUEEN/KING bed + a DOUBLE sofa bed sleeper; will this suffice the request for two beds?<BR>Answer:  No.  In accordance with the performance work statement, Section 1.3, The only acceptable sleeping furnishing is a full size or larger mattress with box spring and frame. <BR><BR>17. Question:  Is this bid only for small businesses?  <BR>Answer:  Yes.  This requirement is 100% set-a-side for small business.<BR><BR>18. Question:  If the facilities cannot provide in room stove/range top and utensils, can they provide a common area room with those facilities as well as an eating area?<BR>Answer: No.  Facilities must meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement, Sections 1.3 and 1.4.  <BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR COPY OF A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The United States (US) Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Office of Contracts (CON) is conducting a market survey to determine the existence of sources to meet an anticipated multi-year BBG requirement for a range of FM broadcast transmission systems and related support equipment for deployment worldwide. The Government contemplates awarding one (1) or more firm-fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) with each having one (1) Base Year period with four (4) 1-year options to extend the contract term, subject to the availability of funding. The IDIQ contract(s) will have an annual minimum dollar guarantee of $25,000 for the Base Year and each exercised Option Year, with a cumulative not-to-exceed (NTE) maximum dollar amount of $10 million that includes all issued task orders. It is projected that multiple orders of FM transmission systems will be made over the duration of the contract which includes the base and option years with the majority of task orders being issued near the end or the beginning of the Government's Fiscal Year. The BBG anticipates requiring FM broadcast transmission systems, including but not limited to commercial quality, highly reliable (with redundancy), solid-state FM broadcast transmitters (stereo/mono with exciters, output power ranges from 500 Watt to 20 kilo-Watt); antenna systems sized for the transmitter power and varying gain (directional, omni-directional, narrow-band and broad-band); combiner systems (2 to 4 input ports); transmission line systems sized to the transmitter power (flexible and rigid, connectors, hangers, adapters, hardware, grounding systems, cable pullers, patch panels, dehydrator systems); audio processing/monitoring equipment; equipment racks; automatic voltage suppressors, surge suppressors and uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) sized for the transmitter systems; studio-to-transmitter link equipment; shelter and tower systems; test equipment and test sets; installation, operation and maintenance documentation; and spare parts/assemblies. BBG will provide under a separate contract all program feed downlink equipment, shipping to overseas locations, and installation services. BBG anticipates that the post contract award task order process will be handled as follows: (1) BBG will conduct a site survey and provide the Contractor with site specific information; (2) BBG will work with the Contractor to design and provide BBG a proposal for a complete FM transmission system to meet the broadcast requirement based on the fixed-prices in the contract; (3) BBG issues a task order to fabricate/supply system; (4) Contractor delivers system to BBG Washington DC Headquarters packed for international shipment; (5) BBG ships overseas and installs the FM transmission system and program feed equipment. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes, and does not constitute a request for proposal, and is not considered a commitment by the Government. In addition, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for information or inquiry. However, the Government may limit follow-on procurement actions to firms that provide responsive submissions to this notice. Interested Sources (individual firms or teams) shall identify their business size (i.e., small, large, etc.) and submit a comprehensive written "Capabilities Statement" that provides, a minimum of three (3) copies of the documentation and information as follows: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE: (A) A minimum of ten (10) years of experience in the design and manufacture of FM broadcast transmitters and FM broadcast antennas, (B) A minimum of five (5) years of experience in the design and manufacture of all solid-state FM broadcast transmitters, ( C) A minimum of one (1) year of full-time commercial service for each model (e.g. power output level, coverage) of transmitter and antenna offered, and (D) Demonstrated experience in the design and supply of complete FM broadcast systems for deployment worldwide; (2) TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: Data sheets, brochures or other documentation clearly describing all proposed commercial FM broadcast system equipment sized for medium to large urban environments addressing the full range of transmitter power and antenna combinations stated above. (BBG understands that very few firms manufacture all the equipment required for this proposed contract. The response should describe how you have worked with other firms to provide a complete broadcast system package for the customer); (3) DELIVERY: A statement of the estimated delivery time in calendar days for their FM broadcast system(s) to be delivered to a BBG designated freight-forwarder location in the vicinity of Washington DC after receipt of award of contract /delivery order (The firm should state if there are variations in delivery time due to transmitter power, and/or system complexity and/or quantity including any conditions/assumptions); and (4) SAMPLE PROJECT PROPOSAL: The firm should provide a sample FM transmission system proposal including a technical description of the equipment proposed and price breakout by equipment line item for the following: (A) 3 x 5kW FM transmitter system carrying three separate FM programs, (B) proposed transmitter site location is Baghdad, Iraq approximately 10 kilometers Northwest of Firdos Square, (C) proposed transmitter site includes 150 meter tower with transmitter building 25 meters from base of tower. To be considered in this market survey a written "Capabilities Statement" shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts (CON), Switzer Building, Room 4007, 330 "C" Street, SW, Washington, DC 20237 by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT), April 27, 2009. Submittals may be made by courier; however, telephone responses are not acceptable. If determined to be in the best interest of the Government, interested and qualified sources responding to this sources sought notice may be requested to provide follow-up information. Contractors will be notified on whether their written "Capabilities Statement," as verified by the IBB is responsive to this notice. A determination to compete, or not to compete, this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.</p>

<DESC>Amendment #1 to Sources Sought #PR-HQ-09-11373:The following are questions received from interested vendors and the answers to these questions.

Amendment #1 to Sources Sought #PR-HQ-09-11373:
Question 1: The Performance Statement of work, Section III A. Geographical Location of Base and Areas of Coverage Requirements: The description provided as to the geographic location of base and areas of coverage requirement is somewhat unclear and central to a future response to this RFP (i.e. A three quarters of a flight hour distance from a point equidistance from Boston, MA and Chicago, ILL. is not in proximity to a one half flight time buffer from international waters of the Atlantic.)  Can EPA clarify the location by providing latitude and longitude coordinates equidistant between Chicago and Boston and a distance radius around this point expressed in miles?
Answer:  In the event that this sources sought becomes a solicitation, the government would not direct interested vendors as to where an established base should be.  That would be up to the interested vendor.  The Performance Work Statement is written to ensure travel time east to Boston is roughly equivalent to the time west to Chicago.  The specification regarding distance from international waters is to ensure that the fixed base of operations is sufficiently far from the coast due to the lack of incidents occurring out at sea.   Question 2: The Performance Work Statement Section III B. Personnel Requirements: This section specifies that  ? A t least two members of the staff shall be experienced with installing, integrating and maintaining equipment onboard the contract aircraft including integration with the aircraft's electrical systems .? Can EPA specify how many of these staff are required on a full time basis to rapid respond to flight missions?
Answer:  The Performance Work Statement does not tell a vendor how to provide the services specified.  However, the Performance Work Statement does require the vendor to be able to provide services for emergency response data collection flights whenever they are requested.  The purpose of the proposal is for the interested vendor to tell the government how they intend to provide the services.  Mention of the maintenance staff is included in the Performance Work Statement to ensure that the interested vendor addresses the issue of having qualified and experienced personnel available on short notice to provide repair/maintenance services as needed.
Please remember that this notice is a Sources Sought only, not a RFP.  If you feel that your company is capable of providing the services stated in the Performance Work Statement, please submit a capability statement along with business size according to the instructions listed in the posted Sources Sought.

<SUBJECT>Health Information Technology (HIT) to assist  the Social Security Administration (SSA) to obtain and manage structured electronic medical record (EMR) data.
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-09-0331
<RESPDATE>041009
<CONTACT>Kathleen I. Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659513, Email Kathleen.I.Jackson@ssa.gov
<DESC>This amendment is to publish the answers to questions received in response to the RFI and to extend the date for receipt of information to April 10, 2009 at 3:00 PM ET.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH into use of Health Information Technology (HIT) to obtain structured electronic medical records (EMR) data. 	NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. 

Background

In 1995, the Social Security Administration launched an effort to eliminate the paper processes being used at the agency.  SSA goal is to store all unstructured data in repositories residing on the SSA mainframes.  SSA currently receives medical information, in the form of images (paper scanned to TIFF images), from integrators and from our agency offices. This TIFF format electronic medical records (EMR) data is stored in our enterprise content repository for unstructured data and is used in processing SSA Disability Determination workloads. SSA applications supporting these workloads have limited ability to interpret and extract medical information from the TIFF EMR data. SSA and associated state employees must therefore view the TIFF EMR data in order to make a disability determination.

In the past three years, the unstructured repository growth has accelerated, data access has been extended to Internet, and support for unstructured data has greatly expanded. SSA now operates one of the largest document management systems in the world, and unlike most other major enterprises, data captured or created throughout the history of Social Security is still critical to todays business processes.

Description

The Social Security Administration is currently involved in a pilot with the health care community to explore the SSA use of Health Information Technology (HIT) to obtain structured EMR data.  SSA will be obtaining HIT data primarily from Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN). SSA is interested in receiving EMR data in structured text format, such as XML, to conform to HIT plus improve the efficiency of our disability processing. SSA believes the use of structured EMR data, as opposed to the use of unstructured (TIFF) data, has potential to improve the functionality of applications that process disability determinations. SSA anticipates that there will be a long period (years) when the Agency will be handling both old (unstructured) image data from legacy sources and the new structured EMR data from sources such as NHIN.  As HIT data standards improve, SSA ability to make automated decisions using structured EMR data will increase. 
  
SSA is seeking to identify firms able to provide software and integration solutions that will allow the Agency to obtain and manage structured EMR data in our repositories. SSA seeks information on firms with demonstrated experience in the use of both structured EMR data and image EMR data in the same business processes and applications. 

Specifically, SSA is interested in software products and/or integration companies that have experience in the marketplace with structured EMR data both:
    from the storage side (Repository), and 
    for the use of structured EMR data in business applications that need to interpret EMR data.  

Vendor Responses

IT integrators that have assisted large, geographically dispersed organizations develop, deploy and operate an Enterprise Electronic Medical Records Repository architecture involving very large unstructured data environments supporting large numbers of end users are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities and past experience in performing those services.  Software vendors with capabilities and experience integrating their solution into an existing system are also invited to submit information in response to this notice. 

All vendor responses should provide detailed accounts of:

1) The name of the customer company/organization to which the vendor provided the services. 
2) A reference contact at the customer company/ organization (name, title, email, phone number).
3) A description of the customer company/ organizations repository architecture prior to the vendors engagement
4) A description of what services the vendor provided to the customer company/ organization.
5) A description of the complexities, challenges, and duration of the engagement.
6) A description of the customer company/ organizations current repository architecture and how the customer company/ organization uses the current repository architecture to deliver services
7) A description and make up of the team that provided the services.
8) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost of the engagement.
9) If possible, information such as redacted copies of strategy documents and other deliverables which were produced during your engagements.  Where Client agreements preclude providing even redacted copies of the requested information, vendors may substitute topic outlines or tables of content for the restricted deliverables. 

Respondents should indicate whether their services/products are available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC).   

All responses must be submitted in an electronic format (compatible with MS Office 2003) via e-mail to the Contract Specialist. Faxed information will not be considered. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes. Simple marketing information, incomplete responses, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by the Government.  Electronic responses must be received by April 10, 2009. 

Again:  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. 

The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice. Information submitted will be used in SSA market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development Regional Mission to Central Asia (USAID/CAR), is seeking proposals to provide the services described in the attached Request for Proposals.  

You are invited to submit a proposal in accordance with the requirements of the RFP.  This procurement shall be conducted through full and open competition, under which any type of organization is eligible to compete.  The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  

Please consider the following information: There are not any registration concerns with the country of Kazakhstan.  However, the laws and decrees in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan require that foreign legal entities must be registered to do business within those countries. These procedures are quite lengthy and it may take up to a year or longer before an organization knows whether its registration is accepted by the host governments.  In Turkmenistan, implementing partners who do not have an existing relationship with the government have not been able to effectively function, though registration of foreign NGO branch offices is not a legal requirement.  Given the in-country operating environments for Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in relation to registration and presence, the offeror through itself, or subcontractors, or joint-venture members must demonstrate current registration in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and an established presence in Turkmenistan.  Information on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in such countries can be found through various English and Russian-language websites and NGO organizations.  We also encourage organizations which are registered in Tajikistan or Uzbekistan or have an established presence in Turkmenistan to express their status as such on the Interested Vendor List at www.fbo.gov to assist in making this information known to others.

If you decide to submit a proposal, it must be presented in accordance with the attached solicitation and received no later than 10:00 AM, local Almaty, Kazakhstan, time on the Closing Date indicated above at the place shown below. Proposals and modifications thereof, should be submitted with the name, street address, telephone number, internet email address of a point-of-contact who is an authorized agent of the offeror and Request for Proposal Number inscribed thereon, must be addressed to:
