<DESC>The AMCOM Contracting Center, on behalf of Program Director  Aircraft Survivability Equipment, intends to solicit a twenty-one (21) month Technology Demonstration (TD) program for a laser based Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) system to protect rotary wing aircraft from IR guided missiles.  The Government intends to release a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) program.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this DRAFT RFP.  This effort will be solicited on the basis of full and open competition.  Source selection procedures contained the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 15.3, shall be utilized to select the successful offer after release of the formal RFP.  Contractors pursuing award of a Government contract must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to being awarded a DoD contract.  Although no final decision has been reached at the time, the Government reserves the right and intends to exclude foreign participation in the solicitation and source selection process.  A hybrid Cost-Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price contract is being contemplated.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712.<BR><BR>The requirement exists to integrate a laser based CIRCM system to the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).  The need for a relatively mature system and the risk associated with unproven technologies has resulted in a change to the weight requirement and a proposed change to the acquisition approach for the CIRCM system.  In accordance with the new requirements, prototype B-kits for the TD phase must weigh no more than eighty-five (85) pounds.  In addition, A-kit weights for small rotary wing aircraft must not exceed thirty-five (35) pounds and A-kit weights for larger rotary wing platforms must not exceed seventy (70) pounds.  The TD phase will not support the development of new or high risk technologies that have not already been demonstrated in a relevant environment.  The intent of the TD phase is to develop and test mature CIRCM prototypes to demonstrate Probability of countermeasure (Pcm), reliability, and safety of flight performance.  During the TD phase vendors must deliver 12 sets of initial prototypes.  The first six (6) sets must be delivered nine (9) months after contract award and the second six (6) sets must be delivered ten (10) months after contract award.  The TD phase will culminate in a PDR that incorporates all lessons learned through testing into a design that can be detailed in EMD.    <BR><BR>The US Army intends to release the DRAFT RFP within two weeks of this synopsis and to subsequently hold an Industry Day to address questions and comments as a result of industry review of the DRAFT RFP.  Interested firms should submit all questions and comments on the DRAFT RFP acquisition approach, schedule, Performance Work Statement (PWS), and evaluation criteria in writing to eddie.whitfield@redstone.army.mil.   Detailed information about the Industry Day and the specific deadline for the submission of vendor questions and comments will be provided at the time of the release of the DRAFT RFP.  Interested parties should monitor the Army Single Face of Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Opportunities Web Site on the AMCOM Contracting Center Public Web Site for release of the DRAFT RFP and the formal RFP.  No telephone requests for the DRAFT RFP or formal RFP will be accepted.  If you are unable to access the ASFI Web Site, you may fax your request to 256-842-8029, ATTN: CCAM-OS-S, Eddie M. Whitfield or you may send your request by email.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Respondents should identify their company's name, address, CAGE Code, and whether they are a large or small business.

This procurement to AT&T Wireless is considered to be single-source to the major carrier based on the requirement for cellular communications and uninterrupted services within all 50 states, Washington, DC, metropolitan areas with a population of 100,000 or more, Continental United States (CONUS), Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), as well as international coverage for FAA/DOT employees stationed abroad and those who travel from their home duty-station to other locations in performance of duties for the FAA/DOT.  Each of the three (3) major carriers provide stronger cellular services in some areas that the other major carriers do not provide.  The effectiveness of FAA/DOT employees to complete job depends upon their ability to communicated and be reached at any given point in time and location.  Utilizing a single carrier for all communication requirements would result in possible lost service in those areas where a single carrier does not provide the best services, including coverage and signal strength, resulting in the potential for communication failures at critical times in various locations.
Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single-source procedures.
All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist for this acquisition, Randall L. Bratcher, at e-mail address randall.bratcher@faa.gov, or mailing address FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Aviation, Medical & Training Division (AMQ-310), P.O.

<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center has a need to implement a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Evolutionary Architecture Study (GEAS) of algorithms into avionics in support of the attached "draft" statement of work.  The work contemplated falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard of $7 million.
Potential vendors who submit a response to this public announcement will be evaluated using a tiered approach in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Procurement Guidance T3.2.2.A.9.  Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient. Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received. The tiered order of precedence (in descending order) for evaluating offers received in response to this SIR will be as follows: (1) Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) program.
(2) Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB);
(3) Very small business;
(4) Small business; and
(5) Other than small business.
Interested vendors are required to provide:  
(1) A completed Business Declaration form (attached to this announcement).  Note:  8(a) and SDVOSB vendors must submit their 8(a) and SDVOSB certification letters with their submission in order to be considered responsive; and 
(2) A capabilities statement that addresses the following evaluation criteria:
     a.  The vendor must describe experience in developing certified avionics.  In particular, the description should include experience in developing certified Global Positioning System (GPS) and/or Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) avionics.  Also, the description must address avionics designed and certified to meet the criteria in RTCA document DO-178B.  This description must be no more than 5 pages.
     b.  The vendor must describe experience in the GPS and the WAAS.  The description must address experience that is relevant to the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  This description must be no more than 3 pages.
     c.	 The vendor must include a Management Plan.  This plan, no more than 2 pages, must describe how your company will be able to accomplish the tasks described in the attached SOW.  If the vendor plans to work with a teaming partner or subcontractor, also include a description on how the work will be managed and how much work will be subcontracted.  All small business participants (SEDB 8(a), SDVOSB, very small business, and small business) must demonstrate adherence to AMS clause 3.6.1-7 (Limitation of Subcontracting), wherein at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor to "pass" this evaluation factor.
Once offers are received, the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above.  Each of the above evaluation criteria (2a. through 2c.) will be evaluated on a "pass"/"fail" basis.  Vendors must receive a "pass" rating in ALL criteria in order to be further considered for this requirement.
After evaluation of the above criteria is complete, a Screening Information Request (SIR) will be provided to those in the tier that the Government determines provides an adequate response.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made.
Only vendors who respond to this announcement will be considered for this GEAS procurement.  Vendors are cautioned that no further announcement will be made if the Government determines an award can be made utilizing the tiered evaluation identified above.
This is a new requirement with no incumbent. Up to three firm fixed priced (FFP) contracts may be awarded as a result of this announcement.  The period of performance for each award is 6 months.  All questions/inquiries must be provided in writing to AnneMarie Ternay, annemarie.ternay@faa.gov no later than 5/19/2011 by 2:00 p.m. (EDT).  Responses to this announcement are due no later than 6/7/2011 by 2:00 p.m. (EDT) and must be delivered to the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Acquisition & Grants Group, AJA-4A3, Attn:  AnneMarie Ternay, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405.  An original and 3 copies must be provided; in addition, a compact disc (CD) that includes the vendor's entire submission in.doc and/or .pdf is required.  Faxed or e-mailed responses will not be accepted.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this announcement. Therefore, any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the vendor's expense.  Prospective vendors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under the current announcements for "AJA - Technical Center (Atlantic City, NJ)".  It is the vendors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.

<DESC>NASA/HQ intends to increase the maximum order amount of contract NNH07CC90B withInnovative Technologies, Inc. (ITI), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source.  The NASA TV and Web services contract is an Indefinite DeliveryIndefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with task orders issued on a Cost Plus Fixed Feebasis.	Services ordered under the contract have exceeded estimates and it is anticipatedthat the amount ordered under the contract will reach the maximum order amount prior tothe end of the contract ordering period of May 31, 2012. To avoid a break in service,NASA/HQ is increasing the value of contract NNH07CC90B. This increase will serve as abridge	between the existing contract for NASA TV and Web services and award of thefollow-on contract which is anticipated to be awarded 1st Quarter of calendar year 2012.The solicitation for the follow-on will be synopsized in FedBIZOpps and on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitorthese sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.NASA/HQ TV facility is the broadcast center for NASA, with four publically availablechannels delivered by satellite and streamed at nasa.gov.  The contract supports thedaily operations, production and engineering services provided for NASA/HQ TV and avariety of design and technical services to support the NASA Home Page www.nasa.gov.   Abreak in service poses an unacceptable risk to the support of mission activities.  ITI,as the incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of the on-site facility, experience andpersonnel to provide uninterrupted services.   Due to substantial duplication of costsinvolved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, ITI is considered the onlycontractor that can meet NASA/HQ needs given the short period of performance before theaward of NASA TV and Web services follow-on contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of NASAs intent to award aone-year, with 1 one-year option, sole source contract extension to the IntegratedMission Operations Contract (IMOC).The Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) at NASA/JSC has developed a procurement strategyfor the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 timeframe.  MOD has determined that this will result in acontract extension to IMOC, which would be awarded to United Space Alliance (USA) on asole source basis.  This extension is designed to provide seamless operations support for the InternationalSpace Station (ISS) Program, and aid in the retention of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP)workforce until NASA can formulate new support requirements for the Multi-Purpose CrewVehicle (MPCV) and Space Launch System (SLS).USA has been the incumbent contractor for MOD flight operations services since beingformed in 1995 giving them a unique and intimate knowledge of human spaceflightoperations, capabilities and processes.  The USA workforce has critical skills that needto be utilized not only to continue support to the ISS Program but also to support newMPCV and SLS programs while requirements are in development.  Continuing with USA through shuttle retirement will aid in workforce stability andcritical skill retention during the transition from Shuttle to MPCV and SLS.  Failure tomaintain a stable workforce and preserve critical skills at USA during this time oftransition would have severe and serious impacts to the safety of the ISS Program and thesuccess of the MPCV and SLS Programs.IMOC provides flight operations, training and facilities services that are necessary toconduct mission operations preparation and execution for the ISS.  IMOC also includestechnical support to MOD for initial MPCV and SLS program requirements development.  IMOCwill provide MOD flight operations services to the ISS, MPCV, and SLS Programs.Specifically, these services include:  Flight analysis   Flight design  Vehicle consumables evaluation   Mission timelines and procedures development  Crew and flight controller curriculum development and training conduct  Mission operations (preflight planning, flight operations, post flight supportactivities)  Operations concept development  Flight rules and constraints  Support for requirements generation and assessment  Design evaluationThe period of performance of the IMOC extension is intended to be two years, with a baseperiod from October 1, 2012 until September 30, 2013, with a one-year option from October1, 2013 until September 30, 2014.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard for IMOC is 541712 and 500 employees, respectively.The anticipated release date of the IMOC extension RFP is July 2011.  The anticipatedproposal due date for the IMOC extension is August 2011.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications and approach inwriting to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 19,2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact USA directly.  NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The installation Ombudsman is:Melanie Saunders281-483-0490melanie.saunders-1@nasa.govAll contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail only) toJ.R.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services and related products to continue the development of a systematic process for the estimation of shrimp fishing effort in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA intends to establish a system of automated processes to improve the estimation of total shrimp fishing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the fourth part of an ongoing project to develop and establish a permanent shrimp fishing effort data acquisition program to be managed by NOAA Fisheries Service in cooperation with the commercial shrimp industry. The electronic logbook (ELB) methodology and technology was originally developed as prototypes by LGL Ecological Research Associates, Inc., (LGL), of Bryan, Texas, while a subcontractor to the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Foundation, Inc., (Foundation), under a series of financial assistance awards from NOAA Fisheries Service. The first contract included development, production, and placement of the first 50 ELB units and associated memory modules; development of presentation materials, and preparation for and facilitation of port meetings with interested parties. The second contract covered the purchasing of 200 ELB unit materials and associated memory modules; production of the remaining 100 ELB units and associated memory modules; assembly and placement of 100 of those units on vessels identified through scientific random selection processes; purchasing in the last four months of Phase II the raw materials of the last 100 ELB units to be assembled and placed on vessels in the first year of Phase III; collection of data from the first 50 ELB units and from the next 100 ELB units after they are placed; comparison of the ELB data with port agent records for the corresponding vessels, periods, and locations; facilitation of additional port meetings; development and refinement of the data base and algorithms for data comparisons; and reporting and recommendations to the Government, the shrimping community, and other interested parties on the findings of the data collection and analysis processes. Phase III covered the assembly and placement of 100 ELB units on vessels, production of 200 additional ELB units and associated memory modules bringing the total of units to 450. Also, Phase III covered the performance of analyses and reports on a quarterly and annual basis through the period of performance. The contractor will provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, supplies, and other direct items of expense necessary to perform the required services. The period of performance will begin October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, with 4, 12-month option years. Services include, but are not limited to: the purchase and assembly of parts and components to replace any ELB units on vessels identified through the established scientific random selection process for selecting vessels. This process will be provided to the contractor at the time of a contract award; using the replacement ELB units (furnished government equipment) to serve as a pool of replacement units to assure that once the original placements have been made, there will be no less than 400 placed and continuously operating ELB units at all times in offshore waters during the course of the contract period; purchasing and assembling the parts and components to add 100 units in inshore vessels in Louisiana; downloading and analyzing shrimp fishing effort data from all existing ELB units in operation throughout the course of the contract period; refining and improving the existing analytical software and algorithms to enhance effort estimates in order to provide a self contained fully functional operating system at the end of the contract period; providing quarterly progress reports and a final year end summary report of progress; developing operational manuals for estimating shrimp fishing effort from the combined resources of the ELB records and the landings data. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about March 18, 2011. All small businesses interested in receiving a copy of the RFP must submit a request in writing to Jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Shreveport Louisiana Medical Center intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the metropolitan Shreveport-Bossier, Louisiana area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about May 20, 2011, with a closing date for proposals on or about June 6, 2011.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about June 17, 2011.  Contracts will have a base term from contract award to September 30, 2011, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable at the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates awarding one fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract for this requirement but reserves the right to issue multiple contracts if required to meet the government's requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY.  Requests for copies of solicitation will not receive a response.  <br><br>The Joint Product Manager, Consequence Management (JPdM-CM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is conducting market research to identify potential sources that can provide mobile and/or transportable platforms that are able to integrate the following:<br>1.	Power Generation Equipment<br>2.	Environmental Controls<br>3.	Infrastructure for the installation of:<br>a.	Engineering Controls - Glove boxes, Fume Hoods, etc.<br>b.	Communication Equipment<br>c.	Analytical Equipment <br>4.	Integration options for securing instrument racks, tables, etc.<br>a.	Ease of installation and removal<br>b.	Easily accessed<br><br>JPdM-CM is interested in various sized platforms to satisfy user requirements for the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  <br><br>JPdM-CM is releasing this RFI as a follow-up to a RFI posted in April 2010. The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the intent of the CALS effort and to gather information from sources capable of providing platforms that meet the CALS requirements. <br><br>JPdM-CM requests that an information paper be submitted as part of the response. The information paper should address the following:  <br><br>1.	Describe your ability and strategy to support the CALS program both near and long term. What is your area of expertise? What facilities and support structure are currently in place and what is envisioned for the future?<br>2.	Describe your teaming strategy. Does your company have the in house capability to support the CALS program or will other companies be included as part of your strategy?<br>3.	Describe the company's capabilities and maturity. How is the company structured to support the CALS program in the near and long term?<br>4.	Describe the product's ability to allow integration of various equipment sets.  What design considerations will be necessary to integrate the anticipated components of the CALS?<br>5.	Estimate lead time, assuming all design considerations have been finalized, for:<br>a.	Providing 1-4 platforms of various sizes for prototype/testing<br>b.	Preparing production line for multiples of the same platform, up to 65<br>c.	Production of platforms (line item b). Estimate per platform or per groups of 8 platforms<br>d.	Retooling the production line for various sizes of platforms <br><br>The CALS is based on a modular mobile laboratory concept that will consist of deployable modules that can be tailored to the specific needs of the specific consequence management laboratory units, Service Commanders, Joint Task Force - Civil Support (JTF-CS) and Joint Force Commander (JFC). CALS will be a transportable, mobile, multi-capability Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNe) system of systems, based on open system architecture, and comprised of specific technologies to assist the warfighter and first responders in identifying CBRNe hazards. CALS will be a modular, scalable, interoperable, and operationally integrated, mission-driven material solution for mobile lab analysis.  CALS will take a modular approach with respect to a smaller, deployable footprint consisting of flexible, adaptable, testable, plug 'n play capabilities; reduced power consumption; lighter, faster, and more accurate analytical equipment; net-centric, interoperable communications linked with external systems; more efficient laboratory processes, reduced personnel staffing; and expandable laboratory design.  <br><br>The CALS will provide a means to detect and quickly identify CBRNe materials in clinical specimens, environmental samples, and food samples; analyze, and provide field identification of threat agents, and genetically modified agents, to include low level biological warfare agents (BWA), chemical warfare agents (CWA), radiological material (RM), nuclear material (NM), high explosive residue (HER), toxic industrial compounds (TIC), and toxic industrial materials (TIM); and provide analytical results in an expedient manner to assist commanders in making risk management decisions about force protection measures to minimize the effects of a CBRNe event and allow the force to complete its mission.  <br><br>Activities are currently underway to develop an acquisition strategy that minimizes the time and cost required to satisfy approved capability needs, and maximizes affordability throughout the program life-cycle. The CALS Program has successfully entered the Technology Development phase, with fielding expected to occur from 2015 through 2017.  <br><br>CALS capabilities will focus on:<br>  <br> 	Enhanced all-hazard sample analytical capabilities across CBRNe portfolios in order to increase confidence and sampling capability in support of Homeland Defense, as well as deployed CBRNe and high explosive detection equipment;<br><br> 	Information management via a net-centric approach with a common information backbone for reach-back to subject matter experts; <br><br> 	An open, industry standard, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) capability, that uses Internet protocols for seamless device plug-in; a capability that provides the ability to plug a device into a network and have it recognize that the device is there, as well as when a new device had been added. The architecture of Universal Plug and Play should allow for the peer-to-peer networking of networked appliances, PCs, and wireless devices. It should be a distributed, open architecture based on UDP, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Universal Plug and Play will enable the communication between any two devices under the command of any control device on the network.<br><br> 	Optimized operational readiness via:<br><br>o	The use of human-factors engineering to design systems that require minimal manpower; provide effective training; can be operated and maintained by users; and are suitable (habitable and safe with minimal environmental and occupational health hazards) and survivable (for both the crew and equipment).<br><br>o	The use of robust engineering controls that are user friendly; enhances sample pre-screening preparation, protection, and storage; increases personnel safety; and has a broad spectrum alarm capability.<br><br>The anticipated components of the CALS will include the following:<br><br> 	Analytical Component Suite<br>-	Chemical Suite<br>-	Biological Suite<br>-	Radiological Suite<br>-	High-Yield Explosive Suite<br> 	Environmental Controls Component Suite<br> 	Engineering Controls Component Suite<br> 	Power Component Suite<br> 	Diagnostics/Built-in-Test (BIT) Equipment (BITE) Component Suite<br>-	Provides the increased ability to launch on time, launch on demand, and improves the degree of supportability of critical components. <br> 	A power-on self-test that performs a comprehensive test. <br> 	A periodic test that assures the device has not become unsafe/inoperable since the power-on self test.<br> 	A self-test to discover whether the device needs repair or calibration<br> 	System of System Integration Support Component Suite<br>-	Communication Suite<br>-	Decision Support and Data Management & Analysis Suite <br>-	Embedded Training Suite<br>-	Software Applications Suite<br><br>Equipment must be capable of operating in an all-hazard environment for sustained periods of at least 72 hours without outside technical support for repair or operations.  <br><br>All firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.

<p>The purpose of this request is to gather information for planning purposes only from commercial firms that may be used to establish a pool of pre-qualified commercial subcontractors for the TFM Line of Business (LOB) in accordance with standard practice and procedure as outlined in the Committee's Operations Memorandum #21. (http://www.abilityone.gov/policy_memo/Ops_Memo_21_05.01.06.pdf)</p>
<p>Please note that the purpose of this RFI is not to make any specific contract/subcontract awards to a commercial firm regarding TFM contracts, but to gather critical information for future AbilityOne business development activities. It does not constitute an Invitation for bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation or a Request for Quotes and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>If you are a commercial firm that currently performs any of the services listed in the project description box above, we would greatly appreciate a response to this RFI to further establish the capability and capacity of commercial business for this LOB.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) is seeking to obtain information pertaining to the requirement described herein and to identify firms with expressed capability to fulfill a requirement.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />BACKGROUND:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is one of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) largest and most complex components with a priority mission of keeping terrorists and weapons out of the United States (U.S.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also has a responsibility for securing and facilitating trade and travel while enforcing hundreds of U.S. regulations, including immigration and drug laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">ACS is a collection of complex business process applications used by CBP to track, control and process commercial goods and conveyances entering the United States for the purposes of enforcing import laws and regulations and for the purpose of collecting duties and taxes owed to the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, the ACS FIPS 199 Security Impact categorization is High (Confidentiality), High (Integrity), and High (Availability).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also classified as a federal financial system, requiring compliance with all applicable federal financial laws and regulations governing the safeguarding of financial data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">It interfaces with Participating Government Agencies (PGAs) to electronically transfer data on import transactions for enforcement of additional federal laws and regulations and to collect import and financial statistics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interfaces are also operational to other CBP systems for further processing or information sharing.</p>
<p>ACS was originally introduced in 1984 and operates as an Online Application Processing (OLAP) and Decision Support System (DSS) system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bulk of ACS operates off of an IBM 2094-S28 mainframe and is comprised of interrelated applications and databases using COBOL, the CA Datacom database management system, and IBM's Customer Information Control System (CICS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">CA Datacom database table layouts are similar to COBOL copybooks containing 'occurs' and 'redefines'. Also, t<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">he ACS applications, for the most part, utilize CA Datacom's </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">high-performance record-at-a-time (RAAT)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> access method and do not use SQL</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The system uses IBM Websphere MQ Series for internal and external interfaces.</p>
<p>Today, ACS contains tightly coupled subsystems, which consist of over 4200 application programs that run on the mainframe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ACS consists of approximately 9 millions physical lines of code and uses 7000 MIPS, 2000+ transactions per minute, up to 6 million transactions per day and 200 jobs per night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ACS is used by approximately twenty-five thousand Government users throughout the country as well as approximately twenty-three thousand trade partners importing articles into the country, with a minimum of 4000 users online at any given time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, while ACS primarily operates on the mainframe, there are several applications using other technologies including Oracle Designer, JavaScript, MS-Visual Basic, Windows Server, IBM Websphere MQ, and Internet Information Service (IIS).</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>This is not an announcement or notice of solicitation issuance. This RFI is issued to obtain industry's input for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate to industry the government's requirements. The information being requested is for the government's planning purposes only, is not a request for any proposal information, and shall not be considered in any way as a commitment by the government for any purpose. Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associated with the submittal of the requested information. The government does not request any proprietary information be submitted. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC &sect; 552(a).</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS), is seeking sources for the upgrade of all hardware and software components of the installed radio control over IP (RCoIP) systems on two Forests in Region 4 which currently use the WAVE RCoIP Technology. These forests are the Bridger Teton, and Payette National Forests. This includes upgrading all software and hardware to current supportable versions as well as the installation of RAVIN compatible hardware on the Payette which is necessary to migrate away from multicasting on the IP network. The Bridger-Teton system will not include RAVIN compatible hardware and the system will remain as a multicast system. The successful offeror will be required to supply all labor, configuration, programming and testing necessary to create the infrastructure to have a functional RCoIP transport system on the USFS IP network. The final product system shall be fully operational on the above listed National Forests and will offer the ability for USFS employees to use a desktop software client to access their appropriate radio channels. The system is required to support all legacy hardware radio control equipment such as analog dispatch consoles and tone remotes.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Six National Forests in Region 4 use a Radio Control over IP (RCoIP) system known as the WAVE system. This system is a server-based radio control system which enables users to use a software program on individual PCs to access radio channels. These systems have been in place for many years and have generally been well received and quite reliable.</p>
<p>Several years ago, an Enterprise decision was made to not fund support contracts for the WAVE systems. The result is that the hardware and software of these systems is no longer supported by the manufacturer. One of the goals for this acquisition is to upgrade the hardware and software of the installed systems up to current, supported versions and to re-establish a support contract.</p>
<p>The USFS IP network has also evolved since the WAVE systems were first installed. The IP network architecture is now transitioning away from the traditional hub-and-spoke systems based upon point-to-point T1 circuits. These traditional networks allowed for Forest networks to isolate themselves from each other. Network architecture now necessitates the requirement to move toward new network technologies; notably migration toward multi-packet label switching (MPLS) networks. While this architecture allows for greater performance for the Forest Service's information technology (IT) program overall, it does have some negative aspects for RCoIP.</p>
<p>The current WAVE RCoIP systems use multicast technology to distribute radio signals and audio through the IP network. Multicast technology has worked well and met our needs but there are known vulnerabilities associated with using it when using MPLS technology. These vulnerabilities can result in the loss of radio packets in the IP network and degraded or unavailable radio system performance.</p>
<p>3. ACQUISITION HISTORY</p>
<p>All six WAVE systems in Region 4 were installed by Network Integration &amp; Consulting Services .</p>
<p>When the systems were first installed in Region 4 each Forest had its own server which managed the radio channels and user profiles. Each server only served the Forest on which it was located. This architecture is being replaced with Primary and Redundant servers. These servers will host all radio channels, all users, and all remote hardware on the Forests.<br /><br />This centralized-server architecture will allow for migration of other similar systems within the Forest Service and also for new systems. It reduces the number of discrete servers which must be maintained. The Primary/Redundant configuration allows for failover. As currently deployed, none of the individual Forest servers have any backup.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all hardware and software components necessary to provide RCoIP systems for these two National Forests named above hosted by Primary and Redundant servers. The Payette system shall move away from multicast technology, while the Bridger-Teton shall remain a multicasting application. The Contractor shall also provide and install LMR gateways and other hardware devices at all necessary locations to migrate the Payette National Forest radio channels to unicast technology. The Contractor shall provide all software and configure all components on both Forests so that the application is fully functional and compatible with current RAVIN hardware and software. The Contractor shall provide, install, configure, and test all components. The system shall use the existing USFS Enterprise network. The RCoIP transport through the IP network shall generally be configured as a zero-in, zero-out transport; that is, no gain shall be added by the RAVIN hardware.</p>
<p>5. RFI OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to identify interested parties capable of upgrading the current Forest Service RCoIP systems while maintaining compatibility with the currently installed NICS RAVIN equipment and software. Interested parties are encouraged to respond with a capabilities statement which is relevant to this requirement.</p>
<p>6. HOW TO RESPOND</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged reply to this RFI no later than Monday, 16 May 2011, 4:00 PM Mountain Time, by email to jjefferis@fs.fed.us.</p>
<p>Please use Microsoft WORD to record your responses and attach the WORD document to your email. The format of your response shall be as follows:<br />&bull; Font size of Times New Roman 12 or a font of similar size and clarity.<br />&bull; 8.5 X 11 paper with 1 inch margins on all sides.<br />&bull; While there is no page limit, overly verbose qualification statements are strongly discouraged.<br />&bull; Responses shall include a cover sheet identifying your company's name, address, telephone number, point of contact, and cage code. Respondents should also provide whether your company is a large or small business and identify if your company is an 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI).</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.



 Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&ISs Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&ISs Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Centers Hospital Information System (CRIS).

 

Purpose

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office announces a Sources Sought Synopsis Number, N00189-11-S-1914, to develop and execute all activities and procedures necessary to conduct an anthropometric survey of U.S. Navy sailors for Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility, Natick, Massachusetts.   The survey will comprise of all naval communities (sea, aviation, etc), deliver the resulting anthropometric database and summary statistics, and produce a final report on the project.   The survey will result in a comprehensive anthropometric database that represents the current US Navy population and all data collected will be in correlation with initiatives being conducted by US Army and US Marine Corps and for future use programs.

Background:

Anthropometric measurements are used to develop sizing systems to properly fit a designated population.
  Navy last surveyed their female population in 1988 and their male population in 1997.  Since then body dimensions of the US population have changed significantly, which adversely impacts the fit of Navy uniforms developed on the old data.  The proposed project extends the research from the Armys Anthropometric Survey II (ANSUR II) for applying a combination of fit data and anthropometric population data to the problem of developing effective sizing systems for Navy personnel (male and female).  Critical body measurements at a maximum of three fleet concentration areas shall be taken for the development of base patterns, grade rules, and sizing systems for dress, utility and protective uniforms.
 This survey will also include 3D scanning, since no data exists on the Navy population for design and modeling applications for personal protective clothing and equipment.

Survey Description and Contractor Responsibilities:  

The contractor will directly and physically measure 90 standardized body dimensions on each of 5000 Naval personnel using traditional measurement tools and methods; and in addition, collect a 3D whole body scan on each individual using scanners to be supplied by the Government.  The participants will be selected from approximately three fleet concentration areas in order to render statistically valid, representative samples of males and females from Active Duty and Reserve components.
  The computer aided design and 3D solid models of body curvatures and shapes shall be used to statistically validate the digital human models for cost savings, efficient design, sizing, tariffing, reducing acquisition costs for personal protective equipment.  The contractor will provide a methods and summary statistics report for clothing and possible equipment design guidance along with an electronic database comprising subject demographic data, traditional body measurements and archived scan images.  The contractor shall provide recommendation on a sizing system commensurate with industry practices; validate the new designed sizing system through a minimum of two fit trials at Fleet concentration areas by demonstrating its effectiveness with selected Navy dress uniform items.
 Lastly, upon acceptance of the sizing system, provide model forms for use in dress, utility and protective uniform efforts.  

The surveys will be executed in four phases: 1) Preparation and Validation of Methods, 2) Data Collection and Editing, 3) Database Development and Reporting and 4) Sizing system validation.  Each phase is comprised of several major tasks.  The first phase, Preparation and Validation of Methods, requires the development and validation of all methods, processes, technologies and documents to be used in the conduct of the survey. These include development of the measurement list, landmarks and instrumentation; establishment of the measuring sequence of body dimensions; development, integration, and validation of traditional and 3D data entry and quality control software and operational protocols.

The second phase, Data Collection and Editing, requires selection and training of the measuring team; collection of demographic data, ~90 traditional measurements and 3D whole body and head/face scans on each subject; implementation of standardized, validated on-site protocols for subject selection, processing, data quality and security; and overall management of hardware and software systems.

The third phase, Database Development and Reporting, requires final data editing, development of the anthropometric databases, publishing of summary statistics and submission of a final project report.

The fourth phase, Sizing System Validation requires fabrication of specific uniform items and analysis of the fit based on a sample size matrix for male and female uniforms, report of findings of the evaluation and purchase of model forms for use in future uniform design efforts.

The estimated period of performance for the contractual effort is 24 months from date of award.
The effort is unclassified.
  However, because data collection will take place on military installations, no foreign nationals may be assigned to this project.

<p><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) capable of performing the work described herein. The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of that information. No contract or other instrument will be issued as a result of this RFI.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) FHA Section 232 program is authorized by Section 232 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.1715w). It is administered by the Office of Healthcare Programs (OHP) to insure mortgage loans to facilitate the construction and substantial rehabilitation of nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care homes, and assisted-living facilities. The 232 program allows for long-term, fixed rates financing (up to 40 years) for new and rehabilitated properties and (up to 35 years) for existing properties without rehabilitation that can be financed with Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) Mortgage Backed Securities. In order to streamline the application process, HUD developed a LEAN process in 2008 for Section 232 applications. HUD's new LEAN process employs a standardized work product and process to obtain a consistent and timely result. As a result of the Section 232 program, the number of loan applications has continued to grow to the point there are in excess of 400 loan applications currently waiting to be processed.</p>
<p>The goal is to reduce the 232 Program "Queue" by approximately 200 applications within a period of six to nine months. The Due Diligence Analyst will complete all steps required by the associated Punch List and develop the final Loan Committee report/s and present the information contained in the report/s to the Loan Committee (LC) for consideration. Any deficiencies noted by LC in the quality of the report/s will require the Contractor to correct the report/s deficiencies before the report is accepted by the LC.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking qualified business sources in anticipation of a future requirement. DHS invites all interested businesses to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI). This Request for Information is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.
<p>This is a request for information only. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission; other than acknowledgment of receipt, if a request for an acknowledgement is requested by the submitter. This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service. DHS is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.</p>
<p>The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1. Background:</p>
<p>In the period after the tragic events of September 11, 2001 the requirement for a national information exchange and collaboration system became obvious. The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) evolved from a Department of Defense, state and local law enforcement program implemented in early 2003 for sharing information and intelligence. As the primary nation-wide information sharing and collaboration network, HSIN provides secure, encrypted information exchange over the Internet, is an umbrella for several specialized information exchange networks and services, and is a system of collaborative communication tools used in routine, daily functions for information sharing, collaboration, alerting and prevention in support of national critical infrastructure protection and threat mitigation as determined by HSPD 5 and 7.</p>
<p>The objectives of this effort are to provide overall program management, development oversight, technical direction, and program support for the HSIN. The success of HSIN depends on the coordination and cooperation of multiple agencies and personnel at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as the private sector. This effort shall support the need to ensure continued successful operation and expansion of the HSIN.</p>
<p>2. Purpose of this Request for Information:</p>
<p>This RFI is being published to identify potential sources capable of providing a program management support to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Applied Technology.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.

The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size) and business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business).

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
Requirement:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Amarillo, Texas that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2,900 contiguous rentable square feet of medical office and related medical space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,900 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for nine (9) years.  After the 4th anniversary of the commencement of the term of the Lease, the Government, at its sole discretion may notify the Lessor of the early termination of the Lease by giving at least 90 days written advance notice to the Lessor.  The space must be available for occupancy by 7/30/2011. The delineated area is within the city limits of Amarillo, Texas.
Other applicable requirements include:

"	Thirty-five (35) VA dedicated parking spaces
"	Full Service Lease Requirement (not limited to all utilities, janitorial service(s), landscaping, pest control, air conditioning, plumbing, elevators, miscellaneous).
The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Commerce, U. S. Census Bureau, Suitland, Acquisition Division Room 3J448-B Washington, DC, 20233<br />THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1. THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE, NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 611310 Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools with a Size Standard of $7.0M. The potential contract value is $250,000.00.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) is the most commonly used source of data for understanding health insurance coverage and its social and economic covariates at the state level. CPS has been the benchmark survey for state policy analysis and evaluation of health insurance coverage for more than two decades. While the CPS has been the prominent source of health insurance coverage estimates for states over time, the sample size and collection of methodological changes over time have made the data difficult for policy analysts to use.</p>
<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) began collecting health insurance information in 2008 and is a promising data source that adds many new dimensions to the picture of the uninsured in this country by providing local level health insurance data. This robust data source is critical to help states understand the impact of health reform laws such as the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) in 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010. The ACS has begun producing health insurance coverage estimates for the country, states and local areas on an annual basis with the first data release in August 2009.<br /><br />With just one year of estimates to date, the ACS data are still new to the policy community and many questions need to be explored. The Census Bureau can best respond to these questions by further examining the data relative to other sources that provide health insurance coverage in order to respond to inquiries and provide a needed reporting mechanism for CHIPRA and PPACA.</p>
<p>Due to burgeoning health reform efforts at the state level, the demands for credible data and effective translation of these data to the local policy context are particularly critical. States need a reliable, central resource for basic research, data dissemination and translation of the complex methodological issues underlying the CPS and the ACS.</p>
<p>The State Health Data Assistance Center (SHADAC), under the Regents of the University of Minnesota contract YA1323-08-CN-0057, has played an important role in evaluating the first set of health insurance estimates produced from the ACS. SHADAC's evaluation of the ACS has been a viable source of health insurance estimates at the national and sub-national level. SHADAC also developed and recommended a set of edits that improved the data quality of the ACS estimates and also increased their utility as a vehicle for examining issues related to health insurance and health policies. New needs based on CHIPRA and PPACA point to the importance of utilizing the robust sample size of the ACS. States are not yet comfortable with this data source, and many do not have the capacity to analyze such a large data set. The Census Bureau sees a need to provide assistance in helping the states to access and understand the ACS estimates. The Census Bureau knows of only one source, SHADAC under the Regents of the University of Minnesota, that has the capabilities to facilitate the sharing of information among states; help policy makers understand the unique characteristics of the uninsured; and provide assistance to states estimating health insurance coverage rates at a state level.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The Census Bureau requires a contractor to perform services to assess the state-level health insurance estimates for 2008, 2009 and 2010. This work will focus on understanding discrepancies in reported coverage between the ACS and the other major sources of state-level estimates (for example, survey estimates from the CPS and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)), and to provide technical direction for state health policy analysts as they utilize the ACS for populations covered or eligible for coverage under CHIPRA and PPACA.</p>
<p>Task Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. ACS Mode Analysis: Expand the mode analysis already underway with the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) file. Mode analysis has been performed for other survey questions and it is important to have this studied and documented for health insurance coverage. This analysis will address some of the debate about the use of state-specific program names in the health insurance question and inform the direct purchase analysis described below in Section 2.0. Furthermore, the research will examine any bias that may be tied to mode that may be relevant to health policy analysis. Weighted and unweighted estimates by mode will be examined. The analysis will require the use of the internal ACS file at the contractor's site.</p>
<p>2. ACS Direct Purchase Analysis: Conduct analyses of direct health insurance purchase responses in the ACS using three approaches, as described below in 2.1-2.3. These three approaches will be used because ACS direct health insurance purchase prevalence appears high, but there is no gold standard for the "true" number of people with direct purchase insurance. Thus, varied approaches will be explored in order to search a wide array of possible explanations.</p>
<p>3. Characteristics: Examine the characteristics of people with direct purchase health insurance across datasets (ACS, CPS, and NHIS) for the nation. Consider state level analysis for a select group of states for which CPS and NHIS have sufficient samples (NHIS analysis would involve using internal data). The selection of states will be agreed upon by the Census Bureau's COTR and the contractor prior to this analysis. Examine direct health insurance purchase estimates among policy relevant subpopulations such as children, people in poverty, and minority groups.</p>
<p>4. ACS Specific State Level Analysis: Compare health insurance coverage estimates among states that have implemented major reform initiatives, such as an insurance exchanges (Massachusetts, for example) and Medicaid expansion programs (Wisconsin, for example). This analysis will focus on coverage estimates in states with low uninsurance rates, looking particularly at direct purchase estimates versus employer-sponsored and public program estimates. Where applicable, analysis will focus on subpopulations that have been directly targeted by policy initiatives, such as children and low-income populations to examine the impact of these initiatives on direct health insurance purchase reporting.</p>
<p>5. ACS Question Design: Consult with the Census Bureau and recommend a strategy to test changes to ACS health insurance questions in light of the direct purchase evaluation and implementation of federal health reform by the states. The changes to ACS health insurance questions to consider may include moving direct purchase to the bottom of the question list, adding qualifiers to the question sub-parts, and adding an item or altering text to clarify purchase through an exchange.</p>
<p>6. Coverage of Young Adults: Analyze state-level health insurance coverage estimates for young adults in both the ACS and CPS to establish baseline information (establish current health insurance estimates prior to enactment of changes so the impact of changes will be measureable) in light of the expansion of dependent coverage due to the implementation of federal health reform. Investigate how employers provided coverage changes for this group over time; comparing 2008, 2009 and 2010 estimates.</p>
<p>7. Coverage Error: Rates of health insurance coverage vary by geography, in particular urban versus rural areas. One possible reason for discrepancies between surveys is that a survey sample may not be exactly representative of the U.S. population, either for the whole country or a particular area within the U.S. This analysis will investigate the possibility that biases in the ACS or CPS sample affects health insurance coverage estimates and, if evidence supports this, how children and low-income subpopulation estimates are impacted. Measurement of students residing in college dormitories will also be investigated. The analysis plan will restrict the ACS to the sampling geography used by the CPS and utilize both descriptive and controlled comparison of estimates, including a specific assessment of direct purchase. This is an important unanswered question for researchers and health policy analysts to provide an understanding of differences between the CPS and ACS.</p>
<p>8. Linking Project: ACS-Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS): Recently a set of papers were released on the Census Bureau's website that discussed Medicaid under-reporting by examining survey data matched to Medicaid administrative data (MSIS). This work was the result of a partnership between SHADAC and several government agencies, and was known as "SNACC" based on the first initials of the participating organizations (for more information, see http://www.census.gov/did/www/snacc/ ). This analysis has not been expanded thus far to the ACS. The contractor shall work with the Census Bureau to expand this analysis to the ACS by assisting in the determination of which SNACC tables should be produced based on the ACS, consider additional analysis such as studying partial benefits, perform an analysis of the linked data, and assist with writing a final report.</p>
<p>9. Time Series Harmonization. Through the University of Minnesota's Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) website, SHADAC has produced a series of CPS datasets that are much more harmonized (consistent over time) than those available through the Census Bureau as described below in Sections 10 through 12. <br /><br />10. ACS: SHADAC has worked with the Census Bureau to develop a series of ACS coverage edits that were incorporated into the 2009 ACS. However, the 2008 ACS PUMS was released prior to the incorporation of these edits, so ACS public file users cannot take advantage of these improvements. The contractor shall apply these coverage edits to the 2008 ACS PUMS file. This revised file will be distributed through the IPUMS website. These data and estimates will provide researchers with a consistent time series for analysis because the Census Bureau will not re-release the 2008 data with the changes. Census Bureau's work with the states has found that consistent trend data are very important for policy decisions and reporting requirements. The contractor shall also produce a short working paper explaining the new coverage edits applied to the 2009 PUMS file and how data users can undo the coverage edits if pre-coverage edit data are needed for specific research.</p>
<p>11. CPS: The Census Bureau will be implementing CPS edit improvements in 2011. These improvements were based on the results of the analysis conducted by SHADAC and Census Bureau. These CPS edit changes will be incorporated into the enhanced time series developed by the contractor and disseminated through the IPUMS website.</p>
<p>12. ACS Health Insurance Unit: Develop a policy-relevant Health Insurance Unit (HIU) variable for data users and researchers to understand health insurance policy and how they affect families. A consistent and well-documented method for developing a HIU will be beneficial for public data users and will promote comparative analysis in the field of health services research. There are different methods to create a HIU and thus are proposing developing one consistent and well-documented method that will help analysts better understand the potential impact of health insurance policy changes on families and individuals.</p>
<p>Place of Performance</p>
<p>The place of performance shall be at the contractor's site. The period of performance shall consist of a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods. The government anticipates awarding a Time and Materials contract using Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures. THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE: Regents of the University of Minnesota, 200 Oak Street, SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455-2009.

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified GSA Schedule contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, understand GSA Schedule pricing and discount practices and other market information readily available.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the physician labor market.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The VHA Healthcare Retention & Recruitment Office is responsible for developing and implementing candidate sourcing and recruitment marketing strategies for The Veterans Health Administration. Physicians from many medical specializations are hard to recruit and difficult to retain. While VHA has successfully implemented a variety of initiatives including our internal national recruitment functions, physician pay changes, education loan reimbursements, relocation (for select subspecialties), and other recruitment and retention incentives, a more sustained market-driven approach is required to continue to source and recruit physicians across a spectrum of specializations. Rather than approaching the task blindly, market research is necessary to direct and shape VA recruitment and retention efforts.
Additionally, achievement of VHA workforce objectives is significantly improved by capitalizing on the recruitment and retention of Physicians including medical residents and fellows. Residents and fellows who complete portions of their medical education training in VA facilities are of particular interest. Existing research from the National Institute of Physician Recruitment & Retention indicates that medical resident and fellows represents the following:
"	Graduating residents and fellows entering practice make up only 3% of the total practicing physician population.
"	More than 50% of all recruited physicians are currently practicing physicians.
"	82% of residents look for practice opportunities in communities of 25,000 or more.
"	50% of all residents report receiving over 100 practice opportunities during their residencies.
"	63 % of these offers are made prior to their final year.
"	Dual income families have professional career needs that have implications for recruitment and relocation.


Scope of Work: 
The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the objectives and deliverables described in the performance work statement (PWS), except as may otherwise be specified.


Period of Performance:
The period of performance shall be one year from date of award.
1.0.3 OBJECTIVES
This procurement seeks to acquire a recruitment and marketing study. The project will include research into and analysis of key factors that impact the Veterans Health Administration's ability to recruit and retain both experienced physicians and residents exiting training and entering their first practice. Results will be stratified by targeted recruitment groups and defined specialty areas. Perceived perception of VHA as an employer is one of many factors under consideration. Others which may influence employment decisions include, but are not limited to:
o	Salary and benefit packages
o	Work environment and operational tempo
o	VA's reputation as a healthcare organization
o	VA's reputation as an employer
o	Factors that draw candidates to VA as an employer
o	Factors that adversely influence candidates' interest in VA
1.0.3.1 Task Objective 1: Perform market research
The study will also evaluate what communication and networking systems physicians use to explore and identify practice opportunities and the degree of reliance of these systems.
"	Analysis of national private-sector employment market conditions for Physicians, current and future projection(s)
"	Assessment of recruitment practices among private-sector competitors (retained/contingency search firms and in-house recruitment departments within major healthcare systems)
"	Qualitative & quantitative analysis of factors influencing physicians to VA employment, dissuading them from employment, and potential recruitment messaging 
"	SWOT analysis
"	Strategic Recommendations
"	Tactical Recommendations
"	Ad campaign creative collateral concepts
"	Budgetary Implications
o	Veterans Health Administration has a long-term and well-established brand, "VA - The Best Care - The Best Careers". This brand resonates strongly with health care providers. Focus groups conducted annually from 2004-2006 confirm that continued use of that brand is an appropriate and compelling recruitment tool. Strategies and creative recruitment collateral developed in support of this program will incorporate that existing branding.
o	All work must be in compliance with VA graphic standards, in consultation with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).
o	All materials developed, print or electronic, must comply with governmental and VA policy regarding accessibility and privacy and become the sole property of the Department of Veterans Affairs. All media-based activity must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
o	All native files including images, likeness, brands created under this contract for creative collateral development will be provided and owned by VHA.
Methodology: Literature review of recruitment marketing and candidate sourcing strategies for physicians and medical residents; focus group interviews with medical students, medical residents, and current VA physicians to explore factors that influence and/or discouraged selection of VA as an employer, factors that influence retention, work environment factors that impact retention positively or negatively, where and how they seek employment opportunities, when and how they gained information that led to seeking employment with VA. Assessment and analysis of the public medical community will also be included. Based on focus group, surveys, research, historical data, exit surveys and other findings the contractor will develop and administer a survey instrument to provide qualitative analysis of focus group findings or recommend an alternative course of action for qualitative or quantitative analysis that my produce reliable research data on which to base development of a wide-ranging recruitment marketing plan.
B. Tasks and Associated Deliverables: In broad strokes, the tasks are indicated below and shall be accomplished in accordance with the schedule indicated. If the Contractor believes that different dates should be established, these proposed dates will be indicated in the contractor's technical proposal and the detailed work plan. The final product will be a written report including an executive summary, findings and recommendations from the recruitment research and analysis. Two electronic copies of the reports (in an MS Word version compatible with the version in use by VA at the time the report is delivered) will be provided, one to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative and one to the Contracting Officer as well as one web-ready copy of the report that is key word indexed.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Contracting Directorate, Enterprise Contracting Division, Test Branch, Eglin AFB, FL is interested in receiving information relating to a potential Store Separation Telemetry (SST) System. This initiative, if funded, will fall under the direction of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Test Resources Management Center (TRMC), Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP). In order to meet our planning objectives, responses to this RFI are requested NLT 05 June 2011. The 46th Test Systems Squadron, Advanced Test and Training Systems Flight (46 TSSQ/RNXT) has initiated the SST effort to provide the capability to measure and transmit six degree of freedom (6-DOF) data for a variety of stores using a common, miniaturized unit. The objective of this effort is to develop a self contained unit with the following attributes: a) self-powered, b) uses existing range telemetry (TM) infrastructure, and c) integrates state of the art miniaturized components to minimize size. The goal of the SST project is to develop a capability to instrument a variety of stores so as to a) support store separation testing on aircraft that are not equipped with cameras or video, b) to support multiple drops per mission through the delivery of real-time 6-DOF data to separation engineers, and c) provide higher fidelity data that is currently not attainable with photogrammetric methods.
<p>Store 6-DOF data is currently obtained using high speed film/video recording methods or store mounted TM kits. Photogrammetric methods require that the release aircraft be configured with onboard cameras &amp; associated hardware. In addition, photogrammetric data is limited to positions and orientations and does not capture rates and accelerations, which limits store separation analysis capabilities. Current TM systems are either custom to store type or are limited to fuze well installations and are not suitable for small stores due to their size and weight.</p>
<p>Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Technical feasibility and risk assessment associated with the SST concept. <br />&bull; Conceptual and innovative design concepts that utilize next generation subminiature technology to integrate key components such as accelerometers, rate gyros, a telemetry transmitter, and encryption. <br />&bull; The technical feasibility of using interchangeable parts and components to satisfy a range of weapon weight classes and their unique requirements.<br />&bull; Potential innovative antenna designs that could support internal and/or external installations of this instrumentation on stores. <br />&bull; Potential power sources (batteries) that could be used to support installation of this instrumentation on stores of various weight classes.<br />&bull; Telemetry options (point to point, re-rad); in addition, the feasibility of using C-band for telemetry should be discussed. <br />&bull; Schedule estimates. <br />See attached addendum for more information.<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a RFP or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not plan to award a contract based on the responses from this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The information you provide may be used by the Services in developing an acquisition strategy, a Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives, and Performance Specifications. The information resulting from this RFI may be included in one or more RFPs, which will be released to industry. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. RFI responses will contribute to the Market Research Report as part of the acquisition strategy development process. Currently, the acquisition strategy has not been determined. Sources responding are invited to provide input into the acquisition strategy, recommendations concerning contract type, contract clauses, other aspects of the acquisition strategy; and anything else that would help in defining an efficient and effective acquisition, are requested. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents are advised that 46 TSSQ/RNXT is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI may be synopsized at a future date. If synopsized, information detailing the specific requirements of this procurement(s) will be included.</p>
<p>Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their acquisition recommendations/strategies as requested above no later than 05 June 2011. Small Business sources responding should state their business size status based on NAICS code 541512 (size standard $25.0) and whether they are interested as a prime or subcontractor. Please submit responses via e-mail to 46twtssr@eglin.af.mil with a subject line of Store Separation Telemetry Response or mail to: AAC/PKET, 205 West D Ave, Suite 427, Eglin AFB, 32542. Please direct contractual questions to Contract Specialist Captain Dustin Wade, (850) 882-0166, e-mail: dustin.wade@eglin.af.mil. Technical performance information or requests for technical clarification may be obtained from the SST Project Manager, Mr. Steve Musteric, (850) 883-7685 or e-mail steven.musteric@eglin.af.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>Marine Resiliency Study II

<ARCHDATE>05262011
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil">NMLC Research</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to the Veterans Medical Research Foundation of San Diego (VMRF), 3350 La Jolla Village Drive (151A), San Diego, CA 92161, for the performance of research and development (R&D), clinical studies in support of the Naval Medical Research Center.

This requirement will evaluate the physical, family, social, cognitive and mental health status of ground combat Marines deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan.  Marine Resiliency Study II (MRS-II) will provide for extended evaluation and additional follow up assessments of remaining active duty Marines in battalions previously assessed by Marine Resiliency Study I (MRS-I), a prospective, longitudinal assessment of 2,500 Marines pre- and post-deployment across psychosocial, physiological, and biological domains.
  MRS-II will assess Marines in those same battalions, or other battalions slated for deployment who have not previously enrolled in MRS-I, thus enabling use of novel pre- and post-deployment measures that will not interfere with the ongoing MRS project, but can be designed to coordinate with measures used in the United States Armys Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members (STARRS).  Additionally MRS-II will recruit Marines drawn from the original MRS cohort to study the feasibility of targeted prevention or intervention protocols, or the use of new technologies to identify biomarkers.  A specific goal of these small studies would be to determine feasibility and to estimate effect sizes for more extensive studies in larger Department of Defense (DoD) groups, such as that from Army STARRS.
  The primary aim is to identify the individual, social, and deployment factors that predict post-deployment mental health response, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and secondly, by integrating and analyzing data across psychosocial, physiological and biological domains, to accomplish a multi-system understanding of the phenomenology of adaptation to stress.   

The estimated value of this contract is $6.898 Million. The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 12-months, followed by two 12-month option periods for a total of 36-months.  MRS-II is the direct follow-on and expansion of a previous study performed, by the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS), Veterans Medical Research Foundation of San Diego (VMRF), and affiliate University of California, San Diego (UCSD), entitled MRS I.
  MRS-II includes a long-term follow-up to MRS-I that would add two additional assessments beyond the originally proposed 3-month and 6-month post-deployment assessments.  In addition, a pre-post redeployment study in MRS cohorts designed to identify additional predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) vulnerability will be performed using the members of the same battalion as previously enrolled Marines.  Lastly, a series of demonstration projects would be designed so that subgroups drawn from the original cohort could test the feasibility of specific experimental designs such as targeted prevention or treatment protocols, or the use of new technology to identify biomarkers.

Since MRS-I is already in progress at the core VASDHS facility, associated non-profit VMRF, and affiliate UCSD, the administrative structure, relationships, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals are in place for implementation of the long-term follow-up component of MRS-II, and for the enrollment of new Marines for the pre-post redeployment study, it would be financially prudent and timely to use the current performer on the study, VASDHS non-profit associate, VMRF.
  Only VASDHS, which houses the MRS administrative core, along with associate non-profit VMRF and affiliate UCSD have the data from MRS-I and the knowledge and experience to perform MRS-II.  In addition, specific psychophysiologic and biomarker methodology that is proprietary to MRS has been developed by VASDHS and affiliate UCSD researchers for MRS-I, and would be essential for the scientific validity of the longitudinal nature of the work proposed for MRS-II.

Given that execution of MRS-II requires infrastructure, relationships, and data that are available only from MRS-I, the MRS team is a unique group that can fulfill the research required (prospective assessment of risk factors predictive of PTSD and other mental health disorders after combat in active duty Marines), most efficiently in terms of feasibility, cost, subject burden, data quality, experience, and extensive United States Marine Corps (USMC) working relationships.
  Due to the extensive assessment battery, custom equipment, and expertise needed to implement these data collections it would be virtually impossible for another group to adequately replicate the procedures used in a seamless enough way to ensure data integrity for the cross time-point and cross-cohort analyses proposed in this project.  

Based on these unique capabilities and the previous work done with the Veterans Medical Research Foundation of San Diego (VMRF), VMRF is the only institution capable of meeting the Governments requirements.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data and other information sufficient to determine capability to perform the proposed contract effort.

All capability statements received by 3:30PM Eastern Time on May 26, 2011, will be considered by the Government.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Karolinska Institute, Department of Neurobiology, Retzius v. 8, B2:4, Stockholm, Sweden S-171 77.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires specialized skills, expertise, facilities and equipment to be able to do the very specific research needed.
Objectives 
The objectives of this contract is to provide the NIDA IRP with further characterization of mito Park mice as pertaining to the ongoing IRP research effort into the nature of drug abuse and addiction.  It has been determined that the original mouse animal model carries a dopamine neuron-specific deletion of the mtDNA transcription factor TFAM.  This characterization will be determined via the following procedures as performed by the contractor:
Development of transgenic mice with midbrain DA neuron mitochondria labeled with yellow   fluorescent protein (YFP)
Crosses of YFP mice and MitoPark mice
Further studies of neuropathological events in dopamine neurons of the YFP mitoPark mice
Effects of exercise in this animal model 
Specific Requirements
Generation of transgenic mice in which the mitochondria of midbrain DA neurons are specifically labeled with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Evaluation of these mice by motor behavior, immunocytochemistry and biochemistry.
   Crosses of the YFP mice with MitoPark mice to obtain YFP labeling of midbrain DA    mitochondria in TFAM deficient neurons.
Studies of neuropatholgical events in the dopamine neurons of YFP mitoPark mice at the cell body and terminal level using this genetically engineered marker to identify only the mitochondria of dopamine neurons.
Investigations into the effect of exercise on the animal model to determine if early initiation of exercise can alter the neurodegenerative events
Karolinska Institute recently successfully developed fluorescent mitochondria transgenic with expression restricted to midbrain dopamine neurons. No other laboratory in the world has all these techniques and resources in one site as well as a large mito Park colony.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2011196 may be submitted to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay by May 16, 2011.

In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>US Personal Services Contract<br />US Department of State<br />Bureau of International Narcotics &amp; Law Enforcement Affairs<br />Office of Europe and Asia INL/EA</p>
<p>I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is charged with developing strategies and programs to achieve international narcotics control and law enforcement foreign policy objectives. Washington personnel are involved in policy formulation and implementation; coordination of policies and programs with other United Stated government (USG) agencies, other governments, and with international organizations; development, implementation, oversight and evaluation of overseas programs and projects; and resource management.</p>
<p>The Director heads the Office for Europe and Asia (INL/EA), which has responsibility for managing all programmatic activity for international narcotics control and law enforcement programs in the Eurasian and Asian regions. To accomplish this, INL/EA provides programmatic analysis and management, including oversight and evaluation, for INL offices overseas in the aforementioned regions as well as coordination of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance programs by other USG agencies including the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Justice (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and others. In the delivery of these programs, the Office also oversees the work of contractors, international organizations, and international non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The purpose of this position is to serve as a Senior Program Advisor to the Director on issues relating to the direction of INL counter-narcotics (CN) and anticrime programs. The Advisor will perform duties in both domestic and foreign locations as assigned by the INL/EA Director.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities: <br />A. The Senior Program Advisor has primary responsibility for providing expert counsel and assistance in the formulation and implementation of policies and procedures for the programming of INL-funded programs in the Central Asia region. The Advisor, acting in the capacity of a Senior Program Advisor, may be assigned to any of the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Formulate policy, provide program support, and appropriate policy guidance on the international narcotics control and crime programs for Eurasia and Asia, but in particular Central Asia and countries within the region as assigned.</p>
<p>2. Participate in meetings with senior INL and Department of State (DOS) personnel involved in international narcotics control and law enforcement program issues; gather and analyze information and provide expert counsel and assistance for programs and policies related to an assigned portfolio; provide guidance and advice to senior INL/EA management regarding the formulation and implementation of counternarcotics and anticrime programs; and draft or revise policy papers, official telegrams and/or memoranda to disseminate applicable policies.</p>
<p>3. Substitute for and/or provide programmatic assistance to senior staff in an embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), as required, manage day-to-day activities, carry out special projects, and implement new programs in the capacity of Senior Program Advisor. The Advisor would typically direct the day-to-day program and management operations of a NAS; assess and evaluate INL policies, procedures, and internal controls; and make/implement recommendations to improve efficiency and overall effectiveness of programming.</p>
<p>4. Conduct (or be assigned to a team tasked with conducting) program evaluation visits at overseas NAS offices.</p>
<p>5. Keep fully abreast of significant developments, domestic and foreign, which directly or indirectly affect USG drug control and law enforcement efforts. Make recommendations to seventh floor principals for changes to program objectives to reflect new developments or goals in foreign policy.</p>
<p>6. Represent the DOS at intra- and inter-agency meetings related to programs within his/her responsibility. Participate in bilateral and multilateral international narcotics control and crime assistance programs.</p>
<p>7. Prepare regular oral and written status updates regarding strategy and initiatives in relation to Central Asia and specific countries in the region.</p>
<p>Supervision: <br />The Senior Program Advisor will receive general guidance from the INL/EA Director and from the Team Leader to whom assigned. As a recognized authority in analysis and INL program issues, the Advisor will receive administrative, management, and program policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives, after which he/she independently negotiates the scope and objectives of each tasking with little input or review by his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>The Advisor typically exercises discretion and judgment in determining whether to broaden or narrow the scope of the assigned programs, projects, or studies. Completed work is reviewed for potential influence on broad INL policy and goals, fulfillment of objectives, and contributions to advancement of best practices, and is normally accepted without significant changes.</p>
<p>Supervision Exercised: <br />The Advisor of this position does not have supervisory responsibilities. However, when tasked with substituting for senior staff in INL or at an overseas Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) on a temporary basis, the Advisor may supervise non-direct hire staff and provide leadership and direction to other local hire personnel in the organization.</p>
<p>Guidelines:<br />1. Guidelines include basic legislation, including Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act, other supplemental appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility. In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history.</p>
<p>2. The INL Financial Management Handbook, INL Program and Policy Guide, and INL Procurement Policies and Procedures provide supplementary guidance.</p>
<p>3. The Senior Program Advisor must exercise substantial judgment based on an in-depth knowledge of applicable guidelines and regulations to interpret and adapt existing precedents, in developing new or improved approaches, and in analyzing controversial and/or nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views.</p>
<p>4. The Advisor is recognized as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on a full range of programmatic issues.</p>
<p>Complexity: <br />The work involves planning, organizing, and completing projects and managing day-to-day programs. Because of the complexity, high visibility, and/or political sensitivity related to many issues with which the Bureau is involved, the Advisor may encounter difficulty in identifying the exact nature of the relevant issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of tasks, studies and/or audits to be undertaken. The Advisor may also encounter difficulty in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the best course of action and/or discerning the intent of legislation, policy statements, or bilateral agreements and determining how to best translate the intent into program actions. The work may require the Advisor to establish new concepts, theories, or programs and considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems.</p>
<p>Scope and Effectiveness: <br />The Program Advisor performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program that spans a full range of counternarcotics, anticrime, criminal justice and civilian police programs throughout the Eurasia and Asian regions. INL programs have a significant impact on the domestic and overseas operations of the DOS, as well as on other USG agencies and international organizations. The Advisor may be required to travel to and work in hazardous duties.</p>
<p>Personal Contacts: <br />The Advisor works closely with Senior INL personal, as well as with personnel in other bureaus of the DOS, USG agencies, and overseas posts and international organizations.</p>
<p>Purpose of Contacts: <br />The Senior Program Advisor may represent INL/EA, and occasionally INL, in high-level meetings in the DOS, at overseas posts, and with other agencies, on a full range of issues relating to international narcotics, crime control programs, and management issues. The purpose of these meetings may be to justify, defend, negotiate, or settle matters involving significant or controversial issues, often in situations where the people involved have diverse viewpoints, goals, or objectives requiring the Advisor to achieve a common understanding of the problem and a satisfactory solution by convincing them, arriving at a compromise, or developing suitable alternatives.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements: <br />1. Must be a US citizen and able to obtain/maintain a Department of State DOS Top Secret/SCI security clearance.</p>
<p>2. Education: A Masters degree from an accredited institution is required.</p>
<p>3. Prior Work Experience: Must have a minimum of fifteen years of work experience with the DOS: twelve years working at overseas posts and three years working in Washington, DC at a senior level.</p>
<p>4. Specialized Experience: Must have at least five years of work experience in the Central Asia region and at least three years of work experience with international organizations dealing with narcotics and crime control matters, at a senior level in that region.</p>
<p>5. Knowledge: Must have a thorough understanding of the DOS and U.S. embassy organization and operations including the functions of the Narcotics Affairs Sections. Must also have a broad understanding of counter-narcotics and anti-crime programs managed by international organizations, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the European Commission and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as they related to the Central Asia region. Must have experience working with INL counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs. Must have a working knowledge of the Russian language.</p>
<p>6. Availability: Must be able to travel to overseas posts and to remote locations in foreign areas.</p>
<p>7. Skills: Proficient in Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p>Location: <br />This position is located in the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office for Europe and Asia, located in SA-4 (Navy Hill, South Building), 2430 E Street NW, and Washington, DC 20037.</p>
<p>Work Environment: <br />For the most part, the work is performed in an office environment at the DOS in Washington, D.C. and at overseas posts. The work is sedentary in nature with occasional light or moderate physical effort required.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />Factor 1: Demonstrated senior-level Foreign Service, other U.S. Government or international organization experience working in the Central Asian region overseas in programmatic positions. (20 points)</p>
<p>Factor 2: Demonstrated experience working at the DOS in a policy and/or program capacity in a regional or functional bureau. (20 points)</p>
<p>Factor 3: Demonstrated experience developing and analyzing counter-narcotics and anti-crime programs in the Eurasia and Asian regions. (20 points)</p>

<p>Factor 6: Offeror's previous experience and quality of past performance. (Evaluator may use all evaluation information available at the time of the evaluation, whether provided by the applicant or obtained from references.). (10 points)</p>

Entry-level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position. However, consideration will be given to the successful applicant's experience that is specifically relevant to the position to be filled.

(a) To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to Pub.

(b) No separate justification or determination and findings are required under this part to set-aside a contract action. The set-aside shall be based on a specific geographic area, within a Presidential declaration(s) of disaster or emergency. 6.603 Use of procedures other than set-aside. When implementing the Stafford Act preference by using procedures other than a set-aside under section 6.602, the requirements for a justification to support the use of this authority are in 6.303. These procurements qualify as other than full and open competition.<BR><BR>

<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation; NAICS code 541380, Testing Laboratories identified as RFQ #1081895, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106; for the following scope of work (SOW), under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is an unrestricted requirement. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.</p>
<p>A. Objective</p>
<p>The office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD) at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates diagnostic devices for Influenza. Rapid diagnosis of influenza is critical for appropriate patient management in the setting of acute respiratory illness. Rapid molecular diagnostic methods for the detection of influenza are more sensitive and robust than conventional virus isolation methods and are increasingly replacing these conventional methods in the diagnosis of influenza in clinical practice. This poses a regulatory challenge to FDA since currently the determination of sensitivity and specificity of an investigational influenza devices are based on the comparison of the manufacturer's new device to virus culture. This study will determine if it is possible to use alternative molecular diagnostic methods as more rapid and accurate reference methods for the premarket evaluation of influenza devices. It will provide information that could support a paradigm shift on the Agency's review of these devices. Understanding the association between infectious virus and the presence of nucleic acid is essential both for FDA review of newer diagnostic technologies and for properly describing how nucleic acid tests should be used in clinical practice. This project addresses the public health needs as it seeks to expedite and improve the regulatory mission of OIVD through accelerating the availability of safe and effective rapid influenza diagnostic devices. Rapid influenza diagnostic devices are of critical importance, since novel strains of influenza virus have quickly emerged and spread (e.g., recent 2009 H1N1 has).</p>
<p>B. Scope of Work</p>
<p>At this time we are seeking the use of contractors to perform a prospective longitudinal clinical study, collecting respiratory samples e.g., nasal swab samples, from patients clinically diagnosed with influenza during the Influenza season. The basis for confirmation of influenza infection should follow the current standard of care practices including the clinical presentation. Any laboratory tests or testing algorithms used as an aid in the confirmation of active infection should be clearly described as part of the clinical protocol prior to the initiation of the study. It is required that the diagnostic tests used to confirm diagnosis are FDA cleared assays. The contractor shall obtain their own IRB approval for the study and provide us with the clinical specimens de linked and de identified. The date of sample collection, demographic information, clinical symptoms, and days from the onset of symptoms are required.</p>
<p>The nature of the required study is such that samples will be collected initially at the onset of infection and follow up samples will be collected at subsequent time points for up to two weeks after the initial infection. The contractor should have the ability to follow up with the patients for up to 30 days after infection. The target number of patients to be included in the study is 60 patients, immunocompetent individuals (not transplant patients), and we do not have an age restriction. We expect to evaluate the different strains of influenza circulating in the season. However, we plan to stratify the results by age groups and patients infected by the 2009 H1N1 and other seasonal influenza strains. The contract should include a detailed description of the parameters the contractor will use to determine the acute phase of the infection. The contractor should be able to collect the initial nasal samples within three days of symptom onset. Patients have to be followed up obtaining longitudinal samples daily for the first three days post infection and then biweekly for the first two weeks. The proposal should propose a detailed sample collection plan, indicating the time points the contractor is able to include and the appropriate justifications or limitations as applicable. Samples should be shipped fresh to the FDA to perform virus isolation by cell culture and RT-PCR analysis and the proposal should provide a description of the sample shipping plan. We recommend that sample collection and shipment protocols follow standardized guidelines. The contractor should be an entity with recognized academic expertise in the field of Influenza diagnostics and molecular epidemiological studies. It is recommended that the contractor has prior experience in performing viral shedding studies. Prior to the initiation of the clinical study the contractor is required to share knowledge and expertise as well as provide proficiency panels, virus strains or well characterized samples for the validation of FDA's virus culture and RT-PCR methods and the contractor shall be available to communicate and share expertise and discuss the progress and findings of the study. The proposal should indicate the expected deliverables, required budget, payment schedules, and timelines as well as the periodic reporting and communication scheme with the FDA.</p>
<p>C. Tasks:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Perform a longitudinal viral shedding collection study during the influenza season, enrolling patients and collecting nasal samples from patients diagnosed with influenza at the onset of symptoms and subsequently for the first two weeks after infection.</p>
<p>2. Provide proficiency panels or material for the validation of virus isolation and PCR tests used at the FDA.</p>
<p>3. Interact, communicate, and share knowledge and expertise as needed throughout the study period.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br /><br />&bull; Provide the FDA with a detailed study plan <br />&bull; Execute the clinical study; deliver specimens and the required clinical and demographic information to the FDA. <br />&bull; Provide materials and share resources and expertise in developing and validating the diagnostic tests at the FDA. <br />&bull; Share expertise in the data analysis and reporting of results.</p>
<p>Assignments and deliverables are at the discretion of the Principal Investigator of the project at OIVD. The principal investigator will coordinate with the Project Officer, serving as the technical representative responsible for validating the quantity and quality of services received, as well as certifying receipt of required deliverables.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The contract performance period shall not exceed two years.</p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The offerors shall show thorough understanding of the objectives stated in the Scope of Work and offer a logical program for its achievement. All submitted proposals shall not exceed 10 pages. All Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria.</p>
<p>1. The ability to demonstrate a high level of technical expertise and record of recent successful experience in performing longitudinal Influenza virus shedding in clinical studies in immunocompetent individuals along with having the appropriate infrastructure for storage and shipping samples in place.</p>
<p>2. The ability to demonstrate excellent research expertise and scientific records in the application of and evaluation of FDA cleared in- vitro diagnostic methods for Influenza; including molecular diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrated experience in record keeping and ability to communicate feasibly via phone, fax, e-mail, and in person. Technical expertise required in maintaining and working with electronic records.</p>
<p>The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as quotations become more equal based on the other factors.</p>

Stacked configuration anticipates four MMS Spacecrafts as	 shown on the picturebelow. Correct? CORRECT2. Are MMS vehicles' replicas in a stack suppose to be attached to each otherpermanently? YES3. As per our understanding no portion of XERF fairing compartment and/or ATLAS Vlaunching vehicle is required to be represented on this model. Correct?  30 modelswithout fairing4. Do you require any type of stand, display or mount for each stack of MMS vehicles'replicas. Obviously some type of base (wood, etc.)5. Do you require a storage/carrying/transit case to accompany the models? For samples ofour transit cases please, visit http://www.lifeinscale.com/mm_products.asp#transit     NO6. Is there only one satellite design for the 30 copies or are there 30 differentsatellites to be built, each unique in design and features? One satellite, 30 copies		 Half Shroud Model1. "models with a one-half fairing configuration" Does it anticipate a stack identical tothe one above mounted inside a replica of the XEPF fairing with longitudinalcross-section allowing to see the stacked replicas of MMS Spacecraft? Please, confirm.CORRECT2. A scale of this model should be 1/25 as well. Correct? 1/25 to 1/27 approximately3. Do you require any type of stand, display or mount for each model? Please, specify therequirements. SAME AS ABOVE4. Do you require a storage/carrying/transit case for the models? Also, do you requireclear protective covers (Plexiglas or acrylic)? NO5. Are the stacked satellites to fit into an existing model of an ATLAS V or are they tofit into the Half Shroud Models? Half Shroud for two models only.6. Are the Half Shroud Models cut-always of the upper part of an ATLAS V? Yes7. Once the contract is awarded will there be access to more accurate plans availableother than the PowerPoint file? These are the only files available at this time...8. Do the two half shrouds need to connect together? Will people be placing the satellitemodels inside the and closing the shroud?  We have only requested one half of the fairingwith the spacecraft inside (cross section).It will not be a complete fairing.9. Do you require interior detail of the shrouds or are they to have a smooth interior?The fairing should include details....This can be found in the Atlas V users guide thatwas provided.10. The half shrouds should end where at Centaur Forward Adapter or do you want a lengthof the Common Centaur as well? At the adapter...no centaur.11. Are the satellites to be painting with all the colors shown in the PowerPointPresentation or is there a more accurate photo of what the satellites typically looklike.

<p>The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-107-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51, May 2, 2011.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The proposed period of performance for this service will consist on one (12) month basic contract period, four (4) options to renew for a twelve month period each.</p>
<p>This requirement will be set-aside for those&nbsp;quotations in the Washington D.C./Maryland/Virginia Metropolitan area.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 622110 and the business size standard is $34.5M. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p><strong>The Contractor must adhere to NIH Information and Physical Access Security Requirements Security Information. (See Article "H" for Requirements.)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Work<br /></span></strong><br /><strong>Background: <br /></strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. Investigators in the Division of Intramural Research for the National Human Genome Research Institute at NIH manage diverse IRB-approved human clinical protocols for a variety of rare genetic disorders that involve DNA-based molecular research analysis. As required by the IRB, any result(s) of a DNA-based molecular research study that originates from the research laboratory must be validated on human samples handled for genomic DNA extraction in a CLIA-approved (licensed) laboratory to be reportable to the patient. Inbound/outbound transportation with future &amp; timely access to high quality genomic DNA for an estimated 200 samples per year is required. More can be added based on the customer need and the reagents/kits available for DNA extraction, that optimize quality, management, tracking and long-term storage as requested by NHGRI.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>NHGRI/NIH investigators require future and timely access to high quality genomic DNA extracted under CLIA-approved licensed laboratory conditions that includes the capacity for long-term storage. DNA extraction from whole blood EDTA and/or buccal cell samples must be performed by standard laboratory methods/kit that optimize purity and total yield to produce high-quality genomic DNA for an estimated 200 human samples per year. The final DNA product must be prepared for long-term storage in a cryotube to withstand storage at minus 80-degree centigrade freezer conditions for minimum one or more years until requested/required by NIH/NHGRI investigator(s) for future diagnostic/validation assay(s).</p>
<p><strong>REQUIRED ELEMENTS:<br /></strong><br />&bull; CLIA licensed laboratory setting (valid license)-MANDATORY CRITERIA<br />&bull; State-of-the- art laboratory facility located within the Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia Metropolitan area to provide specimen handling (human samples), processing and repository management for NIH/NHGRI investigators.<br />&bull; The laboratory will produce high-quality genomic DNA under valid CLIA-approved license as part of this contract. <br />&bull; Timely access to inventory of NIH/NHGRI sample(s) that can be "pulled" upon request for transport back to primary investigator/NHGRI<br />&bull; Capacity for long-term frozen storage maintenance for at least 1 year but capable of extending this to 5 or more years, depending on NHGRI/NIH requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The Contracted laboratory shall provide for the following:</p>
<p>1. Inbound/outbound transportation to laboratory (located in the Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia Metropolitan area) from NIH and/or offsite setting where sample received. Samples may be drawn at NIH-CC or obtained and shipped from offsite setting (coordinated by investigator) and transported to laboratory for DNA extraction. Upon request of NIH/NHGRI investigator, stored DNA sample(s) may be pulled for transport back to primary investigator at NHGRI/NIH and/or shipped directly to a designated testing laboratory.</p>
<p>2. DNA extraction: Methodology used should apply standard laboratory procedures required in a CLIA-approved setting that optimize and meet NIH/NHGRI requirements for high quality DNA extraction and long-term frozen storage. The respondent must receive whole blood in EDTA vacutainers or equivalent and/or buccal cell specimens and prepare them for DNA extraction. All reagents/DNA extraction kits, storage tubes used must optimize for purity, total yield and long-term storage. From one mL of whole blood with a normal white cell count (range of 5-10 million WBC/mL blood), the expected yield range is 15-50 ug DNA. A standard DNA extraction kit (e.g., Gentra Puregene DNA Extraction Kit) can be used for DNA extraction from whole blood EDTA and/or buccal cheek swab samples. Hydrated DNA should be assayed for purity and yield (ug) by spectrophotometry, with report available for investigator/NHGRI. The final DNA product should be prepared for long-term storage in a cryotube to withstand long-term storage in a -80 degree centigrade freezer. For 10-mL EDTA tube with normal WBC, the expected total DNA yield is approximately 150-500 ug of DNA with purity range expected 1.6-2.0.</p>
<p>3. Adherence to best practices that follow NIH Guidelines for Human Biospecimen Storage and Tracking within the NIH Intramural Research Program (Approve by NIH Steering Committee July 2008) is required. <strong>(SEE ATTACHED REQUIRED GUIDELINES).</strong></p>
<p>4. A sample tracking mechanism for NIH/NHGRI samples should incorporate NHGRI/NIH sample accession number and/or patient information as specified per protocol (protocol #, subject study ID, NIH medical record number, sample date) and outcome variables of DNA extraction (sample type, sample date, DNA concentration/total yield, freeze/thaw #), etc. as required by NHGRI/NIH investigator.</p>
<p><strong><em>5. Adherence to NIH Information and Physical Access Security Requirements. (See Article " H")</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Government Responsibilities</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Package/ship human samples in compliance with human biological specimens and paperwork used for standard sample request.</p>

<p>&bull; Access to Inventory list of processed/stored samples with a report of sample date/type, DNA concentration, volume and total yield (ug) should be made available to NHGRI/NIH.</p>
<p>&bull; For each sample, minimum 1 Cryotube of DNA stored long-term (-80 degree centigrade) until requested for return.</p>
<p>&bull; Upon request of the NHGRI/NIH Principal Investigator or his/her designee, DNA aliquots should be returned to NIH with appropriate documentation (protocol #, sample name, accession number, sample date/type, DNA concentration, volume and total yield (ug), freeze/thaw #).</p>
<p><strong>Program Management and Control Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Management of human samples must be in compliance with CLIA and adhere to NIH Information and Physical Access Security requirements <strong><em>(Article H) regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII). </em></strong></p>

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers, and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
  Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy Installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at the vendors own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis.  The costs incurred to obtain Navy Installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.
  Further information regarding NCACS can be found under Popular Links at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm

<p>1.2 Background. The U.S. Coast Guard Telecommunication Information System Command (TISCOM) is responsible for configuration management of the 00069-URG-III(V) system and the RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter is a vital part of that system. The original installations of the 00069-URG-III(V), High Frequency Communication system installed a total of 40 RT-2200 Receiver/Exciters; (Part Number 822-0906-002) at all of the Communication Area Master Stations (CAMS), Communication Stations (COMMSTA) and the Engineering Logistic Center, Baltimore MD. Currently TISCOM is installing RT-2200 Receiver/Exciters with part number 822-0906-003 in the field. The differences between the two versions of the RT-2200 are significant enough to warrant an upgrade to the remaining RT-2200 units with part number 822-0906-002. Upgrading the original RT-2200s, (part no. 822-0906-002) will standardize all 00069-URG-III(V) configurations being deployed in the Coast Guard today.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be providing the personnel and equipment to service and upgrade the 11 RT-2200 Receiver/Exciters, Part Number 822-0906-002 to 822-0906-003, including shipping to Coast Guard Units requiring RT-2200 upgrades.</p>

<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), and, Command, Control, and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: The USCG began a HF Hi-Power Re-capitalization effort which requires a version Upgrade to the RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter.

The DSP card for the 822-0906-003 receiver/exciter is not compatible with the 822-0906-002 version. The DSP card for the 822-0906-003 is the only version of the card that Rockwell/Collins currently produces.</p>

In order to accomplish the required upgrades, a Firm Fixed Price type contract will be placed with the sole supplier of the RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter. The period of performance will begin from date of award through no more than 12 months thereafter. <br />The required upgrade will allow the USCG to complete the transition from currently outdated versions of the RT-2200 to the newest version. <br />The Base Requirement is for 11each RT-2200 Units to be Upgraded, with the Option for up to an additional 6 each RT-2200 Units to be Upgraded. Estimated Cost per Unit to be Upgraded is: $4,500.00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open <br />Competition: The statutory authority permitting for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 titled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p><br />5. Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited: The use of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements", is supported based upon the following:</p>
<p>Rockwell/Collins is the sole supplier and proprietor of the RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter, which includes the detailed drawings, schematics and working knowledge of current configuration and technical requirements to accomplish the version upgrade. Rockwell/Collins has Proprietary Data for the RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter that no other known Contractor has.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: A RFQ shall be posted on FED-BIZ-OPS, this RFQ will include the Statement that any Qualified Offeror that feels that they can provide the Service as Required may provide a response to the RFQ as posted and all Responses/Offers will be considered by the USCG/Government.</p>
<p><br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: As compared to previous Service Contracts for the Upgrade of these RT-2200 Units.</p>
<p><br />8. Description of Market Research: Due to this System is to be in place for another 10 Years, Market Research was not conducted at this time.</p>
<p><br />9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: The RT-2200 Receiver/Exciter is part of the 00069-URG-III(V), High Frequency Communications system currently deployed at the Coast Guard Communication Area Master Stations (CAMS) and nine Coast Guard Communication Stations (COMMSTAS). The version upgrade does not simply involve changing the two DSP card assemblies. It requires additional changes to the Audio I/O assembly and the firmware, after which each upgraded 822-0906-003 Receiver/Exciter must be re-tested, re-certified and re-nameplated. The upgrade ensures all RT-2200 versions are identical, current and compatible with all deployed 00069-URG-III(V) systems in accordance with good configuration management practices.</p>
<p>10. A Listing of the Sources, if Any That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None at this time.</p>
<p><br />11. A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: The existing system has been in service over 6 years. The upgraded system will last approximately 10 more years. Requirements to recapitalize the system at this point will be completed in accordance with FAR Part 6- Competition Requirements, Subpart 6.1 Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br />Contracting Officer Date <br />JAMES A. LASSITER 05/04/2011</p>
<p>Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification: I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The IHT must also be an accredited EPA/State Supervisor and Building Inspector. He She must have performed duties of principal assistant to a Professional IH in at least five (5) asbestos abatement projects.  
The VPIH will oversee the project to assure quality, resolve problems, prevent the spread of contamination beyond the regulated area and assure clearance at the end of the project. He/She will perform the final inspection and testing to determine whether the regulated area or building has been adequately decontaminated. All air monitoring are to be done utilizing Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM)/Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
A.	 The VPIH will perform the following tasks:

1.	Establish background levels before abatement begins by collecting 
background samples.  Samples must be retained for possible TEM analysis.

	      2. Inspect the regulated area prior to the commencement of abatement operations to ensure that abatement specifications requirements such as the following are met: enclosure integrity, location of personnel and equipment decontamination facilities, location of negative pressure machine(s), HEPA filtration, continuous pressure differential of -0.02 in wg, etc. 

                  3.    Perform continuous air monitoring, inspection and testing outside the regulated area during actual abatement work to detect any faults in the regulated area isolation and any adverse impact of surroundings from regulated area activities.  Air samples must be analyzed on-site and results must be provided to the VA Representative the same day or at the beginning of the next working day (if abatement is conducted after working hours).
    
4.	Perform unannounced visits to spot check overall compliance of work with 
contract/specifications. These visits may include any inspection, monitoring and testing inside and outside the regulated area and all aspects of the operation except personnel monitoring.

Final clearance air samples will be collected and analyzed in accordance with procedures outlined by AHERA. If work is less than 260 linear feet (lf)/160 square feet (sf), five (5) PCM samples may be collected for clearance. If work is equal to or more than 260 lf/160 sf, TEM sampling shall be done for clearance.

7.	Issue a certificate of decontamination for each regulated area. 

B.	The monitoring and inspection results of the VPIH will  be used by VACHS to
Issue any stop removal orders to the Contractor during abatement work and to accept or reject a regulated area or building as decontaminated.

C.	The VPIH will make available to VACHS IH and Project Manager the plan 
for samples collection and analysis for the continuous monitoring outside and inside the regulated area and the plan for the final inspection and testing for each space prior to executing each plan.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers IAW FAR 13.106-2-Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br /><br /><strong>Price-<br /></strong>(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best price, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Realism-Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offer does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the proposal scope of effort and the requirements of solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offerors. Also, a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technical-<br /></strong>The proposal will be determined technically acceptable if quote is composed of the items listed in the SOW. If an equal is being proposed, please provide the specifications for any items that are substituted. Clearly indicated the substitutions.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance-<br /></strong>Submit at least two (2) contracts performed in the last three to five years, comparable in value and requirements. Include name of company/agency, contract number, point of contact (name and phone number), and total dollar value.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p><br />The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>-Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> - Some doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong> - No significant performance record is identifiable.</p>
<p>Past performance is equal to price. Offer must be found technically acceptable.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>***********<br /><br />Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Amendment #1<br />RFQ11--411045<br />***********</p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the question received prior to the cutoff date listed in the notice.</p>
<p>QUESTION AND ANSWER</p>
<p><br />Q1) Storage Space - How much audio and video in-car storage space is required? How many hours or Gigabyte space would you like to retain in the vehicle?</p>
<p>A1) The RFQ called for a removable hard drive with a minimum of 40 GB and an internal hard drive with a minimum of 32 GB.</p>
<p>Q2) Cameras - How wide of an angle would you like on the front camera? We have the capability of using four cameras, how many would you need? I.e. in car, back seat camera, rear facing camera, license plate recognition cameras.</p>
<p>A2) The RFQ calls for a wide angle front and rear facing camera - 2 cameras per vehicle; one front facing and the other rear facing.</p>
<p>Q3) Communication or Connectivity Method: Our question revolves around the transfer of data from the car to a central storage location. The vehicle is not stationary, so being mobile, the data needs to be transferred via a wireless connection. What type of connectivity will be required? Our solution can be modified to provide wireless connectivity from the vehicle to the headquarters over multiple technologies: WiMAX/4G/3G/etc. Which one, or ones, are currently being used as well as projected to be used in the future?</p>
<p>A3) Data will not be transferred via a wireless connection between the vehicle and headquarters; rather, a removable hard drive is required for this system. The only wireless requirement is the transmitter/receiver, i.e. microphone.</p>
<p>Q4) Security of Data: Typically the data (video and audio) collected by the in-car camera system is needed to produce a conviction in a court of law. To provide the prosecutor as much evidence as possible, our solution collects, transfers and stores the data in a secured environment. We can provide 256 Hash encryption from camera to storage, creating a truly secure chain of custody. . Is there a FIPS level requirement for this solution? Where is the focus of security? (I.e. - storage, transmission from car to storage)</p>
<p>A4) Hash encryption is not a requirement for this RFQ.</p>
<p>Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>**THIS WILL BE A LOCALLY-AWARDED CONTRACT (NON-FEDERAL)**<br /><br />AWARD WILL BE MADE BY THE TYGARTS VALLEY CONSERVATION DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>THIS PROJECT IS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH FEDERAL USDA/NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE FUNDS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Shavers Fork Mitigation Project is a natural stream habitat-improvement project extending along 4.5 miles of the Upper Shavers Fork trout stream. The improvements will provide connectivity, habitat structure, and thermal refuge for fish using major tributaries for spawning habitat. Fish habitat improvements include narrowing the channel in select areas, enhancing the low flow channel (thalweg), adding rock and wood features to the stream, and enhancing pools.</p>
<p>The project site is located high in the mountains of Randolph and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia surrounded by the Monongahela National Forest. The Upper Shavers Fork Watershed is 60.2 square miles within one of the highest rainfall regions in the state receiving 60 inches of precipitation annually. The elevation ranges from 3500 to 3800 feet above sea level, which provides ideal growing conditions for the native Red Spruce trees. Strict adherence to pollution control measures is required.</p>
<p>The uppermost project site, at the confluence of Rocky Run, is 13 railroad miles from the primary staging location at Cheat Bridge. Transportation of all materials, equipment, and personnel to the project site must be via the railroad owned by the West Virginia State Rail Authority. The Tygarts Valley Conservation District has secured permission to use the railroad exclusively for this project for the portion of railroad track required to complete the work. There are no roads to the construction site, but the primary staging area is easily accessible from Highway 250. The primary staging area for the project is located 12.5 miles east of Huttonsville on Route 250. The primary staging area has been used for other railroad repair projects, but requires some improvements. The successful contractor must meet all requirements for operating on the state-owned railroad. Additionally, the contractor must provide all of the special equipment required to complete the project.</p>
<p>The construction season is from April 1 to November 30. Winter shutdown is from December 1 to March 31. Construction is expected to take three full construction seasons, but it is permissible and desirable to finish the project in less time.</p>
<p>The project includes various fish habitat improvements covering 4.5 miles of remote trout stream with the following major work items: clearing and grubbing; pollution control; seeding and mulching; mobilization; deepening/enhancement of 33 pools and 4,227 linear feet of thalweg (low flow) channel; earthfill for streambank shaping; 530 tons of rock riprap; quality control; 2,320 square yards of geotextile fabric; planting 1,100 red spruce seedlings and 722 other trees and shrubs; 21,190 live stakes and branch cuttings used for streambank restoration; 1,070 tons of crushed aggregate; 10,050 tons of rock for 14 boulder j-hook vanes, 2 boulder cross vanes, and 45 single wing rock deflectors; placement of 66 boulders for in-stream fish habitat; 65 large woody debris structures; 2,250 square yards of streambank restoration using reinforced earth, toe wood, and brush mattresses; 500 feet of silt fence; 3,560 feet of wattles for sediment barriers; 15,750 square feet of timber mat surfacing, and 3,476 square yards of erosion control blanket.<br />&emsp;<br /><strong>SOLICITATION INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Tygarts Valley Conservation District located in Philippi, West Virginia will issue a Contract resulting from this solicitation. This is a Local Government project; however, it is partially funded with federal funding from the USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Service. The federal funding is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Due to the use of ARRA funding, this solicitation includes some special contract requirements.</p>
<p>All on-site personnel from the successful bidder shall attend a safety class taught by the Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad, which will be arranged by the Tygarts Valley Conservation District. The class will cover unique safety requirements to the WV Central Railroad where the project is located.</p>
<p>The estimated cost range for the project is between $1 million and $4 million.</p>
<p><strong>A MANDATORY Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will be held at 8:00am (local time) on Thursday, April 21, 2011 at the Huttonsville Public Service District building located in Mill Creek, West Virginia.</strong> Huttonsville PSD is located on Route 219/92/55 across from the Helvetia-Adolph Road also known as County Route 46. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Failure to attend both the Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will result in rejection of your bid</span>. Representatives for Tygarts Valley Conservation District and Engineering will be present to discuss the Project. Participants are encouraged to pack a lunch and wear appropriate clothing for the site visit. Plan for a long day with an estimated return time of 6:00pm. Rail transportation will be provided by Tygarts Valley Conservation District.</p>
<p><strong>Bids shall be due Wednesday, JUNE 1, 2011 by 1:00pm (local</strong> <strong>time).</strong> Bids should be mailed or hand-delivered to the Tygarts Valley Conservation District Building located at Route 4, Box 501, Philippi, West Virginia. <strong>Bids will not be opened publicly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Bidders will be required to submit &nbsp;qualifications with their bid (See Instructions to Bidders Section- Article 3 of the solicitation).&nbsp; Tygarts Valley Conservation District will make&nbsp;award to the Contractor who meets all of the qualification requirements stated in Article 3 of the Instruction to Bidders&nbsp;and who has the lowest total bid price.</strong></p>
<p>Only mailed and hand-delivered bids will be accepted; faxed bids will NOT be accepted. Bids must be received on or before 1:00pm to be considered. Any bid received after that time will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>For questions relating to this project, emails are preferred and should be sent to: <a href="mailto:shall@wvca.us">shall@wvca.us</a></p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 TO THE PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR WC133F-11-RP-0026<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to change this acquisition to full and open competition. This acquisition is not set-aside for small business concerns.<br /><br /><br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services and related products to continue the development of a systematic process for the estimation of shrimp fishing effort in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA intends to establish a system of automated processes to improve the estimation of total shrimp fishing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the fourth part of an ongoing project to develop and establish a permanent shrimp fishing effort data acquisition program to be managed by NOAA Fisheries Service in cooperation with the commercial shrimp industry. The electronic logbook (ELB) methodology and technology was originally developed as prototypes by LGL Ecological Research Associates, Inc., (LGL), of Bryan, Texas, while a subcontractor to the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Foundation, Inc., (Foundation), under a series of financial assistance awards from NOAA Fisheries Service. The first contract included development, production, and placement of the first 50 ELB units and associated memory modules; development of presentation materials, and preparation for and facilitation of port meetings with interested parties. The second contract covered the purchasing of 200 ELB unit materials and associated memory modules; production of the remaining 100 ELB units and associated memory modules; assembly and placement of 100 of those units on vessels identified through scientific random selection processes; purchasing in the last four months of Phase II the raw materials of the last 100 ELB units to be assembled and placed on vessels in the first year of Phase III; collection of data from the first 50 ELB units and from the next 100 ELB units after they are placed; comparison of the ELB data with port agent records for the corresponding vessels, periods, and locations; facilitation of additional port meetings; development and refinement of the data base and algorithms for data comparisons; and reporting and recommendations to the Government, the shrimping community, and other interested parties on the findings of the data collection and analysis processes. Phase III covered the assembly and placement of 100 ELB units on vessels, production of 200 additional ELB units and associated memory modules bringing the total of units to 450. Also, Phase III covered the performance of analyses and reports on a quarterly and annual basis through the period of performance. The contractor will provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, supplies, and other direct items of expense necessary to perform the required services. The period of performance will begin October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, with 4, 12-month option years. Services include, but are not limited to: the purchase and assembly of parts and components to replace any ELB units on vessels identified through the established scientific random selection process for selecting vessels. This process will be provided to the contractor at the time of a contract award; using the replacement ELB units (furnished government equipment) to serve as a pool of replacement units to assure that once the original placements have been made, there will be no less than 400 placed and continuously operating ELB units at all times in offshore waters during the course of the contract period; purchasing and assembling the parts and components to add 100 units in inshore vessels in Louisiana; downloading and analyzing shrimp fishing effort data from all existing ELB units in operation throughout the course of the contract period; refining and improving the existing analytical software and algorithms to enhance effort estimates; providing quarterly progress reports and a final year end summary report of progress; developing operational manuals for estimating shrimp fishing effort from the combined resources of the ELB records and the landings data. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about May 27, 2011. All&nbsp;businesses interested in receiving a copy of the RFP must submit a request in writing to Jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," to 10 CFR Part 50, General Design Criterion (GDC) 2, "Design Bases for Protection Against Natural Phenomena," requires, in part, that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety must be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. This includes not only the effects of shaking, but also possible shear or volumetric deformations in the underlying geologic foundation materials. Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites," provides guidance on seismic assessments, but currently provides minimal guidance on how to conduct deformation assessments. <br /><br />Traditionally, site performance has been assessed using the assumption (either implied or explicitly) of one-dimensional (1D) propagation of waves, at both an element level and a site-scale level. These 1D analyses often include assessments of both seismic shaking and of seismic deformations. However, over the past decade or more, there has been a significant increase in the awareness that this may not always be appropriate (and is possibly un-conservative) in some cases. <br /><br />On an element level, there is a fundamental understanding that soils are sheared in three dimensions during earthquakes, although very limited research has been performed to assess the related multi-dimensional effects. This is true in part because specialized equipment (i.e. multi-directional simple shear) is required and the large majority of testing is performed using the more common 1D or 2D equipment. There are currently very limited datasets of bi&not;directional simple shear laboratory testing to elucidate the effects of multi-dimensional loading. However, the limited research that has been performed on dense sands to date indicates that current modeling tools, which are based on early unidirectional testing, will under-predict deformations in sandy materials in some cases. Understanding the true potential deformations in dense sandy materials under multi-directional loading is essential for undertaking reliable performance-based assessments of nuclear installations. Dense sands and sand mixtures are the most common soil types found at proposed non-rock nuclear sites. Because some multi-dimensional element level simple shear laboratory testing results have served to highlight the critical importance of developing a better understanding of multi&not;dimensional loading in deformation-focused performance-based engineering, the NRC is initiating a coordinated research effort to address several inter-related issues related to multidirectional loading of nuclear sites. This request for proposal is part of that effort. Using tools, such as high-end soil-structure-interaction methods, the impact of 2D and 3D seismic loading on a nuclear power plant and its site, including the effects of soil deformation on the structural foundation and piping, can be analyzed. However, undertaking these analyses requires 3D material constitutive models. Unfortunately, as a result of the general lack of multidirectional laboratory data available, there has been limited development and validation of soil constitutive models focused on 3D loading. This project addresses this need by undertaking both the testing and modeling tasks needed to further develop existing constitutive dense sand models. <br /><br />The NRC is currently also undertaking a separate program to develop a new open-source Soil&not;Structure-Interaction (SSI) modeling tool based on the OpenSEES platform for the purpose of undertaking collaborative and in-house research on performance-based design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). New multi-dimensional dense sand models are needed for this upcoming SSI research. Models developed in the project described here must be compatible with this OpenSEES-based platform. <br /><br />In addition, there is now an understanding that the element-level behavior of sands under multi&not;directional loading (in terms of modulus degradation and damping curves) is sometimes very different than under 1D loading and is a function of ground motion rotation in addition to loading. Currently the NRC has a separate cooperative program with the Bureau of Reclamation underway to develop new multi-dimensional site response tools focused on the impacts of multi&not;directional loading on shaking. Efforts will be made by NRC staff to bring synergy between these projects to the degree possible. <br /><br />The objective of this contract is to investigate an area of seismic performance in which recent work has shown that current tools and methods may be un-conservative. This work will improve understanding of the behavior of dense sands and sandy material under multi-dimensional loading through appropriate laboratory investigations. This work will then develop one or more multi-dimensional dense sand constitutive models to be used in more accurate soil-structure &not;interaction of potential seismic deformations in soils at nuclear power plants sites that are subjected to seismic loading. <br /><br />The results of this work will develop part of the technical basis for an update of Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites" Currently the guide notes that deformation assessments must be undertaken, but provides little guidance as to how that is done. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />All proposals are due in accordance with section L.7 2052.215-72 Timely Receipt of Proposals (OCT 1999). Any proposal not received by the specified time shall be considered late and not accepted into the competition. <br /><br />Any questions a potential offeror may have regarding this RFP must be submitted to the contracting officer, Matthew J. Bucher, in writing at the following e-mail address, <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bucher@nrc.gov">Matthew.Bucher@nrc.gov</a>. All questions must be submitted by May 11, 2011 at Noon (EST). Any question received after this time may not be considered and all answers to any potential questions will be made publicly available through this website. <br /><br />http://www.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html<br /><br />Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. <br />The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. <br /><br />The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $6.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541690.<br /><br />Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving white papers and full proposals for Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Applied Research Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of multi-Service EOD operations. <br /><br />ONR has a need to develop and demonstrate emerging technologies for dismounted missions to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, and render safe/neutralize explosive hazards, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) to support the DoD EOD mission. <br /><br />The EOD mission is to render safe ordnance, including conventional and unconventional, improvised, chemical, biological, and nuclear IEDs and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). It includes land and underwater location, identification, render-safe, and recovery (or disposal) of foreign and domestic ordnance. EOD conducts demolition of hazardous munitions, pyrotechnics, and retrograde explosives using detonation and burning techniques. The EOD mission is unique from the role of other forces, such as combat engineers that support movement of US and allied forces.
<p>An IED is a device placed in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It can include military stores, but normally is devised from non-military components.</p>
<p>White papers and full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Explosive Hazardous Device Detection and Location<br />This area focuses on hand-held technologies that can detect and/or locate the presence of an explosive hazard containing energetic materials. This may include buried, obscured, and/or items out in the open. The explosive hazard may contain military-grade and/or commercial/homemade energetic material.</p>
<p>2) Explosive Hazardous Device Render Safe/ Neutralization <br />This area focuses on new information/capabilities that can be manually or robotically employed and used to neutralize IEDs or render safe conventional munitions, or substantially enhance existing EOD tools and equipment that currently perform the tasks.</p>
<p>3) Explosive Hazardous Device Munition Diagnose and Identification <br />This area focuses on the identification of ordnance and IEDs or IED components, and the materials used in the manufacture of them, including toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), toxic industrial materials (TIM), Biological materials, or Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA). Potential targets can include thick cased munitions, such as artillery shells. Emphasis will be on manually or robotically employed capabilities.</p>
<p>4) Explosive Hazardous Device Access<br />This area focuses on technologies to aid in the approach and/or access IEDs or UXO to gain greater knowledge regarding their physical composition or configuration; particularly through the use of unmanned EOD robotic systems.</p>
<p>Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 24 May 2010. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university. The research shall not be considered fundamental in those rare and exceptional circumstances where the applied research effort presents a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense, and where agreement on restrictions have been recorded in the contract or grant.</p>
<p>White Papers are required prior to submitting a Full Proposal.<br /><br />**NOTE: Posting of Amendment 0003 to the ONR Website will be delayed minimum of 1 day.</p>

<DESC>Subject: Request for Information (RFI) to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security Technology, Passenger Screening Program - Passenger Screening X-ray Technology, Low Density Threshold Analysis.
<p><br />1. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background: TSA is responsible for protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. However, several challenges exist relating to optimizing checkpoint performance. Passenger screening at the checkpoint relies heavily on the Transportation Security Officer's (TSO) interpretation of Passenger Screening X-ray Technology, which can be complex and difficult to interpret. The amount of time spent on this interpretation can factor heavily on overall passenger throughput at the checkpoint. Additionally, screening costs are continuously rising with every new piece of equipment introduced to the checkpoint. TSA believes there may be a security and operational benefit to automatically clearing bags that have a very low probability of containing a threat.</p>
<p>Objective: TSA is currently conducting market research to determine if products currently exist to automatically and efficiently clear low density/low threat items through the passenger screening x-ray technology located at the airport passenger screening checkpoint. TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that addresses the following concepts: <br />&bull; Provides an automated detection algorithm that will reduce the amount of review time required by a screener and increase accuracy</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluates the impact on the required number of TSOs to perform image interpretation and bag searches</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluates the types of threats that could be automatically cleared and those that must be manually reviewed</p>
<p>&bull; Be mindful of space constraints within the common checkpoint environment and potential for changes to layout or procedures</p>
<p>&bull; Identifies hardware/software for identification of data</p>
<p>TSA's objective is to identify a solution that will apply detection algorithms to reliably clear items that do not pose a threat to the aviation transit system. By doing so, higher detection rates will be achieved and passenger's item throughput will be improved. Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain: <br />(1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, <br />(2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a complete solution that meets the above concept(s), and, <br />(3) suggestions on alternative approaches to increase detection of threats and/or increase throughput.</p>

<DESC>Modification 2 - Project Labor Agreement Survey - The 1,085,000 square foot, multi-story new building, including basement and penthouse levels located on Offutt AFB, NE, is being considered as a possible project. Responses due NLT 19 May 2011.<br><br>Modification 1 - Project Labor Agreement Survey - Provide your response to barbara.a.young@usace.army.mil and ensure your response is limited to 5 pages.<br><br>Original - The Corps of Engineers Omaha District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br><br>Request responses to the following questions:<br><br>(1) Should a PLA be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What is the time impact of a PLA on a solicitation response?<br>(8) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in selected Omaha District Corps of Engineers contracts?<br><br><br><br>

Additional equipment will include suction sluice valve, anti-vacuum valve and lifting device(s) to remove/install impeller and casing in the vessel. A reduction gear, drive motor, motor controllers, and ladder mounted dredge piping will also be provided. The acquisition will be a negotiated; best-value procurement performed using the Contracting by Negotiation procurement process prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government in terms of the factors as stated. Award of a contract will not be based solely on a lowest price basis.

A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued with a proposed closing of thirty (30) calendar days from the date the solicitation is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.304, the technical factors as a whole are more important than Price; however, Price remains a significant factor in determining "Best Value". Which are listed in descending order of importance: 1) Product, 2) Management and Organization, 3) Past performance and expertise of the firm in the dredge pump manufacturing and installation field and, 4) Price Reasonableness. Further, the Government has identified desirable features in Section C to provide offerors flexibility to provide the best system. Initial cost proposals must be submitted along with initial technical proposal to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the requirements of "Section L - Proposal Requirements and Evaluation Criteria" of the RFP. The government may award a contract on the basis of initial proposals received without discussions; therefore, each proposal should contain the offeror's best offer. All work shall be in accordance with the specifications and drawings included in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Specific discussion of these factors, format and specific topics to be addressed in the proposal, are listed and described in Section L, "Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors," which contains the specific proposal submittal requirements. Offerors are advised that each proposal submitted shall be complete and in the format required, with information organized as specified in Section L. The award will be made on the basis of these factors. Warranty of supplies/services will apply.

DRAFT Statement of Work

1.	Scope

This statement of work (SOW) covers claims support services to fully develop the information and evidence needed to substantiate Veterans' claims for increased disability compensation benefits and deliver to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) claim packets ready for VA to make a decision.  Claims for increased disability that will be developed under this SOW are defined to include any Veteran's application for an increase in the compensation benefit paid for a disability already determined by VA to be service-connected, including claims for a resumption of payments previously discontinued.

Intake of Veterans' claims for increased compensation to be developed by the contractor shall include claims received at VA regional offices located throughout the nation.  

1.1	Background

VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) administers the disability compensation benefit program, which provides a monetary benefit to Veterans who are disabled by injuries or illnesses that were incurred or aggravated during active military service.  These disabilities are considered to be "service-connected."  The amount of disability compensation payable varies with the degree of disability (if 30% or more disabled) and the number of dependents, and is paid monthly.  Veterans may file claims for increased compensation benefits at any time if their service-connected disabilities become progressively worse.  Veterans with certain severe disabilities may be eligible for additional special monthly compensation.  The benefits are not subject to federal or state income tax. 

Frequently, Veterans already receiving compensation will encounter deterioration of existing conditions that require re-evaluation for increased compensation.  Typically, this category of claims is among the least complex to develop, but nevertheless requires significant time and effort to develop complete packages of evidence in order to decide the claim.  Expedited development and claim package assembly by the contractor will reduce waiting times in communications between the Veteran, medical providers, and VA, facilitating timely compilation of fully developed packages that will be used for final evaluation of whether an increased evaluation is warranted.  The work described in this SOW contributes to VBA's mission by directly reducing the time and effort to fully develop claims and make them ready for decision.

This includes, but is not limited to: computer software, forms, spreadsheets, process innovations, or other intellectual property developed to support claims processing.

After the COTR has received Attachment B form(s) from the contractor, SIC will send an e-mail notification to the contractor and their POC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. SIC will also send reminder notifications to the contractor and their POC if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

Upon receipt of required investigative documents, SIC will review the investigative documents for completion and initiate the background investigation by forwarding the investigative documents to OPM to conduct the background investigation. If the investigative documents are not complete, SIC will return the package to the contractor with corrective instructions.

VA will pay for investigations and reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by OPM in advance; however, the contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bills of Collection from VA.

Technical and Business Questions
for RFI Number:  VA798-11-RI-0071


1.	Is there an Incumbent Contractor?

No

2.	What contractor(s) is/are currently providing this service and how was the prior contract awarded (i.e. GSA schedule, competitive bid)?

None - see above

3.	Does the VA have any current metrics available that reflect the timeliness and error rates for claim packet submissions by the incumbent contractor?

There is currently no incumbent contractor (see above).  The VA is interested in what the Industry Metrics are for similar work.   

4.	Are there any restrictions imposed on the contractor in terms of how the intake of claims received at VA regional offices can occur?

Yes.  VBA currently possess the capability to mail (requires tracking and signature), secured fax claims received to the contractor and secure email is also an option.  If the vendor would like to propose alternate methods to deliver this information, those can be considered, but they must be cost-effective and meet the VA Security Requirements.

5.	Is it a requirement for a contractor to reply to this RFI in order to be considered in the future if a RFP or RFQ is released?

No requirement at this time, but your interest and input is strongly encouraged.  

6.	Do all 56 VBA regional offices share a common network?

Yes.  All 56 VBA regional offices use the same common network.  

7.	Does the VA anticipate that any future contract would be awarded to a single contractor or potentially multiple contractors?

This depends on many variables, including this Market Research.

8.	Are there standard notifications the VA expects to be sent to Veterans and/or their representatives? If so, how many types of notifications are sent? Are the notifications generated through an existing system interface or must the contractor develop the systems to support the notifications to the Veterans and/or their representatives? 

Yes.  There are standard notifications which apply to all claims.   

 There are 4 types of notification (Modern Awards Processing Development (MAP-D) letters, Personal Computer Generated Letters (PCGL) letters, original correspondence, and/or the telephone. 

 The letters are generated using the Veterans Service Network (VETSNET), specifically MAP-D which is used to manage the claims development process, including the collection of data to support the claims and the tracking of claims.     

9.	Is there a standard template or format that the VA expects the contractor to use when notifying Veterans of the steps that contractor is taking to safeguard all PPI information while in the custody of the contractor?

No.  The VA at this time is considering a jointly developed template between the VA Program Office and the Contractor.

10.	For claim packages that are electronically provided, what is the expected format of the claim package to be uploaded (i.e. PDF, TIFF, etc.)?

Searchable PDF.  

11.	The contractor must document initial and required follow-up attempts for documents that the contractor was unable to obtain. Must the information be documented within the Case Workload and Performance Tracking tool, within the CAPRI/VISTA database or within some other VA database?

The information must be documented using MAP-D, which resides on the Corporate Database.  The corporate database is a single repository of all data pertaining to a veteran.  This includes extensive demographic data, dependency information, all development actions, and a record of contacts with the veteran.
 
12.	With respect to the summaries uploaded, one summary requires a description and dates of all unsuccessful attempts to obtain records not received, and the specific reasons for the failure. Is there a desired format of this information (i.e. Microsoft Word document)?

The summary will need to be uploaded as a searchable PDF.  A format for the summary will be provided. 

13.	Following the transmission of records and summaries, the contractor must notify the VA of the submission of the claim packet. What is the VA's preferred method of notification?

The contactor will update the claim status in MAP-D. 

14.	Any mail received by the contractor after file submission is to be promptly reviewed and forwarded to the VA. Must the documentation be electronically uploaded or forwarded to the VA through the mail?

The Program Office at this time would like the original document forwarded to the VA via a traceable courier (USPS, UPS, Fed-Ex) with signature required.

15.	The contractor will be provided access to various systems, including but not limited to VETSNET, MAP-D, Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI/VISTA), VERIS, and others. What are the service level agreements regarding the availability of those systems and when is their scheduled maintenance?

Those systems have a 98%+ availability.  They have scheduled maintenance one Sunday each month.  Otherwise they are available 24 hours a day with very limited exceptions. 

16.	What are the VA's current approved methods of batch interfacing?

The current method for batch interface is via direct-connect. 

17.	Deliverables are to be provided via Microsoft Office compatible formats with project plans being provided using Microsoft Project. Are there specific versions of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Project that the VA expects the contractor to utilize?

Shall provide a MS 2003 readable version


18.	The VA will review 100% of the claim packages uploaded and will complete the review within 90 days of receipt of the claim package. What is the trigger for the contractor's compensation of the uploaded claim package?

Each month VA proposes to pay for all claims which were reviewed during the month, or those claims which have been returned for 90 days or more and not yet reviewed.  

If a contractor would like to propose an alternate compensation methodology, VA is willing to consider it. 

The VA is interested in what the industry standards are and how they would apply in this proposed future solicitation.  

19.	Has the VA established the early delivery incentive and is so, can that information be shared?

VA has not. 

20.	The contractor is to provide a copy of the training certificate for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter. As new employees are hired, is the expectation that the training certificates will be provided within 1 week of the employees hire date?

Yes, within one week.

21.	 What is the Estimated Period of Performance?

The Program Office expects to make an award in the fourth quarter of 2011 and that the performance would run through September 30, 2012.  The contract size and the scope may be extended with the use of contract option(s).

22.	 Will this be a Continuing Requirement?

This remains undetermined at this time.  

23.	 Is there an estimated amount of funding available for this project?

Funding is available for this contract and the exercise of the options.

The project will include design work for the preparation of 100% complete working drawings and contract documents using edited VA Master Specifications to complete the following: 

This project will replace the existing central air conditioning system serving the inpatient pharmacy on the first floor of the building with a new more energy efficient system.  While the AE is encouraged to propose new and innovative systems they must also consider the ease of maintenance and life expectancy that the chosen system will provide.  Several other items that the AE should consider include moving the system from outdoors to the basement of the building as well as a design that could eventually allow service to the second floor of the building. 


Design completion timeframe of 165 days after receipt of the Notice to proceed. The A/E firm shall also be required to perform construction period services after award of the construction project contract. In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction project is between $250,000 through $500,000.

Qualifications (SF330) submitted by each firm for Project 515-11-101 for "Replace Air Conditioning System, B4" will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria: 
Prospective firms are required to address all selection criteria within submitted SF330 packages using additional pages as required and SF 330 submissions including any additional pages are not to exceed fifty (50) pages. Selection criteria shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836.602-1 as follows:

Limit past project references to those within the same scope as this advertisement (see submission requirements below for additional required information).
5.	Geographic location and facilities of the working office(s) which would provide the professional services and familiarity with the area in which the project is located. (Geographical area is limited to a 150 driving mile radius of Saginaw, MI). 
6.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness. Provide any design or other awards received for individuals or the firm as a whole.

All 8 evaluation criteria listed above must be addressed in the SF330. In addition, firms are requested to provide one electronic copy of their entire SF330 submittal via CD. Submission information incorporated by reference is not allowed. 

Prospective SDVOSB firms are reminded that in accordance with VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 852.219-10, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance of the contract shall be spent for employees of the SDVOSB concern or employees of other eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1; Citation: 10 U.S.C. 2304.</p>
<p><br />JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Requiring Activity: <br />Defense information Systems Agency (DISA) <br />DECC Mechanicsburg (CSD)<br />5450 Carlisle Pike<br />Mechanicsburg, PA 17050-0975</p>
<p>Contracting Activity: <br />Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)<br />Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) <br />2300 East Drive, Bldg. 3600<br />Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406.</p>
<p>2. Nature/Description of Action(s):</p>
<p>a. Type of action: Modification to a FFP type order<br />b. Amount: $562,958.40 ( Two month base period of $187,652.80 with (2) two-month option periods of $375,305.60)<br />c. Type of funding: Operation and Maintenance<br />d. Year of funding: FY 2011</p>
<p>This action is for a Firm-Fixed Priced 2-month,with 2 two-month options, extension to provide for the continuation of services currently provided under Valdez contract HC1028-09-P-2019 which expires 31 May 2011. This will be a modification to the current order for the period of from 01 June 11 thru 31 July 2011 with 2 two-month options until the competitive 8a contract is completed. This will ensure no break in service. Current projections are the replacement contract will be awarded in the June 2011 timeframe.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services:</p>
<p>This requirement is for services in support of the</p>
<p>This requirement is for services in support of System Software Programming for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Computing Services. This requirement provides essential services to support DISA's mission and continuity is required to be executed as planned. This is a 2 month modification to an existing order against order HC1028-09-P-2019 until corrective actions have been taken and are resolved in response to the solicitation HC1028-11-R-2011. Not awarding this 2 month (2 month with 2 two-month options) extension would result in a break in service and would be detrimental to the overall accomplishment of the assigned tasks required to meet DISA's mission. Total labor for this effort is approximately $180,652.80 plus $7,000.00 for travel, total life cycle cost is approximately $562,958.40. The Government has a continuing need for these services and it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to extend the period of performance for the order.</p>
<p><br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority:<br />Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications:</p>
<p>a. Valdez International was awarded a requirement for these services on 24 Nov 08. A request for a direct award 8A to Valdez was denied on 26 Oct 10. Due to this denial, it then became necessary to re-compete these services in the 8A arena. Presently, order HC1028-09-P-2019 has exhausted all 6-month extensions, per FAR 52.217-8. This J&amp;A is for a 2 month (with 2 two-month options) extension to HC1028-09-P-2019 until completion of solicitation HC1028-11-R-2011.<br /><br />b. Valdez International is uniquely qualified to provide these services to DISA CSD based upon the following: <br />Valdez International has the core expertise and personnel to execute the required tasks to support CSD's mission. <br />Valdez International has consistently provided the correct talents/skills to accomplish CSD's mission.</p>
<p>c. Unique Capabilites. This award will be for a 2 month (2 months plus 2 two-month options) continuation of services until completion of solicitation HC1028-11-R-2011. During this period the Government requires the continued expert level of performance currently being provided by the incumbent. Because the staff provided by Valdez International has been intimately involved in the development and deployment of the current information technology architecture, they are the only vendor who can provide the continuing level of performance over the next 60 days. Not awarding this 2 month extension to order HC1028-09-P-2019 would result in a break in service and would be detrimental to the overall accomplishment of the assigned tasks required to meet DISA's mission</p>
<p>d. Procurement History: HC1028-09-P-2019 awarded to Valdez International 24 Nov 08. Task Order life cycle amount is $3,147,216.59. Period of performance is from 01 Dec 08 thru 31 May 11. HC1013-07-P-2078 awarded to Valdez International 22 Nov 06. Task order life cycle amount of $2,379,548.80. Period of performance is from 01 Dec 06 thru 30 Nov 08.</p>
<p>6. FedBizOpps (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources:</p>
<p>This requirement was not synopsized. This is a 2 month extension of the sole source order for service until completion of solicitation HC1028-11-R-2011.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: The rates for this 2 month extension of the interim order are the same as the award that the protest was received on, HC1028-09-P-2019, which was based on full and open competition and a price analysis was accomplished. The total estimated value for this Firm Fixed Price (FFP) requirement is $187,652.80, 2-month extension ($375,305.60 for 2 two-month extensions).</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research indicates that the contractor's pricing for the option period is currently fair and reasonable. This is a 2 months with 2 two-month options to the interim award to Valdez International until completion of solicitation HC1028-11-R-2011. The staff of Valdez International has been intimately involved in the development and deployment of the current information technology architecture and they are the only vendor who can provide the continuing level of performance over the next 60 days. Valdez International is the only contractor that can perform the work within a reasonable cost and schedule.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Energy Business Center, 4141 Rockside Rd., Seven Hills, Ohio, 44131.

2.	Nature/Description of Action

This activity proposes to issue an RFP to Lee & Ryan Environmental Consulting, Inc., an SDVOSB, for three (3) separate E85 Fueling Stations, one to be installed at the Clement J Zablocki VA Medical Center, located at 5000 West National Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53295, one at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center, located at 325 East H Street, Iron Mountain, MI 49801, and one at the Edward Hines VA Medical Center, located at 5000 S. Fifth Avenue, Hines, IL 60141.  There are also options for the fuel stations to be powered with Solar PV and include storage batteries.  The government estimate for the base and all options is $833,911.20.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services

The E85 fueling stations will be 12,000 gallons at Milwaukee, 5,000 gallons at Iron Mountain and 10,000 gallons at Hines, and the contractor shall be responsible for all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, design, site preparation, services, training, lighting, camera(s), landscaping, communications, schematic layout, drawings, instruction, Operation and Maintenance manuals, As Built drawings, permits and zoning processes, design, construction, installation and commissioning.  The system shall include the following:

A.	The fueling station tank shall be double-walled and ballistic proof.  The skid shall be anchored to the new concrete foundation.  The concrete foundation design shall be prepared and stamped by a structural engineer licensed in the states of Wisconsin and Illinois, respectively.  The fuel will be delivered to the storage tank from the fuel transport truck by means of a dedicated remote fuel transfer pump that is integrated to the fueling station.  The fueling station pump will supply fuel to the fuel dispenser located in, or adjacent to, the containment area.  A Programmable Logic Control (PLC) panel will control the fuel system.

B.	The fuel tank, pumps, dispensers and related equipment shall be skid mounted and provided as a turn-key system.  The contractor shall provide an integrally constructed and fabricated, tested and certified system prior to delivery to the VA site.  The tank shall contain a product decal specific to the site.  Where required, containment structures shall be constructed of steel-reinforced concrete.

C.	Provide on-demand, monitoring and reporting of actual fuel consumption, vehicle ID, odometer reading, date of fueling and gallons dispensed.  Date of fuel transport shall be included.

D.

The controller shall be compatible with the GSA controller to assist in the reimbursement for the E85 fuel.  The system shall be connected to one or more remote billing services by telephone modem for a high speed line, for the purpose of remotely authorizing, recording, and billing transactions by fuel networks (such as Voyager).  The Contractor shall be responsible for setting up the remote billing accounts coordinated by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR). (See Appendix C)
