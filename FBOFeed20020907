<DESC>NA Background:  The National Park Service Risk Management Program engaged three Contractors, beginning in Fiscal Year 1999, in a Park Assistance Contract.  These Contractors were to assist designated National Park Service Sites in establishing successful occupational safety and health programs for those sites.  The goal was to assist the park/site in developing a process that would result in full implementation of the NPS "Risk Management Program Elements," (fundamental elements of a successful occupational safety and health program) including methods to establish and sustain safe work practices and environments in those sites.  The purpose of this current effort is to determine if the ongoing Park Assistance Contract has achieved its intent, and if not, why not.  Written surveys and telephone interviews will be used.  The survey contractor shall meet with the Risk Management Program Staff Representatives within three weeks of award of this contract to discuss project scope, including an understanding of Key Indicators of a successful Occupational Safety and Health Program, and shall then develop a project plan that defines tasks, milestones, schedules, and final product.  Total time of contract to completion and submission of final report shall not exceed 120 days from date of start of contract.  A preliminary written report is required at 50% of completion.--Develop a written survey and a related survey to be used in phone interviews, to determine the effectiveness of the contractors' and the parks' participation in the contract, including the effectiveness of the contractor's assistance to the park, following the contractor's departure.  The survey must present an impartial representation of opinions and knowledge about the effectiveness at each park site.--At least 30 parks/sites will be surveyed, Park Service-wide; a variety of employees within a park may be included in the survey, either with a written survey, or by phone interview, including the Superintendent, Division Chiefs, Maintenance and Ranger Staff, Safety Representatives, and other employees.  The present Contractors, as well as the Risk Management Staff also shall be included in the survey.--Additional analysis of existing information about the Contractor's assistance to each park/site should be included in the formation of the findings and recommendations.--A Final Written Report will be presented in person to the NPS Risk Manager and others within 120 days from start of project, giving a detailed analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each contractor, and the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of the parks participation in the contract.  Solicitation Packages may not be acquired in person, by mail, or fax..  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Requests for the Solicitation Packages will be accessed through the Government point of entry: http://www.eps.gov/.

<CONTACT>John Sherman Contracting Officer 3032360225     John_Sherman@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management's Eastern States Office, specifically the Division of Cadastral Survey & Government Lands Office is in need of acquiring large format color scanning capabilities to accommodate the scanning of survey plats, track books and other large format documents.   Manufacturers of color scanners were researched through the internet utilizing various line reviews of large format scanners and articles from the National Archives and Library of Congress concerning scanning were used in order to identify companies that produced the type of scanners capable of meeting their requirements in both document size (19"x24" minimum size, image resolution (minimum 300DPI) and protection of source documents.  Considering factory authorized representative locations relative to the Eastern States office and the short warranty period (i.e. 30 days) the logical choice of the two-flatbed color scanners found to meet this offices minimum requirement is the Zeutschel Ominiscan 1000 flatbed color scanner.  The additional capabilities provided by this scanner in both resolution and size will allow this office to include documents and bound materials that would normally have required their book conservators to break open these bound documents prior to scanning.  The National Archives and Library of Congress also use Zeutschel equipment, this would allow for the possibility of future collaborations with a minimum amount of reconfiguration of software and equipment in scanning the Eastern States records that are housed at these facilities.  Under FAR Part 12, Commercial Items and on a brand name or equal basis, the Bureau of Land Management is requesting one each of the following: Zeutschel Omniscan 10000 Color Scanner; HX-435-1 Color Scanner OS-10000-600dpi; HX-4015 Top Light Table AT 1 with glass plate; HX-4543 Software kit Omniscan 10.x, Step-up Transformer; and Installation and Training.  All responsive offers will be evaluated.  If offering other than the brand name, then specific literature must be provided implicitly stating exactly how the or equal product(s) qualifies.  The standard SIC/NAICS classification is 3861/421420.  Anticipated issue date of the Request for Quote will be on or about September 23, 2002.  Quotes are due on September 27, 2002 by 3 p.m. Mountain Time.  Requests for a copy of the Request for Quote must be faxed to 303-236-9470 if unable to gain access thru this electronic commerce site.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition procedures to Claritas, Inc., 1525 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22209 to renew its license for Claritas to provide to SSA an advanced demographics and marketing database package called iMARK Online. SSA previously purchased this license under SSA order 0440-01-51227 issued 8/29/2001. The database package contains additional detailed demographics data currently provided to SSA under the REZIDE database as well as discrete interlinked marketing databases called Demographics, PRIZM segmentation, and MRI Media Complete. Claritas Corporation is the only source for this data. The Claritas product contains specific demographic and marketing information databases needed to help SSA reach specific population segments. SSA proposes to purchase Claritas site licenses for 15 SSA users. Claritas will host the databases for SSA on its website. Since SSA's Public Understanding Measurement System (PUMS) contractor also has a similar Claritas sit license, SSA's purchase of the iMARK package license will allow SSA and the PUMS contractor to "tag" the PUMS data with the Claritas data. This will give SSA the ability to produce customized PUMS demographic reports via the iMARK system. It is critical that these databases be compatible so that SSA's public affairs specialists will gain one-step access to all available data. No other databases are known to be available or could be substituted without substantial increased costs to the government. This is an announcement of SSA?s intent to issue an order to Claritas, Inc for the iMARK database license; SSA will not issue a solicitation.  SSA will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement.  Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a firm other than Claritas Inc. can provide the database license and training as described above.  If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 5 days of its publication, it will issue a purchase order to Claritas Inc. for the iMARK license. Respondents should refer to iMARK license.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to develop an electronic interface that transmits data between itself and its partners in the Disability processing program.  Under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USC 402 and 416), SSA mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits.  In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities.  SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. There are approximately 117 DDS sites nationally.  DDS sites are diverse in size, ranging from staff of 2 to 875, although most fall in the 35 to 350 range. 
 Many of the states use licensed proprietary software developed by I. Levy and Associates, Inc.  They have contracts specific to each state and they have state maintenance agreements with I. Levy and Associates, Inc. to support the code.  In addition, each state has, by necessity and choice, customized the code to meet their specific requirements.  The current lines of code vary from state to state, depending on the degree of customization and the interface to the state systems, but a representative estimate is approximately 1,000,000 lines of code per state.
Over the last few years, SSA and the DDSs have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs.  These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs.  SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program.  The revised strategy, the Electronic Disability system (eDib), is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder.   The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases.  The first step towards implementing the Electronic Folder will involve creating a generic interface between SSA and the DDSs.  SSA will identify and describe the interface standards and the initial set of data elements.   SSA is seeking a contractor who can develop and test the generic interface and the necessary modifications to the DDS software systems.  The contractor will be required to work with the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. User Group to identify data elements that should be propagated into their legacy system.  The legacy system software will then be modified to utilize these agreed upon elements.  These modifications should be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional I. Levy and Associates, Inc states.  This interface must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems, so as to minimize potential work flow impact and the need for user retraining.  SSA will not provide the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. proprietary source code.  Vendors having the capability and experience to provide such a service are invited to submit complete details.  The details must include the following:
- Demonstrated success in writing and supporting COBOL applications on the IBM AS/400 platform;  
- A detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used in dealing with the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. proprietary source code and data structures. Responses must clearly state the ability to provide the service required.  Interested parties must respond to this notice in writing within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication.  Please refer to LJH-02-002.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.   REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE HONORED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.
