Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes. However, all inquiries received by 8 December 2008, 3:00 pm MST, will be considered by the Government.

<p>Sole Source is based upon the contractor providing control system program engineering and modifications to add additional systems to an existing network. Professional Videographics currently owns the source code programming for this network. Outside programming would result in substantial duplication of effort with an attempt to integrate their programming into the existing network. While the additional systems could be independently programmed, the issue of interoperability failure between systems is unacceptable for the mission.</p>

<DESC><BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Center intends to procure for Surveillance Detection training services for the The United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO). The contractor shall conduct a five-day training and orientation course designed to prepare DoD and contracted personnel for Security Assistance missions (Security Assistance Team Training Orientation Course-SATTOC).  The focus of the training is on Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  The current global threat situation requires that additional training be offered to further ensure that deployed personnel are better prepared to protect themselves.  Throughout the world, kidnappings and assassinations are increasingly more popular as terrorist operational choices.  A key aspect of each of these operations is conducting a thorough surveillance of the target.  Detecting that surveillance is critical to upsetting the operational schedule of the terrorists and preventing the action from taking place.  USASATMO will add this training to SATTOC.  The goal of the Surveillance Detection Training is to ensure that deploying personnel can understand, recognize and defeat or counter the tactics, techniques, and procedures terrorists, kidnappers or assassins use to conduct surveillance.  The realism of the surveillance experience should sensitize each trainee to the circumstances of hostile surveillance and heighten the trainees awareness of hostile surveillance.<BR>The contractor shall develop and provide counter-surveillance instruction and practical exercise: Develop materials for the training.  These materials will list enabling and terminal learning objectives, enemy TTPs trainees must detect and counter friendly counter surveillance TTPs and the general scheme for the surveillance practical exercise.  Present a two-hour block of classroom instruction on surveillance detection tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) including Surveillance Detection Routes-SDRs, that instructs the trainees in these TTPs and establishes as their objectives to defeat or counter those techniques during the ensuing week, and to accurately report surveillance they have detected.  The contractor shall have already begun surveillance the previous day. As a practical exercise, conduct surveillance on trainees for five days beginning Monday of each SATTOC week. Times of surveillance shall not conform to the normal duty day, but shall engage the subjects during their activities before 0800 and after 1600 daily.  Observers shall document trainee activity with written reports, still photography, and video. As a result of this training, deploying USASATMO personnel understand and have practiced terrorist surveillance TTP, detection techniques, and understand the weaknesses to correct and skills to enhance in their Individual Protection Measures (IPM).  The surveillance experience has sensitized them and made them more alert to hostile surveillance.<BR><BR>The Period of Performance will be 12 months after date of award with four option periods. <BR><BR>The designated NAICS code is 611699 for this effort, the size standard is $7 mil. <BR>This is a total business set aside procurement. <BR><BR>Solicitation Number will be W911S0-09-R-0003.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Center intends to procure for Contractor support in the preparation and instruction of the country-specific Country Orientation services for the The United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO). In response to requests from U.S. representatives in allied countries, the United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO or SATMO) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, deploys military, Government civilian and contractor-staffed training and technical assistance teams to those countries.  In most cases these teams are stationed in country for a period of time from one week to two years. The team members work directly with host nation armed forces personnel and live on the host nation (local) economy.  The Contractor shall provide all materials and training to prepare SATMO deploying soldier teams with the knowledge required to conduct day to day activities (doing business) within the specific host nations to which each soldier team is assigned. The Contractor shall prepare cultural, business practice and general living materials (to include illustrated handouts) in MS Word and/or MS PowerPoint format (as determined by the Contractor) that will train deploying personnel in the techniques and behaviors required to avoid problems and exploit advantages while conducting day to day activities (doing business) in a foreign country.  Although much of the information to be provided by the Contractor may be general or regional in nature, it shall, as far as possible, be specific to each nation.  The Contractor shall note that trainees will already have received training (from a separate source) on the general importance and role of cross-cultural communication and sensitivity.  The Contractor shall provide these materials electronically to SATMO one workday before the relevant date the class is to start.  The Contractor-provided training shall orient the trainee(s) in the use of that training material provided as a part of the SATTOC course.  The Contractor shall place an emphasis on how to use the materials and shall present in a lecture/conference format, dos and donts of social behavior and differences between practices and customs in the subject country and the United States.  The Contractor shall facilitate the lecture/conference through the use of projected images that provide, as a minimum, an outline and key points of the lecture/conference.  The Contractor shall select from the training content, based on the maximum class time of three hours, those techniques or teaching points most important and suitable for video, audio or personal demonstration or practical exercise.  Note  at the end of this period of instruction the Contractor shall allow for fifteen (15) minutes of questions and answers.  Based on generally accepted principles of instructional development, the contractor shall determine the learning objectives for the selected content (for example:  recognize, recall, state, demonstrate, identify) and select the training technique most appropriate for each learning objective.  For example, the contractor would train the trainees to recognize and identify hand and other body gestures and state the meaning of each; state the appropriate dress for given business or social situations, and recognize, understand and imitate key language cues to include greetings, polite terms and how to express a need for assistance.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>The Period of Performance will be 12 months after date of award with four option periods. <BR><BR>The designated NAICS code is 611699 for this effort, the size standard is $7 mil. <BR>This is a total business set aside procurement. <BR><BR>Solicitation Number will be W911S0-09-R-0005.

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a request for proposals, and unsolicited proposals will not be accepted.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for information received as a result of this solicitation.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently considering an effort utilizing highly specialized and skilled engineering and technical resources to design, develop, test, implement, deploy and support its Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system, which is a planned initiative to enhance the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) decision support tool.  TMA is currently used by Traffic Management Specialists to optimize the flow of aircraft into capacity-constrained areas using time based separation, otherwise known as metering.  TBFM will build upon existing TMA functionality to fulfill user operational needs and Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) commitments.  PURPOSEThe purpose of this market survey is to assess market interest in the above stated requirement, and assess the capabilities of potential offerors through Industry responses.  The responses to this market survey will be used to determine industry interest and capabilities for improving and enhancing the time based metering capabilities of TMA.
The information gathered from this survey will be used to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside competition, in whole or in part, among small businesses and/or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. Small businesses are requested to submit a Business Declaration Form (see attached).  This effort employs The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  This restricts small businesses to a size standard of no more than 500 employees.  A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not exclude the vendor from competition.  
Submission requirements and instructions are provided in Attachment 1 to this survey.  Respondents are required to complete the Business Declaration Form at Attachment 2.  A draft TBFM Statement of Work is included at Attachment 3.
All responses to this Market Survey should be received no later than December 30, 2008.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Interested parties with questions are encouraged to send email to the Contracting Officer, John Gamble, at john.gamble@faa.gov.  Your questions must be submitted no later than close of business December 22, 2008.  Questions will no longer be accepted after this date.

The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program (Monitoring Program) is seeking technically sound projects that gather information to manage and conserve subsistence fishery resources in Alaska.  The program also is directed at supporting meaningful involvement in fisheries management by Alaska Native and rural organizations and promoting collaboration among Federal, State, Alaska Native and local organizations.  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program encompasses awards made through both Federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This Request for Proposals is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  This Request for Proposals # 701819R123 will be posted on http://www.fedbizopps.gov  and  http://www.grants.gov.
As in past years, studies that gather, analyze, and report information needs for subsistence fisheries management on Federal public lands in Alaska (National Wildlife Refuges, National Forests, National Parks and Preserves, National Conservation Areas, National Wild and Scenic River Systems, National Petroleum Reserves, and National Recreation Areas) will be considered.
Proposals are to be submitted to the Office of Subsistence Management by January 12, 2009, 5:00 PM Alaska time.
Funding Opportunity Description
The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) has established guidelines for proposals to successfully compete for funding.  Activities that fall outside the scope of the Monitoring Program and will not be considered include: habitat protection, mitigation, restoration, and enhancement; hatchery propagation, restoration, enhancement and supplementation; and contaminant assessment, evaluation, and monitoring.  These important activities are most appropriately addressed by the responsible land management or regulatory agency, not the Monitoring Program.  In addition, projects for which the primary objective is capacity building (e.g., science camps, technician training, intern programs), are not eligible for funding under the Monitoring Program.  However, projects with capacity building as a secondary objective are encouraged, and partnerships/capacity building is one of the ranking criteria used to evaluate proposals.    The Monitoring Program provides approximately $7 million annually in funding to support research on and monitoring of Federal subsistence fisheries in Alaska.  The funding commitments to multiple year projects influence the amount of funding available each year for new projects.  In 2010, approximately $6.5 million will be available to fund new monitoring and research projects needed to sustain Federal subsistence fisheries for rural Alaskans on Federal lands; remaining funding is obligated to existing projects.  
Proposed requests for funding may be up to four years duration for long-term monitoring projects.  Proposals for new project starts can be for up to four years duration. 
Although all proposals addressing Federal subsistence fisheries will be considered, the Office of Subsistence Management is targeting this Request for Proposals towards specific priority issues and projects identified either by strategic planning efforts or by expert opinion from Regional Advisory Councils, fisheries managers, the Technical Review Committee, and the Office of Subsistence Management staff.  A list of priority information needs is included in the application package (see IV. Application and Submission below).    Investigators wishing to address information needs other than those identified in the attached list must include a compelling rationale regarding strategic importance and application to Federal subsistence management. 
Award Information
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Service will award multiple cooperative agreements and contracts for selected fisheries investigation projects.  Continuation of funding for year two, three or four of multiple-year projects is contingent upon attainment of the study objectives and availability of future government funding.
Eligibility
Individuals and organizations that have the necessary technical and administrative abilities and resources to ensure successful completion of studies may submit proposals.  Entities submitting proposals may be independent investigators, Alaska Native organizations, government agencies, academic institutions, regional fishery organizations, or consulting firms.
Applicants and organizations that are included on the Federal Government's Excluded Parties Listing Systems (EPLS) cannot submit proposals.  Inclusion on the EPLS listing system indicates debarment from doing business under Federal procurement and/or non-procurement (cooperative agreement) programs.  See http://www.epls.gov for the most current listing of debarred organizations.
Monitoring Program funding is intended to provide new and improved information for management of subsistence fisheries on Federal public lands, and not duplicate existing programs.  Thus, OSM highly discourages agencies shifting their existing projects to the Monitoring Program.  Where long-term projects can no longer be funded by agencies, and the project provides direct information for Federal subsistence fisheries management, the policy is to allow a maximum request to the Monitoring Program of up to 50% of the project cost.  For new projects with broad overlap of Federal and State management authority, a substantial match in funding must be included in order to be considered for Monitoring Program funding.  However, applicants are encouraged to document matching contributions.  Proposals with substantial cost sharing may be ranked higher than similar proposals with no identified cost sharing.
Application and Submission
Address to Request Application Materials and Contact for Further InformationApplicants may request further informatoin or an application package from Kathy Orzechowski, Fisheries Division, Office of Subsistence Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 East Tudor Road, MS 121, Anchorage, Alaska 99503, phone: 907-786-3645, fax: 907-786-3612, email: fisheries_resource_monitoring@fws.gov.

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities Draft/ Synopsis


The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding testing of a proposed new anthrax vaccine.

The Metabolism Branch, NCI has developed a safer and more immunogenic vaccine candidate against anthrax by integrating a codon-optimized gene encoding the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis into the genome of Dryvax (Wyeth) vaccinia strain and Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) strain of vaccinia virus. The purpose of this procurement is to ascertain the efficacy of this NCI-owned vaccine against an experimental challenge of B. anthracis in a specific rabbit model of disease and it is necessary for the government to correlate immunological findings of the NCI owned vaccine candidate against anthrax with results from other completed studies.  This challenge study will provide critical information as to the immunogenicity, reactogenecity and correlates of immunity for these anthrax vaccines in an appropriate, validated small animal model (Hermanson, G. et al PNAS, 2004, 101: 13601-13606), a required step before a vaccine could be used in people.

It is critical that the facility performing this evaluation is experienced with the complex methodology of procuring and housing rabbits under appropriate conditions for aerosol inoculation with the targeted B. anthracis spore (Ames strain) inhaled dose. The facility performing this testing must be able to provide a validated stock of known lethal dose titrer B. anthracis spores for the aerosol inoculation required and to perform bacteremia evaluations on serum after bleeding the injected rabbits from an auricular artery or vein.
  
This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on December 18, 2008.  For further information please contact Michael Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinomic@mail.nih.gov .   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-80064-MM.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment and tools necessary to install 52 government-provided 6 X 6 X 16, CCA pressure treated marine piles at two locations in Florida Bay pilings.  This will require two small vessels with a draft of no more than 18-24 inches.
The Government shall furnish 57 each, 6 X 6 X 16 foot, CCA treated marine piles. A quantity of 52 piles will be installed with five additional piles provided in case of breakage during driving operations. Unused piles will be returned to the government.
The contractor shall work with Everglades National Park Maintenance staff to determine the exact location of the two camping facilities.  The work is located in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay.  The two sites are accessed through the Florida Bay boat ramp located in the Flamingo district of the park. Flamingo is 50 miles southwest of Homestead/Florida City.  The new pile locations are in approximately 3-4 feet of water and are 6 1/2 and 7 miles from shore, at coordinates
Access to the work locations require navigation of shallow and narrow channels. Typically, boats of no more than 20 feet in length and a draft of 18 inches access these areas. This would preclude use of any standard construction barge without risking damage to the fragile benthic resources found in Florida Bay. Any vessel with a draft of more than two feet or beam greater than 15 feet could not access these work locations.  Vessel fitted with turbidity control equipment is preferred.  Piles will be laid out according to the pile/framing plan and driven to a minimum depth of 5  feet into the sea bottom but no more than 6 feet and cut to a finish elevation by others.  All work will be performed in accordance with F.D.E.P. and U.S.A.C.E. permit requirements.

The order will provide for non-recurring engineering and retrofit kits for the development and integration of utility outlets one DC and one AC to power the Rapid Ground Refueling (RGR) Forward Area Refueling Equipment (FARE) on V-22 Osprey Aircraft.  The customer designed and procured new RGR (rapid ground refueling) capable MATS tanks.  The new tanks make use of a FARE (forward area refueling equipment) kit to offload fuel to other vehicles.  This FARE kit contains a pump package that requires A/C and DC power currently not available on the V22.  Bell-Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and producer of the V-22 Tiltrotor aircraft and is the only known source that possesses the engineering data, technical skills, and requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, operation, maintenance and support characteristics of the aircraft. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with Bell-Boeing at the following address: Bell-Boeing, 401 Tiltrotor Drive, Amarillo, TX 79111-1200. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Trainings (CNATRA) TC-12B (Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200) pilot training program.  The following individual pilot training courses are required: The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires the following individual pilot training courses: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.147); Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.153); Intermediate Tiltrotor TC-12B Flight Training (see CNATRAINST 1542.145). Additional requirements include conducting Flight Checks, VIP/Winging Events and additional Simulator training as required. The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination. At the successful completion of this training the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating. The purpose of the Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training is to provide designated aviators with appropriate flight procedures, instructional methodologies and techniques to instruct undergraduate flight students in the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS and Intermediate E-2/C-2 phases of flight training. The Transition Training will prepare designated pilots with dissimilar flying experience for Naval Test Pilot School or for duty with a Maritime Patrol Fleet Replacement Squadron.  The above listed Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training can also be performed in three separate and distinct training blocks as follows: a)  Copilot MPTS Training - the first block of Multi-Engine Flight Instructor Training, consists of the systems course as well as the first five CPT events; b)  Aircraft Commander Upgrade Training -  the second block of Transition Training, consists of two  basic instrument and three radio instrument simulator events; c)  Flight Instructor Upgrade Training - the third and final block of transition training.  The purpose of the Intermediate Tiltrotor TC-12B Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this phase of aviation training, the student will enter Advanced MV-22 helicopter training. Flight Checks are required for flight instructors and winged aviators and are flown as recurrent training.  Training is a single, 1.5-hour simulator event flown for proficiency.  VIP/Winging Events are special events that are public relations in nature.  These events are in direct support of Student Winging days and take place approximately every three weeks on average.  Additional simulator time will be used in support of student training as required.  CNATRA currently provides in-house TC-12B pilot training through various sources, including both government and contractor personnel and equipment. The contractor will be required to provide: all certified instructors, two TC-12B Flight Training Devices (FTD), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices and any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; and data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training. The government will provide: facilities to support two TC-12B FTDs and associated contract personnel, all required course curricula/syllabi, and any additional government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of TC-12B pilots. These TC-12B training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using two TC-12B FTDs.  The FTDs required shall simulate the performance and functional operation of the TC-12B aircraft and shall minimally meet FAA Level 6 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  In addition, the FTDs shall provide a freeze and reset capability and a minimum of a three-channel visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 40-degree vertical field of view and simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.  The contractor shall provide training in Building 1824 at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas.  The contractor shall use the government-furnished facilities and course syllabi in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors shall; have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours, have knowledge of  DoD rules and regulations governing aircraft operations, and be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.

NOTE:(1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard.(2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee's clearance status may suffice depending on the employee's status within the JPAS database.(3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material.(4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) Philadelphia intends to solicit and negotiate a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for modification and repair of Bell H-1 helicopters, components, and peculiar support equipment with Bell Helicopter Textron (Bell).  The duration of the BOA will be for a 5 year period.  All items are proprietary in nature for which Bell owns the drawings and data rights, and may include some modifications that have not been developed as of the date of publication. 

The Government intends to proceed under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  Bell Helicopter Textron is considered the only supplier, as they have designed and developed the systems that would be modified or repaired under this BOA.  However, the Government will consider all responsible sources and they may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency if received within 15 days after the publication of this synopsis.  Information received as a result of this presolicitation notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Bell owns the technical drawings, specifications and data rights for this product group, the Government does not.  

This is a presolicitation notice and is prepared in accordance with FAR 5.207.  The final dollar value of this action will be determined by the actual delivery orders issued.  The anticipated value is not expected to exceed  $24,000,000.  This announcement constitutes the only advertised solicitation; subcontracting opportunities would be available from Bell Helicopter Textron, 600 E Hurst Blvd, Hurst, TX 76101.

A BOA is not acontract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; instead, it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA.  Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition.  PURPOSE:   OEM seeks technical support and expertise for the laboratory analysis of environmental samples for the presence, release, and/or detection of hazardous chemical and biological agents that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare, or the environment in support of emergency responses to possible chemical, or bio-terrorism acts.

<SOLNBR>FHFA-09-R-0002
<CONTACT>Janice L. Uthe, Phone (202) 414-8974, Email janice.uthe@fhfa.gov
<DESC><p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was established by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (the Act), Title XIII of Public Law 102-550. The primary function of OFHEO is to ensure the capital adequacy and the financial safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), the dominant participants in the secondary mortgage market. OFHEO currently uses both a minimum capital measure and a risk-based capital measure to assess the capital adequacy of the Enterprises. On July 26, 2008, Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which merged OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board to create a new Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
<p>FHFA is considering developing a new risk based capital requirement that is consistent with best practice economic capital modeling in the financial services industry. In general, economic capital refers to any risk-based measure of capital necessary to protect against unexpected losses over a given period of time and at a given confidence level. Typically, economic capital models have market, credit and operational risk components that are estimated, forecasted, or simulated either separately or jointly. FHFA is seeking to acquire a flexible off-the-shelf Economic Capital Modeling software package with which to implement the risk based capital requirement for the Enterprises. Under this solicitation, FHFA is seeking a software package to implement the market and credit risk components only of economic capital, the software installation and implementation, model set up and user training, and software support modifications/updates, licensing, and maintenance.</p>
<p>FHFA anticipates soliciting and awarding a single Labor-Hour contract. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is unrestricted. NAICS Code 511210 is applicable, and the small business size standard is $25 million. It is anticipated that Solicitation No. FHFA-09-R-0002 will be released in January, 2009, via posting on this website. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available. All offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">http://www.ccr.gov</a>.</p>
<p><br />All questions and correspondence shall be addressed to Janice Uthe at janice.uthe@fhfa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The purposed contract action is for services for commercial items, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904. POC for this action is Theresa Alkeus, (252)334-5174.

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<BR><BR>Capabilities to Collect Time-Space-Position Information in GPS-Denied Urban Environments<BR>Posted Date: December 03, 2008<BR>Response Date: January 09, 2009<BR><BR>Description<BR><BR>Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) systems which rely heavily on the Global Positioning System (GPS)-based data to locate and orient humans, ground vehicles, ground robots, and low flying air vehicles in urban environments face severe challenges when GPS radio frequency (RF) signals are attenuated or blocked due to non line of sight (NLOS) to GPS satellites.  GPS signals may be degraded or completely blocked due to operation near or within manmade structures either above or below ground level.  GPS RF signal reception may also be degraded by either intentional (e.g., jamming) or unintentional (e.g., multi-path reflected waves, cell phone usage) interference.  For the purposes of this RFI, environments with unreliable or denied reception of GPS signals due primarily to NLOS RF signal blockage are identified as GPS-Denied environments. This RFI does not include situations where GPS RF signals are degraded primarily to interference.  This will be addressed in a future RFI.<BR><BR>The Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), working with the PEO STRI Acquisition Center, is using this RFI to solicit technical concepts and approaches for future TSPI-related system and system-of-systems assessment capabilities that cannot be achieved today using GPS alone in an urban environment.  TSPI approaches must consider the collection of highly accurate time, 3-dimensional location (space) information, and the orientation (position) of individuals, vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.  If real-time TSPI reporting is required, then the collection, transmission, and reception of data should be considered.  TSPI would also include tag information of the entity being tracked.  TSPI does not include other telemetry data such as system status, temperature, video, etc.<BR><BR>For all three topics below, the following should be considered:<BR>"Various types of above ground urban infrastructures; including attached and closely spaced inner-city buildings, widely spaced high-rise office buildings, attached houses, closely spaced industrial/storage buildings, widely spaced apartment buildings, detached houses, and widely spaced industrial/storage buildings.<BR>"Various types of building designs and materials; including building walls with combinations of concrete, steel, wood, and stucco; A-frame roofs made of wood, asphalt shingle, slate, and/or ceramic tile; flat roofs made of wood, shingle, tar, and/or stones; roofs made with reinforced concrete. Reconfigurable urban test sites must also be considered.  These sites usually use stackable metal (e.g., steel) containers.<BR>"Metro and utility tunnels which connect areas and buildings.  Small tunnels may be made with 2-meter diameter concrete pipes, with 30 cm thick walls, and with the top of pipes under at least 2 meters of dirt and/or concrete/asphalt.  Larger tunnels, as for metro systems, can accommodate trains and train stations are 5-10 meters below the ground.<BR>"Must operate in a tightly spaced areas cluttered with debris and electromagnetic interference (EMI) characteristic of a populated urban environment (i.e., unintentional interference).<BR>"Must operate in extremes of weather (e.g., extreme temperatures and precipitation).<BR>"Must be able to identify and track entities (soldiers, robots, vehicles, etc.) for up to four hours in a GPS-Denied status to the four positions accuracies stated in the following section (low, moderate, high, and very high fidelity).<BR>"It is desired that TSPI solutions be scalable to accommodate 100s to 1,000s of entities.<BR>"Solutions should attempt to avoid dependence on static, previously wired sites for emplacement of TSPI instrumentation. <BR>"Solutions should support distributed live-virtual-constructive (L-V-C) test environments utilized to match scope (e.g., city the size of Fallujah) and safety requirements (e.g., separating live close air support missions from live dismounted warfighters) of test events.  Considerations include:<BR> -Sites for the test events are located in geographically separated areas. <BR> -Joint fires with wide area weapons may be either live or constructive at remote Air, Naval, or Army bases.<BR> -TSPI approaches should be sufficient to support real-time data collection (note: time latencies due to distributed networks should not be considered)<BR><BR>TOPICS<BR><BR>Responses of interest may address the following three topics or other related topics: <BR><BR>1.TSPI for dismounted personnel in operational urban test environments<BR>A capability is needed to acquire TSPI for dismounted personnel in operational urban test environments to assess the performance of blue force personnel, performance of blue force tracking systems, assessment of information systems (e.g., battle command systems that depict friendly forces, opposing forces, and non-combatants), interactions with non-combatants, as well as to support safety and test control.   The TSPI should be seamless as personnel move from within to outside structures and vice-versa.  TSPI should be of adequate resolution to identify/track individual friendly, enemy, non-combatants, and test personnel, including challenges such as:<BR>"For low fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 1.0m)<BR> -Tracking safety and test personnel<BR>"For moderate fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 0.25m)<BR> -Identifying the location and position of individuals leaning against a wall or in prone position on a floor<BR>"For high fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 0.15m)<BR> -Delineating individuals grouped tightly together (e.g. squad/team is stacked against a wall before entering a room)<BR> -Identifying basic body orientation (standing, kneeling, lying down) of individuals<BR>"For very high fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- less than 0.10m, Orientation Accuracy +/- 0.1 degree))<BR> -Identifying the more detailed body orientations (e.g., direction of head) of individuals <BR> -Identifying the orientation of handheld systems (e.g., weapons, sensors)<BR> -Recognizing hand and arm signals<BR><BR>There is limited space, weight, and power capacity on the dismounted warfighters for TSPI equipment.<BR><BR>2.TSPI for small UAS in operational urban test environments<BR>A capability is needed to acquire TSPI for small (man portable) ground and air unmanned autonomous systems (UAS) in operational urban test environments to assess the performance of small UAS, performance of blue force tracking systems, and interactions with non-combatants; as well as to support safety and test control.  TSPI should be of adequate resolution to identify/track individual small friendly and enemy UAS, as well as small UAS that may be supporting safety and test data collection.  Challenges for TSPI will be similar to those identified for the dismounted Warfighter since they are similar in size and will be interacting within the same battlespace (i.e. inside/outside buildings, tunnels, narrow alleys, etc.):<BR>"For low fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 1m)<BR> -Support of tracking for range safety and test auxiliary UAS (camera, sensor platform, etc)<BR>"For moderate fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 0.25m)<BR> -Identifying the location and position of UAS close to walls or on the floor for ground systems or next to the ceiling for air vehicles<BR>"For high fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- 0.15m)<BR> -Delineating UAS and other UAS or UAS with humans grouped tightly together <BR>"For very high fidelity TSPI (Position Accuracy +/- less than 0.1 m, Orientation Accuracy +/- 0.1 degree)<BR> -Identifying the more detailed orientations (e.g., orientation of chassis or airframe) of UAS <BR> -Identifying the orientation of UAS subsystems (e.g., weapons, sensors)<BR><BR>There is somewhat less available space, weight, and power capacity on small UAS as with dismounted warfighters for TSPI equipment.<BR><BR>3.TSPI to support real time casualty assessment (RTCA) in operational urban test environments<BR>A capability is needed to acquire TSPI for dismounted personnel, vehicles, small UAS, micro UAS, and wide-area weapons (e.g., joint fires, grenades, mortars, mines) in operational urban test environments to assess RTCA.  Current RTCA systems for urban operations include the use of laser tagging systems, paint-ball tagging, wide area munitions effects (e.g., RF-signal, simulation-based assessments), and subjective judgments (e.g., controller evaluations).  Laser tagging systems have many shortcomings, including dependence on position/functioning of laser sensors and the inability of lasers to shoot through smoke, paper, tent material, thin walls, etc.  Requirements for TSPI include:<BR>"Locations of individuals for assessing the effects of wide area weapons (e.g., joint fires, grenades, mortars, IEDs) requires less accuracy than for dismounted personnel, depending on the application.  (Position Accuracy +/- less than 0.25 m)<BR>"Locations of dismounted personnel (friendly, threat, and civilian) must be reported so they are accurately identified within a room/building, when they are indoors, and not partially in a wall or on the wrong side of a wall.  Also greater accuracy/precision will be needed to identify a persons location when he is leaning against a wall or in a prone position on the floor. (Position Accuracy +/- less than 0.15 m)<BR>"The orientation of each player (standing, kneeling, crawling, facing in which direction, etc.) is needed.

<DESC>The Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA intends to enter into a sole source contract with Landauer, Inc., 2 Science Road, Glenwood, IL 60425.  Landauer will furnish various monthly radiation exposure monitors (Luxel) as well as reports needed for measuring each employee's exposure levels for the Radiation Safety Office.  Due to the unique capabilities of the Landauer radiation exposure monitors, Landauer has been identified as the only company capable of fulfilling the Government's needs.  These monitors use Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) technology in radiation detection.  The detector material, which consists of aluminum oxide crystals is grown by Landauer and can measure exposure doses as low as 1 mrem.  This low dose is important to accurately quantify an employee's exposure to radiation.  Landauer also offers the METER tracking program which tracks exposures of employees who are working simultaneously at another institution as well as the VA in Philadelphia.  This announcement constitutes the only notice issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302, only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Vendors offering monitors including all features listed above and comparable to the Landauer, Inc. monitors are invited to respond to this notice by supplying descriptive information about their monitors to the designated Contract Specialist not later than 4:00 p.m. (local time) on December 15, 2008.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS TO ADVERTISE A SOLICITATION THAT IS READY FOR RELEASE, rather the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to (a) determine whether there are a sufficient number of responsible sources and (b) conduct market research regarding a potential five-year, Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the capability to provide Analytical Support For Automatic Identification System (AIS) Technologies. It is estimated that 14,500 of labor hours per year will be required.  It is anticipated that 90% of the work will be on-site in New London, CT.  With regard to this potential five-year contract, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (R&DC) is seeking information on companies that have the capability to detect, analyze, and document Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL) signal performance and interference issues; perform analysis of AIS vessel traffic data to support deepwater port risk assessments for proposed Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) terminal sites; apply the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 0183 v4.00 Interface Standard for AIS Shore Networks, including use of the NMEA 0183 v4.00 Transport Annotate and Group (TAG) Block methodologies; administer SUSE Enterprise Servers, Mail Servers, Mail List Servers, Web Servers, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Servers; develop complex Mathworks MATLAB models and solutions; to develop sophisticated automated analysis and web publishing applications for unattended operation, without intervention, running continuously 24x7, and the capability to develop and implement real-time research network capabilities and network applications for multiple platforms in both Java and C++ on Windows, Linux, and Apple operating systems.

Of critical importance is the capability to understand the AIS development and architecture in order to modify, and efficiently adapt existing real-time AIS research network and its components; to study and publish AIS reception site performance and AIS reception network operation; to perform real-time and historical AIS data processing and analyses directly applicable to supporting vessel incident investigations; to analyze and produce key data elements describing vessel traffic patterns, including volume and frequency of voyages near a deepwater port LNG site, and associated impact energy (kinetic force generated in the event of an allision/collision) for all vessel traffic, based upon 12 months of prerecorded AIS data; to administer automated system and data backups across the USCG R&DC AIS research network; to maintain an AIS multi-year data repository; to perform System Operation Center functions for, and research client management within, the R&DC AIS research network; to extend and operate the USCG R&DC AIS VDL performance simulation; to extend the existing R&DC AIS research network; and to support advanced AIS reception research.

Responses to this market research shall include the following:  (1) Describe company experience or history of the past three years and how your experience was obtained or developed relevant to the scope of this RFI including your business size status under NAICS Code 541511 (limit 3 pages); and (2) Describe the current capabilities that you have to meet the tasking requirements described in this RFI (limit 3 pages).  Again, the only purpose of this RFI is to collect market research information.  This announcement is not a research or development project.  The purpose of this announcement is NOT to develop or evaluate potential new products, services or facilities, or to improve existing facilities for the purpose of meeting the specific performance capabilities or objectives. At this stage, the Government has no intention to further develop or produce any equipment from the information received.  Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the USCG.  Responses to this market survey shall be sent directly to: Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil with a copy to Lee.A.Luft@uscg.mil.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later than 22 December 2008.  NOTE:  Proposals are not being solicited at this time. PHONE CALLS MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED, VOICEMAIL MESSAGES WILL NOT BE RETURNED, MAIL AND EMAILS RECEIVED WILL NOT BE RESPONDED TO.

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Mechanical Pencils and Refills by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2021 PENCIL, MECHANICAL Silver and Red with a 12 lead &amp; eraser cassette that holds .5 MM HB lead; 2 pencils per package</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2022 PENCIL, MECHANICAL Silver and Blue with a 12 lead &amp; eraser cassette that holds .7 MM HB lead; 2 pencils per package</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0875 Refill, 12 Lead Cartridge, 0.5mm HB, plus one eraser, 2 cartridges per package</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0876 Refill, 12 Lead Cartridge, 0.7mm HB, plus one eraser, 2 cartridges per package</p>
<p><br />The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Mechanical Pencils and Refills to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2021 PAP-35842<br />7520-00-NIB-2022 PAP-35843<br />7510-00-NIB-0875 PAP-64761<br />7510-00-NIB-0876 PAP-64767</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 17, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) announces an open season to restructure existing teams for all domains under the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) program.  EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel).  These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support.  The complete scope of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below.  Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the EXPRESS domains as follows:  Business & Analytical  3 each, Logistics  3 each, Programmatic  4 each, and Technical  6 each.  The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams.  The purpose of the current open season will allow the existing EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders to restructure existing teams by adding new team members and subcontractors, deleting current team members and subcontractors, changing current subcontractors to team members, changing current team members to subcontractors, and/or revising teaming arrangement(s) to respond to future EXPRESS task order requirements.  Parties interested in participating as a team member (GSA Schedule required), subcontractor (no GSA Schedule required) or providing incidental materials (GSA Schedule preferred), are encouraged to pursue appropriate arrangements with the current EXPRESS Prime Contractor/Team Leaders.  A list of the current EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders may be found on the EXPRESS website located at https://redstoneappsrv1.redstone.army.mil/acweb/acwebdba.acweb_home_child?p_link_id=83.    This website also contains a link to each BPA teams website for additional information.  To restructure teaming relationships on existing BPAs, Prime Contractors/Team Leaders are required to submit one hard copy and one CD-ROM containing the following information:  A team matrix that identifies added/deleted team members/subcontractors; a revised Attachment 4 (Team File) to include rates through 2014; and an updated RFQ Attachment 9 (Performance Capability Team File).  The format for the Team matrix will be provided via email.  Formats for Attachments 4 and 9 can be found on the EXPRESS website under the Open Season link.  Responses from the current prime/team leaders to this open season announcement are due no later than 1400  (CST) on 8 January 2009 to the following address:  COMMANDER, U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSCC-AVM-OS-O/Terri Adams, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.<BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The U S Army Corps of Engineers has been pilot testing a biotechnology known as the periphyton stormwater treatment area to achieve greater phosphorus reduction.  The STA-1E Demonstration Project includes operating Cells 1 and 2 at differing hydraulic loading rates and differing hydraulic retention times in differing types of substrate.

Additional 3 years of design services and monitoring for full scale implementation will be necessary.  The full duration of this contract is envisioned to last 5 years.  Evaluation of design parameters, operational parameters, and recommendations for full-scale implementation of PSTA for STA-1E is a requirement of this project.

The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the low offer and/or make no award at all.
<p>This posting is to inform potential providers that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (R&amp;IE) has a requirement for maintenance and repair of the Heating and Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system for a Gravimetric Laboratory.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Technical Capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROJECT OFFICER

To be disclosed at time of award.

(viii)   The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in the this solicitation.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An Unacceptable score means that the offer did not meet the minimum requirements and as a result, will not be considered for award.

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance. 

PRICE:

The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2008).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

	Mid-level management assignments,

	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.

(Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches).  A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized.  If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3   End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material.

4.7.4.4   The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5   If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5   Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2   When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).
o	Contract/Task Order number.

o	Period of contract performance.
o	Description of work performed.	

1.2.3	Recording Method  The Contractor must clearly identify the contractors type of 			recording method and/or equipment that will be used for both grand jury and 			depositions.  Failure to provide this information could affect the contractors 			ability to receive a contract award. 

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A BRAND NAME REQUIREMENT. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES ARE INVITED TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE WHICH WILL RECEIVE AWARD CONSIDERATION.
<p>TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for ensuring that TRICARE program policy is based on current evidence, is responsive to changes in the standard of care in the United States, and complies with the laws and regulations governing TRICARE.</p>
<p>&bull; TMA is tasked with developing program policy that allows beneficiaries access to new and emerging treatment but does not expose them to untested, unsafe or ineffective (unproven) treatment which is specifically excluded from coverage by TRICARE regulation.</p>
<p>&bull; TRICARE regulation and policy mandate that in making determinations on whether drugs, devices, medical treatments and procedures are proven to be safe, effective, and the standard of care, and eligible for coverage, TRICARE must use the TRICARE Hierarchy of Reliable Evidence as defined in 32 CFR 199.2 and 32 CFR 199.49g)(15).</p>
<p>o One of the elements of this Hierarchy is published formal technology assessments.<br />o In order to fulfill these requirements, TMA must have immediate access to medical technology assessments/reports which address the full range of healthcare technology including medical and surgical procedures, drugs, diagnostic and screening tests, and medical devices.<br />o In order for TRICARE to make timely, sound, objective, evidenced-based benefit determinations, these assessments/reports must include the most up-to-date medical evidence, a description of the technology at issue, a description and analysis of the strength/quality of the scientific evidence regarding efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes, patient selection criteria, comparison with alternative technologies and a clear, concise, consistent, easily understandable, well-recognized and accepted method to rate the safety and efficacy of the healthcare technology and provide an overall rating on whether the technology is of established (proven) benefit or is of unproven benefit.<br />o This assessment/report must be easy to comprehend by lay persons and medical experts.<br />o TMA needs access to evidence-based reports with quick turnarounds to support decisions on urgent, expedited cases and to keep current with the rapid and extensive changes in the standard of care.<br />o In order to ensure that TRICARE program policy is based on the most current scientific evidence, these assessments/reports must be periodically updated.<br />o Given the extensive and rapid development of healthcare technologies, some of these technologies will have limited published evidence. In order to evaluate these new and emerging healthcare technologies, TRICARE needs access to a wide range of medical technology reports which evaluate the available evidence and which keeps TRICARE up-to-date on the newest technologies under development.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Hayes Medical Technology Directory</p>
<p>o The Directory consists of over 350 comprehensive, evidence-based technology assessment reports on a wide range of healthcare technologies including medical and surgical procedures, drugs and pharmaceuticals, diagnostic and screening tests, alternative therapies, and medical devices/equipment. Access to approximately 80 updated or new health technology evaluations per year.<br />o The Directory provides a compendium of over 350 technology assessments on a wide-range of topics with approximately 80-90 new and updated assessments added per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Hayes Health Technology Brief Service</p>
<p>o The Hayes Health Technology Brief Service includes access to Hayes Search &amp; Summary which provides expedited reports with delivery in 3 to 5 business days of request.<br />o The Hayes Health Technology Brief assesses new technologies for which there is some published evidence but not enough for a comprehensive assessment.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

The unique nature of the Transition Initiatives (TI) program poses unique challenges for the recruitment, training and retention of staff.  OTI operates outside the development-mold, working with countries in post-conflict transition toward the social and political stability essential for the successful implementation of development activities.  Many of the Agencys development-oriented training programs are not well-suited to providing the kinds of professional training needed in OTI.  The transitory nature of OTIs programs often result in recruitment of staff using a personal services contract (PSC) mechanism, bringing in staff who have never worked for the Federal government before.  Many of the Agencys administrative and operational training programs assume a level of exposure to, and knowledge of, government operations well above the level of many OTI recruits.  This situation compels OTI to develop and conduct more in-house training than is the norm in other Agency Bureaus.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The Training Specialist will assess OTIs training needs to identify where Agency, Federal, or commercial training is available to meet those needs, and to design and implement training programs where other sources are inadequate or unable to meet those needs.  Key training programs to be developed in-house are those involving activities and programs that are unique to OTI, such as staff orientation and specialized training for Program Managers, Country field staff, and regional team leaders.  The Training Advisor will collaborate with the OTI Program Office and the OTI Field Programs Division to ensure that training modules developed are responsive to staff needs, sensitive to the OTI culture, and updated on an ongoing basis to incorporate lessons learned from hands-on headquarters and field experience.

OBJECTIVE

To hire a Training Specialist to support OTI's training needs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Chief, Operations and Management Division or his/her designee, the Training Specialist will perform the following duties:

(1)  Design training sessions on activities specific to OTI, such as orientation and the performance of functions unique to OTI (program management as performed by Program Managers, field implementation as performed by Country Representatives and Deputy Country Representatives, program oversight as performed by Regional Team Leaders, etc.).  Training modules will be developed in close collaboration with targeted participants, their supervisors, and their managers.  Training modules will be reviewed frequently and updated to reflect lessons learned from hands-on headquarters and field experience.  Most of this training will be Washington-based, but some field training may be required (such as regional training for FSN staff).   Deliver OTI-specific training as required, to include scheduling sessions, providing logistical support, scheduling travel and transportation for trainers and participants, and coaching presenters when necessary or appropriate. 

(2)  Develop, coordinate and manage an OTI training plan, to include 

	overseeing the development of supervisor-approved individual development plans (IDPs) for all OTI employees, to be reviewed and updated annually by the employees and their supervisors;
	analyzing the training needs identified in the IDPs to identify appropriate approaches to meeting these needs;
	maintaining a database of training needed and completed for all employees, and providing a variety of database training reports to management when required;
	monitoring training opportunities offered by sources outside OTI, to identify opportunities for employee participation in external training programs;
	reviewing individual requests for training, to ensure that training resources are allocated equitably and in accordance with office training priorities; 
	ensuring that personnel files (both paper and electronic) include documentation of all training completed; and 
	keeping OTIs Senior Leadership Team informed on a regular basis concerning implementation and costs of the training program.

(3)  Serve as OTIs training expert by:

	advising individual employees, their supervisors, and office managers on all aspects of employee development; 
	monitoring Agency, Bureau and Office training policies and procedures to determine applicability to OTI; 
	developing and maintaining a library of training resources, job aids and on-line materials to enhance employee performance; and
	providing assistance in identifying external training-related resources, including facilitation services where requested;
	representing the Office by participating in Agency, Bureau, or other training coordination efforts as required by the supervisor.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Training Specialist will take direction from and will report to OTIs Chief of Operations and Management or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region.  The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.  The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. 

The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program supports the Government of Pakistans development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  The FTI engages the Government of Pakistans FS and Political Agents as well as the FATAs tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the regions most immediate needs.  The FS and its representative Agency structures constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program.  The FTI effort requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

The USAID Office of Transition Initiatives Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general and of the sub-region in particular.  Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including, but not limited to, community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights.  Excellent inter-personal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary.  Experience in contract/grant oversight is required.  Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and management of program operations in a conflict environment is preferred. 

The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.  It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff performance and morale in a difficult work environment.  Strong team-building skills are essential.

The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTIs mission and global programs to in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.

The Country Representatives principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program in FATA.  Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.  Depending on the situation, USG-provided housing in Peshawar may be shared with one other permanent USAID/OTI field staff. 

The Country Representative will:

	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, Government of Pakistan Officials, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;

	Serve as OTIs primary liaison with USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other relevant agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with these varied stakeholders in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;

	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the USAID Mission and U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and USG personnel in Peshawar, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, various USG entities, and other donor organizations;

	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of field-based OTI staff;

	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTIs implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) to ensure that activities are contributing to OTIs program objectives and are within the partners scope;

	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partners scope to OTIs country objectives, partners budgets, and modifications thereto;

	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS;

	Ensure that OTIs programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;

	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;

	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government, as appropriate;

	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the USG personnel in Pakistan, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate. 

If required, travel to other or potential OTI field locations and/or Washington, DC to provide consultations on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

rates per hour for emergency situations. Technical capability is more important
when compared to price. The importance of price will increase if offeror&rsquo;s'
technical factor is considered essentially equal. The evaluation will assess
the adequacy of the Offeror&rsquo;s approach to responding to emergency situations.
No merit points will be issued. Options. All options must be priced. The
Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price
for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government
may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are
significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the
Government to exercise the option(s). A written notice of award or acceptance
of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the
time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract
without further action by either party. Before the offer&rsquo;s specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not
there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal
is received before award.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers related to this solicitation:

1) Clarification is required on the due date for this requirement. Fedbizopps has Dec 5 @ 4PM as the due date and the solicitation has Dec 4 @4pm.  Please clarify.   

Answer: Due date for receipt of proposals is December 5, 2008 at 4 p.m. EST.  

2) Question: Would offerors have to have breakers in addition to the breakers provided by the NRC?  If  additional breakers are needed in addition to the breakers provided by the NRC , how many of each would be required?

Answer: Section B.3.3. of the solicitation states the type of circuit breakers that the NRC will provide as part of this requirement.  These breakers may be dismantled and rebuilt during the courses, but they must remain functional for the next course (i.e., they cannot be damaged or altered).  If an adequate course can be conducted with these four breakers, then the offerors can state as such.  However, if the offerors feel additional breakers would need to be acquired (whether medium voltage or otherwise), they must furnish them or provide ample justification for additional NRC purchases-- this course must be able to accommodate 17 students.  Additionally, it is expected the breakers (and cubicle) will remain at the contractors facility between courses (shipping these breakers is very expensive and labor intensive).  The facilities would include all testing equipment necessary to adequately demonstrate the functionality of the breakers, as well as the required equipment to show proper, accepted maintenance and testing protocols.

3). Is the electronic version required in addition to the hard copy or will the electronic be sufficient?  

Answer:  An electronic version (via email) is required in addition to the hard copies.  The proposals must be emailed to kala.shankar@nrc.gov by the due date and time specified in this amendment.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>ANSWERS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FOR<BR>W91WAW-08-R-0146 Court Reporting and Transcription Services<BR><BR><BR>(Q)1.  If the work is to be performed at the contractor's facility, we assume that you are looking for court reporters/transcribers of recorded audio proceedings?<BR> <BR>Could you explain the process?<BR> <BR>(A)	The contractor will supply court reporters and all equipment necessary to provide verbatim reporting of ASBCA proceedings, which are held world-wide.  The contractor will then provide verbatim transcripts of the reported ASBCA proceedings. <BR><BR><BR>(Q)2.   We I noticed in the solicitation on page 20 of 77 under security requirements that the Contractor is required to have a SECRET clearance granted by the Defense Security Service (DSS) at time of proposal submission.  I would like to note that this severely limits open competition.  <BR>	 <BR>	We have several clearances from various Government agencies but not a Secret DSS clearance.  Does this mean that would be excluded from bidding on the ASBCA solicitiation?<BR><BR>(A) Contractor and subcontractor personnel who will be involved in processing classified information shall have current U.S. SECRET security clearances.  The personnel security clearances do not have to be issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office or by the Defense Security Service. <BR> <BR><BR>Contractor or, if Contractor subcontracts the processing of classified information, its subcontractor shall have a SECRET facility clearance granted by the Defense Security Service.  <BR><BR><BR>(Q)3.	I am in receipt of the above-referenced solicitation.  Can you clarify the location the services are to be held, please?  The solicitation indicates Washington, DC and I am unclear if that is where the services are to be held or just the office which is seeking the bid for another area.   I am in eastern NC and would not bid on a contract in the DC area.  I will await your reply.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(A)	The Contractor will supply court reporters and all equipment necessary to provide verbatim reporting of ASBCA proceedings, which are held world-wide.  The Contractor will then provide verbatim transcripts of the reported ASBCA proceedings.   <BR>

<DESC>Clarifications for Announcement  N6000090100
Please note that this is not a Request for Proposals.  This is a notice of the opportunity to submit Standard Form 330 for evaluation for consideration of award for a contract for Architect and Engineering Services.  Please submit a letter of interest and the SF330.  A solicitation will follow the evaluation of the responses to this request.  Firms will be notified of their inclusion on a short list.
Q.  What is the difference between the announcements N6000090100 and N6000090200?A.  The ONLY difference between these two announcements is that N6000090100 is 100% Set Aside for Small Business and N6000090200 is open to all competition both small and large business under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.
Q.  When is the response due?A.  Responses are due January 6, 2009.
Q.  Can we reply alone as an individual architectural firm, or should we gather professionals from the other disciplines needed and apply as a team?A.  The Standard Form 330 must demonstrate the ability of the respondent to meet, individually or as a team , ALL of the requirements noted under the description of services.
Q.  How do I access Numbered Note 24?A.  Go to http://www.fbodaily.com/fbo/notes.html
Q.  How can I get the Standard Form 330?A.  The SF330 in WORD format is available at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?viewType=DETAIL&formId=21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6
Q. Is this a readvertisement of a current contract?A.  Yes.  The incumbent contractors are:	Ratio Architects, Inc., 107 S. Pennsylvania St., Suite 100, Indianapolis, IN 46204	Bahr Vermeer Haecker Architects, Ltd, 440 N 8th Street, Ste 100, Lincoln, NE 68508	Quinn Evans Architects, 219  N. Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
Q.  Is it in the best interest of a small business to respond to both of these notices?A.  Small businesses may submit under both notices.  You must submit a separate package for each notice.
Q.  Is there a bidders' list?A.  There is no bidders list associated with this notice. 
Q.  Realistically speaking, how many projects will occur during the course of 1 year, and what would be the ideal size of the firm you would select.A.  The Government cannot predict the number or size of requirements we may have under these contracts.  In the past we have selected firms of varying sizes, however, respondents must have all the required disciplines either in house or by teaming with other firms.
Q.  Will forms other than the Standard Form 330 be acceptable?A.  No.
Q.  Can a small business as prime add large firms as sub-consultants to cover specialty disciplines and geographic coverage and still meet the 100% Small Business Set Aside?  A.   Yes, however, the small business must be prepared to perform at least 50% of the work required under the contract.  A large portion of the work under this contract will be related to historic properties i.e. studies and construction documents for rehabilitation, restoration of those properties and other historic studies of landscapes and buildings which are not related to construction.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks in the Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David L. Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Complexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.  AIT Complexes are designed as training facilities.  AIT Complexes will be programmed as a unit, rather than as individual facilities as the complete battalion drives the overall functionality of the facility.  Included are functional, operational, and spatial relationships critical to meeting battalion training requirements which are embedded in the operational layout of the facilities.  All facility types will meet DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, latest edition.<BR><BR>The BCOF is comprised of sleeping, latrine, classrooms, storage, and company operations components.  As the BCOF is designed for able-bodied soldiers, the facility is not required to meet ADA compliance.  Each two-person living suite has a minimum population of two and may be increased to a maximum population of three to accommodate population surges.<BR><BR>The DFAC is will be procured through Norfolk District contracts. <BR><BR>The BN HQ facility will be procured through the Fort Worth District under separate solicitation action.<BR><BR>The AIT Site includes Outside Areas such as; a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service access drives and parking areas.  Exterior lighting shall be provided for parking areas, side walks, interconnecting buildings, service yards, service drives, outdoor training areas, and any required security lighting.

BT complexes are comprised of Barracks / Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facility (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), and Lawn Equipment Storage Buildings (LEB).  <BR><BR>The BCOF is comprised of sleeping, latrine, classrooms, storage, and company operations components.  The BCOF is designed for able-bodied soldiers and is not required to meet ADA compliance.  Each two-person living suite has a minimum population of two and may be increased to a maximum population of three to accommodate population surges.<BR><BR>The DFAC will be procured through Norfolk District contracts. <BR><BR>The BN HQ facility will be procured through the Fort Worth District under separate solicitation action.<BR><BR>Lawn Equipment Storage Buildings (LEB) will provide adequate storage for maintenance equipment and materials used in the grounds-keeping and care of the BT site.  The LEBs will prevent unauthorized access and protect maintenance equipment from outdoor elements, including rain and snow.  <BR><BR>Basic Training facility includes Outside Areas, including a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service access drives and parking areas.  Exterior lighting shall be provided for parking areas, side walks, interconnecting buildings, service yards, service drives, outdoor training areas, and any required security lighting.  Parking shall be provided for BN HQ staff, Company Cadre within BCOF, DFAC staff, government and service vehicles and visitors.  PT Pits will be located in close proximity of the BCOF it serves.<BR><BR>Warriors in Transition Facilities:<BR>The WIT facilities will house soldiers temporarily while they are recuperating from injuries sustained during their service in the United States and overseas fighting the Global War on Terror (GWoT).  These facilities will provide the best accommodations the Army can build in gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  The WIT Complexes will include separate barracks, administrative and Soldier Family Assistance Centers (SFAC) and are completely handicap accessible.  <BR><BR>The barracks will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.

A living room, laundry and full service kitchen shall be shared by the room module occupants.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  <BR><BR>The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries.  Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility.   <BR><BR>All of the WIT facilities together form a complex and provides a cohesive mission in the healing process of the soldier.  The Government reserves the right to solicit this facility type separately, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government, through approval of an amendment to the acquisition plan.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.  <BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are approximately equal to price.  <BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 12 Dec 08 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0009.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 12 Jan 09.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31 Million.  This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted.     <BR><BR>MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $499,500,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $75,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 70.0%; Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%; HUBZone Small Business 9.8%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.0%; and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 0.9%.

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH):<BR><BR>UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.
