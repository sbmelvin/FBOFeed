<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.
CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for architectural and engineering design services and anticipates the award of a firm fixed price contract to the most highly qualified firm as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation.   
PROJECT INFORMATION:   In 1960, Congress enacted Public Law 86-488 authorizing construction of the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project (CVP). A part of San Luis Unit Act was a provision to provide drainage systems. Over the past several decades, Reclamation has formulated different strategies to provide drainage the service to the San Luis Unit (SLU) of the CVP. In the 1960's, it was determined that the best method of providing drainage to the SLU was to construct a 197 mile drain that would convey drainage to the San Francisco Bay-Delta.  By 1975, 82 miles of the drain were completed and the project was suspended due to issues regarding authorization, funding, and selection of a final discharge point. The Kesterson Reservoir was the temporary terminus of the uncompleted drain. By 1978, lands within Westlands Water District had begun draining an average of 7,300 acre-feet of water annually to the drain. In 1986, both the Kesterson Reservoir and the drains at Westlands Water District were closed because of the environmental impacts attributed to selenium present in the drainage water. The water deliveries to the Westlands Water District continued, however, and there has been no direct outlet for drainage water from Westlands Water District since that time. Lands in and adjacent to the SLU north of Westlands have historically discharged drainage water to the San Joaquin River and continue to do so, with increasingly stringent discharge limits, under the Grassland Bypass Project.
The Department of Interior was subsequently sued by affected landowners and water districts within and nearby the SLU service area for not providing drainage service. In 2000, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled substantially in favor of the Plaintiffs, and the District Court subsequently ordered the Government to, without delay, provide drainage to the SLU pursuant to the statutory duty imposed by section 1(a) of the San Luis Act.  Reclamation responded to this Order by preparing a Plan of Action in 2001 to provide drainage service to the SLU. The Plan of Action was followed by completion of a Plan Formulation Report in 2002 that identified an In-Valley disposal and drainage water treatment alternative as the preferred plan for providing drainage service.
Reclamation evaluated a variety of treatment and disposal technologies for agricultural drainage during 2003 - 2006, including laboratory bench-, and field pilot-tests.  Based upon the results of these tests, Reclamation developed an overall treatment process that consists of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, proprietary selenium biotreatment followed by evaporation ponds.  The RO separates 99% of the dissolved salts and selenium from the agricultural drainage into a concentrated waste stream.  The concentrated waste stream then flows through the biotreatment, which removes about 99% of the selenium to a concentration below 0.010 mg/L.  The treated effluent from the biotreatment is then discharged to evaporation ponds and subsequently buried in place for final disposal.  The selenium solids removed by the biotreatment system are transported by truck to a landfill.
 Reclamation issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in 2007, which selected a drainage alternative based upon the RO and biotreatment process.  Reclamation is now proceeding with implementation of the ROD in accordance with a court order issued in December 2009, and requires engineering services to assist with the preparation of final designs, specifications, and cost estimates for a Demonstration Treatment Plant (Plant) to be constructed in 2012 in the Panoche Drainage District within the SLU.  The primary purpose of the Plant is to demonstrate and operate the RO and biotreatment systems to collect cost and performance data required for the final design of several full-scale drainage treatment facilities to be constructed across the SLU in the future.  
SCOPE AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  
1.  The Contractor shall prepare complete designs and specifications, suitable for subsequent supply/construction, of RO and  biological water treatment equipment to meet the following performance requirements:
	1.1  Equipment shall be capable of 24-hour per day, 7 days per week, year-round operations for treatment of re-used agricultural drainage water supplied by Reclamation from seven sumps, via pipeline, and blended within a 500,000 gallon equalization tank also supplied by Reclamation.
	1.2  RO treatment capacity shall be 200 gallons per minute (gpm) of raw drainage inflow.  Treatment capacity shall be provided using two parallel 100-gpm RO skids.  Relevant influent drainage water quality parameters are provided in Exhibit 1, and include:
              -Total dissolved solids: 9,000 - 12,000 mg/L              -Dissolved selenium:  0.4 - 0.6 mg/L
	1.3  RO treatment design and specifications shall include any pretreatment operations required to consistently achieve: 
                -A Silt Density Index of 3.0., or lower, using the standard test method from ASTM D4189-07.                -Minimum 50% RO product water recovery.                  -Prevention of biofouling and scaling of the RO membranes.                -Maximum RO membrane cleaning frequency: quarterly.
	1.4  RO treatment equipment and membranes shall be capable of 98 - 99% rejection of total dissolved salts, including selenium ions.
	1.5  The biotreatment system shall treat the concentrated waste stream from the RO treatment system and have a minimum inflow capacity of 100-gpm minute.  Biotreatment capacity shall be sufficient to treat the entire concentrated waste stream flow from the RO treatment system.  Biotreatment capacity shall be provided using two parallel bioreactor trains with nutrient dosing systems.  Expected water quality parameters of RO concentrate that flows into the biotreatment system include:
                -Total dissolved solids:  18,000 - 24,000 mg/L                -Dissolved selenium: 0.8 - 1.2 mg/L                -Nitrate: 300 - 340 mg/L
	1.6  Concentration of total selenium in the treated effluent from the biotreatment system shall not exceed 0.010 mg/L.
	1.7  The biotreatment system shall include any post-treatment oxidation operations required to convert organic selenium species in the treated effluent to inorganic selenium species.  
2.  The Contractor shall provide a written warranty for the RO and  design and specifications that guarantees the following treatment performance:  
               -Minimum 50% RO product water recovery               -Maximum total selenium concentration in the  treated effluent shall be 0.010 mg/L               -The concentrations of organic selenium species in the treated effluent shall be less than the                                   concentrations of organic selenium species in the influent untreated drainage.
3.  The RO and design and specifications shall include any equipment required for backwashing of the RO pretreatment and biotreatment systems and a clean-in-place skid to clean the RO membranes.
4.  The RO and biotreatment design and specifications shall include any intermediate equalization or storage tanks and pumps required between the pretreatment, RO, biotreatment and post-treatment operations.

This market survey advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.1
BACKGROUND
The Flight Standards System Quality Assurance Staff (AFS-40) is an independent AFS headquarters organization established for the purpose of validating the effectiveness of core systems and processes within the Flight Standards Service.  This is accomplished by conducting audits and analyzing the audit results.  AFS-40 audit results are provided directly to the Director of Flight Standards Service and are used as a basis for making strategic and tactical decisions with regard to Flight Standards Service's major systems and processes.  Many of these audit activities require intense inspector preparation and involvement.  To add to this workload, AFS-40 is also as the focal point for maintaining the AFS ISO 9001:2000 registration in support of AVS - ISO registration.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to three additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
 Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).
 Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
 The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.
 This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission date of January 13, 2011 and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ Districts); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.
  Joint Venture/Mentor Protg firms are not allowed.  TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. After carefully reviewing the submittal requirements checklist to ensure compliance, please submit your package to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Laurel Colon, Code RAQ20, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, or via email to laurel.colon@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on January 13, 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI). It is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals"). FAR 11.101 ("Order of precedence for requirements documents") requires agencies to develop requirements documents to meet agency needs that utilize performance-oriented documents based on voluntary industry consensus standards to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>

Statement of Work

Background
The Director of NIH has established an Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Center in its Intramural Research Program. This center will be administered by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Investigators from all appropriate ICs will learn to generate IPSCs and investigate their biology and potential therapeutic uses. The mission is to bring this exciting new technology to clinical reality within the NIH Intramural Research Program and the NIH Clinical Center. The Center will be expected to conduct world class research that will catalyze new approaches and uses of IPSCs and differentiated cells derived from them, and/or cells trans-differentiated from somatic cells for the entire biomedical research community. The IPSC Center will promote the use of this technology and provide researchers with training to facilitate clinical development of IPSCs.

The objective is to train 20 investigators in the derivation of human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS) and provide training in generating, maintaining and storing human IPS cell lines. Instructors will provide "state of the art" information on reprogramming somatic cells to become pluripotent.

The NIH needs to train investigators how to generate human iPS cells and is seeking a company with proven experience in iPS cell generation and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful iPS cell generation.

Contractor Requirements
The services to be provided under this order shall include the following:

- Conduct training in December 2010 to instruct 20 IRP scientists in how to generate and culture human iPSCs. A total of 4 instructors are needed to teach the course, providing a high level of individual instruction over a 3 day period.

- The course will include didactic information and "hands on" experience in making iPS cells for students who may have little to no experience in stem cell technology. The company will provide tested reagents that effectively and reproducibly mediate generation of human iPS cells, as well as appropriate consumables.

Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the attached draft statement of work.

<DESC>Source Sought Notice
Private Provider Network

Introduction

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

This is strictly market research, therefore no questions regarding this market research will be entertained.

Background

PSC is the shared-services provider for HHS. Created in 1995 to reduce duplication in federal administrative support services, PSC provides support services to the department, its component agencies, and other federal agencies on a competitive fee-for-service basis, allowing the agencies to focus on their core missions. Support services include administrative operations, financial management, human resources, strategic acquisition, and federal occupational health. 

FOH, a division of the Program Support Center and a component of Health and Human Services, works in partnership with Federal organizations throughout the US and its territories to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to meet their occupational safety and health promotion needs.

The Program Support Center (PSC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) wants to identify viable small businesses that can provide a nationwide network of private providers (PPN) of occupational health medical services for the Federal Occupational Health Service (FOH).  The PPN service requests will include medical surveillance exams, pre-placement physicals, collection of various laboratory specimens, immunizations, annual medical screenings, post-exposure exams, phlebotomy services, and blood pressure checks, in addition to a variety of additional health and wellness procedures and examinations.   More than 16,000 exams and over 80,000 additional OH services were completed by the FOH PPN last year.
 
The PPN will require one centralized location to manage the process of receiving the services requests, assigning the private provider to be used, collecting the results and making the medical record, quality review of the service and results, scheduling of certain exams and shipping of the completed medical record to the designated location.  This centralized location will store all the medical records for the FOH PPN program and will retrieve records and ship to designated location as requested.  The system for communicating and managing the network will be a contractor-provided online secured web-based portal where information on status and results will be available to designated FOH staff.  

The PPN supports FOHs mission and objectives to improve the health and safety of the government workforce. This PPN will enhance the reach of FOH programs offered to its interagency partners by providing FOHs services in remote areas where FOH does not have an Occupational Health Clinic.  The PPN will support FOHs ability to provide high quality occupational health medical services to the Federal government.  

Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a network of private providers of occupational health medical services nationwide.  Firms are required to have professional and technical expertise in providing a network of occupational health medical services nationwide utilizing a centralized management and quality review process that provides FOH access to a secure on-line website data system. The goal is to provide consistent standardized occupational health services in areas where FOH does not have a current presence in an efficient manner such that Federal employees do not have to travel long distances to receive services, thus saving taxpayer dollars.

The contractor shall provide private provider services within the Continental United States (CONUS), as well as outside of the United States (OCONUS), to include the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska, and international locations including Canada. Additional international sites may also be required, if the need for such services may arise. These service provisions are performed through a variety of health and wellness service facilities. Hospitals, occupational health clinics, general medical clinics, specialty and other types of medical providers may be required. Typically around 2000 sites have been used each year, but as many as 5000 might be needed during peak utilization.  Outreach services may be conducted using mobile vans and outreach medical staff. The contractor shall distribute the necessary forms, documents, and supplies to all private providers, as specified by FOH, to successfully perform the required services. The contractor shall receive and process the completed clinical documentation from the private providers and shall review all materials for completeness, adequacy of testing and accuracy according to components and instructions on the work order and/or as specified in FOH Clinical Policies and Procedures. All testing and services should meet United States occupational health industry standards. The contractor will assist FOH in assessing the quality, timeliness and accuracy of services through standard as well as innovative continuous quality improvement techniques.



Project Requirements

The contractor shall administer and manage the private provider network. This requirement includes the location and procurement of services from a network of private providers in designated locations who meet FOH Occupational Health services requirements.

The contractor will also prepare and ship FOH provided laboratory kits and examination packets to private providers. The kits will include instructions on laboratory testing and examination and testing requirements, including the requirements of specified form completion. The contractor will also prepare and ship vaccines, if indicated. Shipment of vaccine should meet or exceed CDC requirements for vaccine shipment. The contractor will monitor and manage the private clinic performance. If the clinic is not able to complete the requirements of the work order request adequately, the contractor may be requested by FOH to complete a corrective action plan and present it to the COTR. The contractor will also maintain and ship medical records to specified locations as identified in the work order or recipient plan.   The contractor shall provide a single toll-free number to be distributed to FOH staff. The toll-free number must be staffed from 7:00AM to 7:00PM Central Standard Time.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting market research to obtain information on responsible sources that have the capability to provide design/development assistance, prototyping production, and testing of a novel Tactical Emergency Release System (TERS) used on individual load bearing tactical equipment.  Generally, a TERS is needed to ensure a Marines ability to doff the tactical equipment (e.g. vest) in situations analogous to water submersion, ensnarement, or medical emergencies.  MCSC endeavors to enhance the current emergency don and doff performance of its existing individual load bearing tactical equipment.

Sample traits of the desired TERS may include:
Easy to Use: intuitive, activated by either hand, effective in all environments regardless of dress, no special tooling for field repair or field replacement of TERS
Durable: reusable, withstands high tension, withstands blunt impact, consistent effectiveness in multiple environments (e.g.
 high altitude, deep submersion, extreme heat/cold) 
Ergonomic: minimal weight, non-obtrusive, no pressure points, contours to body
Efficient: single point activation with complete release of equipment in two components, shared release points with routine doff process
Non Hazardous: no sharp edges, no magnetic interference, no infrared signature, no accidental misfire, non-explosive

MCSC is specifically seeking information from sources that have experience with related innovative design/development efforts and have experience with or access to rapid prototype production that includes injection molding, metal fabrication and integration of the prototype hardware into individual load bearing tactical equipment.

Interested sources should submit information related to relevant design/development capabilities and experience, as well as specific prototype production capabilities.
  Prototype production information should clearly state if the source has an organic production capability and its experience related to injection molding and metal fabrication.  Sources without organic production capability should include information about the likely production subcontractors experience.  Both organic and subcontracted prototype production information should include standard/estimated prototype production times.  Other relevant marketing and technical materials are welcome.  Small businesses are encouraged to respond. 

The Government anticipates a solicitation for this effort to be released during Fiscal Year 2011.  The likely resultant contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), thus Offerors must have an adequate accounting system in accordance with FAR 16.301-3 to be eligible for award.
  If contract award is made, MCSC will provide the baseline concept TERS for further development; the development process is envisioned to be an iterative design, build, and test process.  Individual load bearing tactical equipment will be provided to the contract awardee (if award is made) in the form of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). 

Clearly marked restricted or proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government.  The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.  All submitted materials will be retained by the Government and not returned to the sender.

Responses to this RFI are requested by 10 Dec 2010 to jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil, or Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Attn: Jennifer Glenn CT023, Quantico, VA 22134

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VAs requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VAs requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for development of a bi-directional interface between existing Methadone Maintenance Software and VISTA.
 
Background

Currently there are 48 methadone maintenance clinics within Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Thirty four (34) are VHA managed and fourteen (14) are contracted methadone services. VHA operated methadone maintenance clinics primarily use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software to dispense and document methadone administration. The manner in which this information is recorded and shared in the Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) varies across facilities. Inconsistencies in documenting methadone maintenance clinic medication orders and dispensing information within CPRS have resulted in increased patient safety vulnerabilities such as drug interactions, missed medications and lack of continuity of care. Medications that interact or are synergistic with methadone have been prescribed because the medical provider did not realize the Veteran was currently receiving methadone treatment. A Class I interface between the COTS software and CPRS is needed.

Requirements

Three HL-7 interfaces are needed:
 	Admission/Discharge
 	Prescriptions/Orders
 	Dispensing Services

A basic order needs to be sent from CPRS to the Methadone Maintenance System (MMS). Once the basic methadone order is in the MMS, dosing information (i.e. pick-up and take homes scheduling) will be added to the MMS.  A new order arrival alert for provider staff needs to be created to alert providers that a new order has arrived in the MMS.  This alert will instruct the staff to check the new order so that they can fill the order with the appropriate dosing schedule.  There will need to be an open order report created, listing all of the open orders. Once the dosing information is entered, this information will need to be sent back from the MMS into a CPRS/Vista patient specific progress note.  This capability will be part of a separate interface.

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 10 pages.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information via electronically (email) no later than Novembver19, 2010 at 4PM EST to VA Contracting Officer:  Marianne Pl LeBlanc, Senior Procurement Analyst, VISN 1 Contracting Office, marianne.leblanc@va.gov.  

1.	1.Past Experience  Provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects completed within the last three years for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.  
a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, Cost Reimbursement or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project, including difficulties and successes
e.	Your companys role and services provided for each project.
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications  Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.
3.	Teaming Arrangements  Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
4.	Commercial availability  Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
5.	Socio-Economic Status  Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VAs VetBiz repository?
6.	Price information  Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
7.	Other Market Information  Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a sole source contract to Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).
<p>Under the proposed contract TEES shall develop a capability to integrate and visualize electro-magnetic battle management information to aid in pre-mission planning for the warfighter. TEES shall develop a conceptual framework and associated components necessary to create and demonstrate an interactive and flexible data visualization and analysis workstation display specifically tailored to the tasks of Electronic Warfare Battle Management (EWBM). It shall manage EW operational, analysis and planning information, configure and operate EW and modeling and simulation tools, and aggregated visual abstracts demonstrating effective or novel approaches to EW information displays. The analytical tools and visualization modules will be aggregated in concept and function to form a dashboard like presentation tailored to the operator's functional role. The dashboard concepts and tools shall include but not be limited to, decision support tools, module integration, geospatial analysis, bookmarks, content sharing, RF analysis and Non-Obvious Relational Awareness (NORA) capabilities. The concept and tools shall include other technical, administrative and periphery modules necessary to support a comprehensive workspace for a user in an EW management, planning or analysis role.<br />The Multi-Program Research and Education Facility (MPREF) at TEES provides a secure infrastructure required to support research for the intelligence community. The MPREF contains approximately 4000 square feet of accredited SCIF space. It also has secure communications capability. The presence of NSA Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Research and Education, the George Bush School of Government and Public Service and a number of academic departments within Texas A&amp;M University allows TEES to put together a robust capability to meet the JIOWC's needs. TEES is unique in having the staff and facility resources to develop innovative approaches and tools for EWBM applications. Interdisciplinary teams of faculty, staff, and graduate students with majors in both technical and policy areas can be formed to work in the field of electro-magnetic battle space management. <br />TEES has demonstrated its capability by developing visualization products for the Department of Homeland Security, The US Coast Guard and the Animal and Plant Inspection Service. TEES' approaches in projects related to the Coast Guard Display System (CGDS) and the Dynamic Preparedness System (DPS) are highly relevant for EWBM. DPS can be considered an information dashboard. It provides a common integrated display driven by data from authoritative data sources. This is applicable to the JIOWC/EWD's need to integrate visually diverse sources of information and multiple date streams into one visual display. CGDS is a software tool which supplies to the user visual integration, information sharing, a common operating picture and decision support. All four aspects are integral to supporting military missions and EWBM. <br />This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide this service at full performance beginning 20 Sep 2010, provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer no later than 26 Aug 10.</p>

<DESC>The goal of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to reach out and discover efforts, methods, algorithms and applications that may be beyond the horizon of the Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO). The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) applicable to aircraft compatibility is a rapidly expanding field. A vast number of private companies, universities, and individuals are contributing to the field of knowledge at unprecedented rates. It is an accepted reality in the field of compatibility analysis that traditional test-and-fix methods cannot succeed with modern systems. It is in the best interest of the government to aggressively utilize S&amp;T advances to optimize the shrinking test dollars available to organizations.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Offices intent to extend an interim bridge contract to provide the services of the current Logistics Support Services contract, for a period of performance beginning 1 December 2010  31 May 2011.  A competitive contract was awarded 1 August 2004 to World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069, Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  Two interim bridge contracts were awarded consecutively with periods of performance starting 1 April 2010 through 31 July 2010 and 1 August 2010 through 30 November 2010. The extension to the second interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, W9124L-10-C-0004, which was awarded as a sole source on 1 August 2010 to World Technical Services Inc. and will expire 30 November 2010.  This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The extension will be issued to the current contractor, World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069 Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  The contract type is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract.  This extension to the current bridge contract will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Sill Installation pending resolution of a protest.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (23) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this four-month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 561210.   Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be faxed to (580)442-3819, ATTN:  Angela Triplett.  Email any questions to Mission Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sill, at angela.m.triplett@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), on behalf of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302 and award on a sole source basis to Stemnion, Inc, for continued clinical testing of the Cellular Combat Wound Initiative.  The resulting award action will be accomplished in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The sole source commercial contract resulting from this action will have Stemnion Inc. pursue the "Cellular Combat Wound Initiative" over an 18 month period of performance from approximately November 24, 2010 to May 24, 2012.  The sole source is necessary,  because Stemnion has researched and developed novel burn and wound therapies.  This acquisition will fund a series of pre-clinical trial efforts as well as FDA human clinical trials with final deliverables consisting of a report on trial outcomes.
Stemnion's novel cellular wound healing technology will accelerate and improve healing a variety of combat-related injuries and their associated chronic wounds.  Stemnion's proprietary therapies decrease tissue loss, obtain more rapid wound closure, and decrease scarring.  Applications include burn wounds, eye injuries, and therapies designed to strengthen the suture sites for abdominal surgery patients.  It is expected that the benefits of therapies developed to care for wounded servicemen and women will be immediately applicable to civilian patients across a broad spectrum of needs that range from burn victims to adults afflicted with the slow-healing wounds typical of Type II diabetes.  
This synopsis of proposed contract action is being prepared in accordance with FAR 5.201, 5.203, 6.302-1, and 6.305 and is neither a request for proposal nor a request for information.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis.

<DESC><p>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Plant Division, intends to negotiate with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM); Pittsburgh, PA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the Maximo Subscription and Support Renewal described below.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Plant and Admin Services has a requirement to renew its annual maintenance of IBM's Maximo software.</p>
<p>NIST currently has a Flexible Term Contract (FCT) for its Maximo subscription and intends to continue remaining in an FCT type account. The other type of account offered for Maximo subscriptions is a PassPort Advantage (PPA) account. However, migrating to a PPA account is not an option for the Government, as this would require upgrading to Maximo version 7, as well as losing support for the Contract and Procurement Manager component. Recent market research shows that maintenance for the following items in an FCT type account can only be provided by IBM.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: <br />IBM Part number: E037RLL<br />Description: IBM Tivoli Maximo Asset Management for IT Concurrent User Annual SW Subscription &amp; Support Renewal<br />Period of Performance: 11/15/2010 to 09/30/2011<br />Quantity: 10 EA</p>

<p>CLIN 0003:<br />IBM Part number: E03LFLL<br />Description: IBM Tivoli Maximo Asset Management MRO Tier 1 Self-Service Requestor Annual SW Subscription &amp; Support Renewal<br />Period of Performance: 11/15/2010 to 09/30/2011<br />Quantity: 100 EA</p>
<p>CLIN 0004:<br />IBM Part number: E03N6LL<br />Description: Maximo Contract &amp; Procurement Mgr Concurrent User Annual SW Subscriptio &amp; Support Renewal<br />Period of Performance: 11/15/2010 to 09/30/2011<br />Quantity: 10 EA</p>
<p>CLIN 0005:<br />IBM Part number: E0377LL<br />Description: Maximo Mobile Inventory Manager Registered User Annual SW Subscription &amp; Support Renewal<br />Period of Performance: 11/15/201 to 09/30/2011<br />Quantity: 10 EA</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to IBM for this requirement.</p>
<p>Any interested party may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to respond to this requirement, in writing, on or before November 15, 2010 at 8am EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<p>The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 a contract for 24x7x365 hardware, OS software, device interface, and Soft Computer Application maintenance services for the IBM hardware and AIX operating system for the servers installed in the Clinical Center and support the existing Laboratory Information System (LIS). The vendor will provide onsite support of and provide genuine IBM hardware parts replacement as required responding within 4 hours from notification of failure. The vendor will provide device specific interface support for the laboratory equipment which communicates with the Laboratory Information System. The vendor will provide 24x7x365 Soft Computer application level support for all the modules that the Clinical Center has currently installed. This system has outstanding reliability and flexibility and the capacity to accommodate non-standard testing methods and reporting as well as individualized specifications for different ICD's, different protocols and changing health and research objectives of NIH researchers. Additionally, this system has the capability to replace human tasks, i.e. entering test request data into test instruments, receiving results electronically, evaluating results electronically, and delivering results to the MIS. Each of these steps and others in special cases automates a formerly manual process. Each instrument that is interfaced to the Laboratory Information System creates an immediate efficiency.</p>
<p>This integrated information processing system serves Clinical Pathology (CPD), Anatomic Pathology (APD) and the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) and creates the opportunity to share important medical test data, supporting the fulfillment of the NIH Clinical Center's primary mission of supporting scientific research involving human patients.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the threshold is $25 million dollars. The anticipated period of performance will be the for period October 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The current software system, (Laboratory Information System) is proprietary to Soft Computer (SCC) who developed it and the SSC does not allow 3rd party maintenance and will not release their source code to other entities.</p>
<p>The modules of the LIS in the Clinical Center are currently handling large volumes of patient data and test and diagnostic results it is absolutely imperative that there be no interruption in the ongoing operation/functioning of the existing system. It is critical that the system continues to be maintained by SCC who is the only source capable of providing the necessary maintenance including making revisions to the source code as circumstances may dictate.</p>
<p>A Market survey was conducted in April 9, 2010.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however all responses received within 15 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<a href="mailto:dean.regazzi@va.gov">VHA GLAC Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for modifications to concurrent project.   Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital has introduced several new projects on the campus since the original design of the electrical work and since the construction contract was awarded.  Modifications are needed to the original project design and construction and a supplemental agreement is too large in price to consider as a contract option.

3.	A description of supplies/services required:  VA Hines has a requirement for additions/changes to existing project including: relocating the switchgear for Building 200 to accommodate the Building 13 Renovation Project not originally included in the Replace Campus 5kV Lines Project at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital.  These changes are needed to allow for a Winter-garden plus Geothermal HVAC System that links Buildings 12, 13, and 200 in a traffic circle that facilitates veteran access to these buildings.  Original award did not include integration of electrical 5KV feeders to bldgs. 12 & 13.

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-5(b)(6), 15USC 657f.  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies and timely services available from this source.   

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The technical complexity of this 5KV electrical feeders project requires existing project contractor to continue with this concurrent add-on project.  Professional expertise on project limits the ability for new contractors to tie into an existing, ongoing project.  Allowing open bid to another contractor will further delay the construction project and create integration and continuity of project issues. This is a critical project to the upgrade of electrical services throughout the VA Hines campus.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  N/A -Sole source to SDVOSB Specialty Trade (NAICS 238210) on continuing project. 

7.   Determination that the price is fair & reasonable:  The CO and COTR have processed project quotes from existing project to compare similar pricing.  The COTR has also developed an IGE for this "add on" phase. The CO and COTR expect the pricing from Stokes-Webb to be received as fair and reasonable based on current contract they were awarded by open market bid.  The CO and COTR will further ensure fair/reasonable pricing by negotiation and mutual agreement between all parties prior to awarding contract.  



8.  A description of the market research conducted or statement why market research was not conducted:  Market research through NAICS specific 238210 and SDVOSB shows 51 contractors statewide.  However, the need for integrating with concurrent work, and time and cost savings to the government is critical to successful completion of the added portion of this project.  Stokes-Webb LLC is certified in Vet-Biz as a SDVOSB firm, and registered in ORCA, D&B, CCR, and VETs-100, and eligible for sole source award in accordance with the requirements in Public Law 109-461.  It is recommended that the VA seek the services of Stokes-Webb LLC as an SDVOSB sole source contractor for this supplementary project.

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: Public Law 109-461.  Also, the COTR justification included has additional details supporting the justification of allowing Stokes-Webb continue with additional work as an integrated portion of concurrent project.

10.   A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  N/A

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>&nbsp; This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Timber Ridge Bison, 1350 250th Street, Waverly, IA 50677. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) ,MWA, USDA at Ames, IA for 32 bison heifers less than ten (10) months of age that have not been vaccinated with brucellosis vaccines and from a single herd free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Heifers must have good eyes and be sound on feet and legs. The bison heifers are available only through Timber Ridge Bison. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Timber Ridge Bison without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). <br />USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Columbia, MO location.<br />2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).<br />a. This contracting action is to obtain 32 bison heifers to be used for research purposes. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).<br />32 bison heifers, less than 10 months of age that have not been vaccinated with brucellosis vaccines and from a single herd free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Heifers must have good eyes and be sound on feet and legs. <br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).<br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) <br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, <br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." <br />(2) The named vendor maintains NADC's bison genetic needs and is an agreeable travel distance from the Center. Transport time has to be at a minimum due to the temperament of the bison. Bison are needed for a vaccine experiment and previous vaccine experiments have utilized bison obtained from this vendor. Obtaining bison from a different source may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiments that may lead to increased variability in immune responses and impair comparison of vaccine responses across experiments. This herd is free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a significant cause of mortality in many bison herds. Currently available diagnostics lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect infected herds or individuals. Purchase of bison with MCF would make all data from proposed experiment invalid and nonpublishable. Of equal concern would be the possibility that MCF could be inadvertently introduced into bison in other experiments (i.e. deer) at NADC; a scenario that would be devastating to several ongoing brucellosis, tuberculosis, and possibly prior research projects. A previous procurement of bison did result in procurement of MCF-positive bison. <br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.<br />b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.<br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).<br />After a thorough web search, no other suppliers were located that could supply this consumable.<br />8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).<br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the consumable is malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) free and only available from the vendor identified. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other existing items can meet the research requirements. If competition occurs in the future and maintaining genetic consistency is not required for a given experiment, testing of additional resource herds can be performed for environmental bacteria status. Other sources will be identified if they meet the requirements for transport. Transport time has to be at a minimum due to procurement of the animal. <br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2MACONGA is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 10-24 November 2010 in the Macon, GA area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.<BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>UNICOR intends to purchase the following targets from US Molders on a sole source basis. We have been unable to locate these types of targets from any other sources. Vendors having the ability to make and/or supply UNICOR with targets equivalent to the US Molders targets should supply a quotation to UNICOR by November 18, 2010, 2 PM - Eastern Standard Time. These quotations should be sent to mpellien@central.unicor.gov or they can be faxed to (304) 626-2512. Attention: Mark Pellien.
<p>(Must be US Molders part # U-401RT or equal)</p>

<p>Real Threat (RT) Light Duty Truck Frontal [Color: Plain - not painted]<br />Quantity needed: 60 each</p>
<p>The Real Threat (RT) Truck Frontal is a unique target display that improves training for group and individual enemy engagement and target recognition training. The RT Truck Frontal's life-like appearance comes from a permanent molding process that fuses the target details directly to the target surface, thus eliminating cracking, chipping, or peeling, and enhancing target realism.</p>
<p>UNICOR requires a unique target display that improves training for group and individual enemy engagement and target recognition training. This display can be placed in a stationary position or can be mounted on most types of heavy lifters.</p>
<p>This unique target display improves training for group and individual enemy engagement and target recognition training. This display can be placed in a stationary position, or can be mounted on most types of heavy lifters. It is useful for lanes training and convoy activities, including Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP) collective tasks. The realism of the RT Light Duty Truck Frontal is created through a permanent photographic mold-in-graphic process. This process produces a target that simulates real threat vehicles. Targets are constructed of high-density polyethylene, and last longer than plywood or cardboard targets. If ever needed, an armor patch kit is also available to extend the life of the target for these items.</p>
<p>The RT Light Duty Truck Frontal is designed to be durable and highly realistic, and will help train soldiers for the kinds of threats they will face in the field.</p>
<p>Dimensions (inches): 75x18x70 Weight: 110lbs</p>
<p>&bull; Offers option of open windshield or windshield graphics, at no extra cost<br />&bull; No assembly required-can be used in freestanding position, or mounted on most major types heavy MAT &amp; SAT lifters.</p>

Evaluation will be based on an acceptable or unacceptable past performance evaluation from the references provided, and any other performance known to the government.

The applicable North American Standard Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611.<BR><BR><BR>The North Atlantic Regional Contracting Office (NARCO), McDonald Army Health Center, Fort Eustis, VA has a requirement for the following:<BR><BR>CLIN 0001<BR>THE CONTRACROR SHALL PROVIDE ALL LABOR, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CONSULTING AND ADVISEMENTS ON THE JOINT COMMISSION CHANGES ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF CARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS WITHIN MCDONALD ARMY HEALTH CENTER, FORT EUSTIS, VA.  VISIT IS FOR TWO (2) DAYS IN LENGTH.<BR><BR>Delivery Information:<BR>November 18 -19, 2010, McDonald Army Health Center, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604<BR><BR><BR>The Government anticipates awarding a single award for this requirement.  No exceptions or compatibles will be accepted.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:<BR>FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. <BR> Addendum to 52.212-1 applies  The non-FAR part 12 discretionary FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and MEDCOM provisions. <BR>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>TECHNICAL, PRICE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE<BR><BR>Addendum to 52.212-2,  (a)  The Government reserves the right to award other than the low offeror for the best price that is advantageous to the Governments using Brand Name, Technical, Price and  Past Performance. (b)  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expenses must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance. (c)  Evaluation Criteria.  Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror with an acceptable record of past performance.<BR>Technical is more important than price, when combined are more important than past performance.<BR>The offerors technical proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability and will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Past Performance will be evaluated for acceptable performance.  Any rating except for high risk will be considered acceptable past performance.  All other ratings shall be treated equally.  Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror with an acceptable record of past performance.<BR>PART I:  TECHNICAL EVALUATION.<BR>Technical evaluation will be based on the following:<BR>(a)  The offerors technical proposal and all submitted literature must be complete.  The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation for substantiating that the items offered meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The proposal shall not simply rephrase or restate the Governments requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address that the products offered clearly meet the Governments requirements.  Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge, and will base its evaluation solely on the information presented in the offerors proposal.<BR>(b)  The following ratings will be used in evaluation offerors proposal:<BR>Acceptable  To receive this rating, the offeror shall present a proposal that clearly and comprehensively addresses the technical factor.  The offeror shall provide sufficient details for the Government to determine that the items offered satisfactorily meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  The proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is capable of performing the requirement for the total proposed price indicated in its proposal.<BR>Unacceptable  An unacceptable rating will be assessed on any offeror that presents a proposal that demonstrates any of the following:<BR>(1)  Fails to clearly and comprehensively address each of the factors.(2)  Fails to provide sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of this solicitation in addressing the factors.(3)  Fails to clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is technically capable to perform the requirements at its total proposed price.<BR>Note:  To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved in all technical factors.<BR>PART II:  PRICE.<BR>Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability.  Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer.<BR>PART III:  PAST PERFORMANCE.<BR>The offerors performance will be rated in terms of performance risk.  A performance risk rating (Low, Moderate or High) will be assigned dependent upon the evaluators assessment of the level of confidence in the offerors performance record.  In ranking offerors assessed in the same performance risk category, an offeror with experience in performing services will be ranked as a low risk compared to an offer with no or hardly any experience in performing services.  The information which will be used for evaluation will be obtained from those presented in the Offerors past performance documentation, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), (http://www.ppirs.gov/)), and any other Government sources.  The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that any information that has a negative impact on the offerors past performance record has been deleted, misrepresented or withheld.<BR>High Risk  Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the service under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms.<BR>Medium Risk  Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.  Good/Low.<BR>Low Risk  Little doubt exists, based on the offerors preponderance of good, if not excellent past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.<BR>Neutral Risk  No relevant past performance information.<BR>The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from other sources, to include CPARS, and consider such information in making its past performance determination.<BR>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items (Oct 2010) <BR>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  <BR>FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items; <BR>FAR 52.232-33, Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration; <BR>FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies;  <BR>FAR 52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998); <BR>DFARS Clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Request (MAR 2008); <BR>DFARS Clause 252.204-7007 Alt A, Required Central Contractor Registration Alternate A (Nov 2003); <BR>Full text of provisions and clauses may be accessed electronically at the following address: http://www.arnet.gov/far.  <BR> Questions concerning this acquisition may be address to rita.y.ware@amedd.army.mil.  <BR>Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p><br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than 22 NOV 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (GG-913)<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

REFER TO ATTACHMENT-A FOR FULL CLIN LISTING and Performance Work Statement (PWS). Pricing for services should proposed by unit as illustrated. 

The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and (DFARS) apply to this solicitation. 52.204-9 Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel, 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards,  52.209-6 Protecting the Governments Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment, FAR 52.217-3 Evaluation Exclusive of Options (Apr 84), FAR 52.217-4 Evaluation of Options Exercised at Time of Contract Award (Jun 98), FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 90), FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 99). FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial; Government;

52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items: (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1. Past Performance
Factor 2. Price

In evaluating proposals for award, Past Performance is the most important factor. Past performance is more important than Price.  ALTHOUGH PRICE IS NOT FORMALLY SCORED, IT IS IMPORTANT AND CANNOT BE IGNORED. THE DEGREE OF ITS IMPORTANCE WILL INCREASE WITH THE DEGREE OF EQUALITY OF THE PROPOSALS IN RELATION TO EVALUATION FACTORS. 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision52.212-2);

ADDENDUM to 52.212-2: EVALUATION FACTORS
The Government will award a fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, considering the evaluated rating of all technical factors, price and related factors. A single contract will be awarded against this solicitation.
Except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarifications, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a pricing and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
If discussions become necessary following the initial evaluation, the competitive range may be limited. The Contracting Officer may determine that the number of proposals that would otherwise remain in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. The competitive range may be limited to the greatest number of proposals that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

Award will be based on the best overall value offered in meeting the requirements with acceptable risk at a fair and reasonable price and will not necessarily be made to the low offeror. The decision will be based on the best value offered. 

A proposal that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements. Such proposals may be determined as marginal or unsatisfactory. For a proposal to be considered for award, a rating of satisfactory or better must be achieved on all factors and sub-factors.
PAST PERFORMANCE (Factor 1): Each offerors Past Performance will be evaluated and assigned an adjectival rating. The following rating scheme for Performance Risk will be used: Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk and Unknown Risk.
PERFORMANCE RISK: Past and Performance Analysis provides insight into an offerors probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements stated in the solicitation based on the offerors performance record on recent, relevant, and similar contract efforts. The number and severity of problems, the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall performance record are to be taken into consideration. 

RISK DEFINITION
LOW RISK:  Little doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.
MODERATE RISK:  Some doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.
HIGH RISK:  Significant doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.
UNKNOWN RISK:  Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.
PRICE (Factor 2) is not rated. Price and cost analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offerors proposed price. Price will be evaluated for realism, value offered for the price, and extent, which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.

EVALUATION FACTORS.
Factor 1. Past Performance 
Factor 2. Price

Evaluation of past performance will be subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The currency, content, general trends, and relevance of the information in contactors performance will be considered. 
The Government may also consider and use any additional information from its own files, databases, references provided by the offeror, or from any source, as it deems appropriate. The Government may contact references to verify information provided and may contact other sources known to the Government.
If adverse past performance information is obtained, the respective point of contact will be contacted to obtain additional information about the circumstances surrounding the situation. Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance to which the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to respond. The offerors response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration. If an offeror does not have a past performance history relating to the solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably, and a neutral rating will be given for this factor. (End of Provision, 52.212-2)

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />U.S. COAST GUARD<br />HU-25 AUXILIARY POWER UNIT REPAIR<br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen (13) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel. These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments. The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) model GTCP36-100C is a gas turbine engine, which is essentially a self-contained power source providing pneumatic and rotational shaft power. The APU provides AC/DC electrical power for the HU-25 aircraft systems prior to engine start or during selected emergency procedures. It also provides a pneumatic source for the operation of environmental systems during ground operations. APU's and their subcomponents are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status. It also provides an effective method of configuration control. History has shown the APU to be highly reliable, with the exception of internal oil seals leaking oil in to the gas path. Otherwise, little more is required than scheduled maintenance and inspections. The APU requires repair following: 2700 airframe operating hours, Foreign Object Damage (FOD), internal oil leaks, or mechanical failure beyond the scope of normal line maintenance.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Coast Guards objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to repair and provide complete, ready-to-install GTCP36-100C APU's for the HU-25 that are certified for flight with an FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document. A Certificate of Conformance (COC) may be substituted for the FAA 8130-3 only if the COC is deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard desires a Turn-Around-Time of no greater than 180 days from time of material receipt at contractor's facility to prevent Aircraft On Ground (AOG) supply issues.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Repaired APU's must comply with the current Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) specifications, drawings, Service Bulletins, and performance requirements as set forth in the OEM technical specifications. The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested. This includes, but is not limited to; required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts storage, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc, to repair GTCP36-100C APU's. Packaging and preservation shall be in accordance with (IAW) maintenance manual GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2, dated 03 Sept. 1985.</p>
<p>The offeror's responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component. Configuration of the APU must be maintained by ensuring that all OEM Service Bulletins remain incorporated.</p>
<p>Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) MRS Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.</p>
<p>B. To meet the Coast Guard's objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Technical</p>
<p>a. Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, fixtures and parts to meet current OEM specifications as referenced in paragraph 3.0.A.<br />b. Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan.<br />c. Provide evidence of, and ability to maintain, a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. Provide documentation of having performed repair of similar or like items.<br />Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references' name, company, phone number, and e-mail address. <br /><br />4.0 Service Bulletins: <br />All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer. The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins. Upon receipt of an APU requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration. In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract. The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component. The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups. The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated. Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.<br />5.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: The following Technical Specifications are applicable:<br />GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2., dated 03 Sept. 1985.<br />6.0 Government Furnished Property:<br />One (1) APU Harness, P/N 3888080 will be provided to contractor for testing of APU's.<br />7.0 Data availability:<br />7.1.1 OEM Technical data, Service Bulletins, drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the U.S. Coast guard.<br />The GFP will be returned to the Coast Guard in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition should the contract be terminated, cancelled, or expire.</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Provisions and Clauses Apply:<br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. (June 2008) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />Evaluation Factors: The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution. The best value for the Coast Guard may merit a higher price based on technical superiority. Using sound business judgment, the government will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical/Management Solution/Approach<br />Factor 2 - Performance Measures and Metrics<br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Cost/Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3. While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation rating for technical factors approach equal.</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach</p>
<p>The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of auxiliary power unit (APU) and component part refurbishment (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management /solution/approach includes:</p>
<p>(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be implemented to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.</p>
<p>(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.</p>
<p>(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.<br />&bull; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.<br />&bull; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance. i.e. ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document or COC.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics</p>
<p>The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:</p>
<p>(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives.<br />(b) Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness<br />(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor's actual performance on repair of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Cost/Price</p>
<p>Each Contractor's cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: If applicable, a realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for reach identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the contractor's proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a sole source contract to Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).
<p>Under the proposed contract TEES shall develop a capability to integrate and visualize electro-magnetic battle management information to aid in pre-mission planning for the warfighter. TEES shall develop a conceptual framework and associated components necessary to create and demonstrate an interactive and flexible data visualization and analysis workstation display specifically tailored to the tasks of Electronic Warfare Battle Management (EWBM). It shall manage EW operational, analysis and planning information, configure and operate EW and modeling and simulation tools, and aggregated visual abstracts demonstrating effective or novel approaches to EW information displays. The analytical tools and visualization modules will be aggregated in concept and function to form a dashboard like presentation tailored to the operator's functional role. The dashboard concepts and tools shall include but not be limited to, decision support tools, module integration, geospatial analysis, bookmarks, content sharing, RF analysis and Non-Obvious Relational Awareness (NORA) capabilities. The concept and tools shall include other technical, administrative and periphery modules necessary to support a comprehensive workspace for a user in an EW management, planning or analysis role.<br />The Multi-Program Research and Education Facility (MPREF) at TEES provides a secure infrastructure required to support research for the intelligence community. The MPREF contains approximately 4000 square feet of accredited SCIF space. It also has secure communications capability. The presence of NSA Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Research and Education, the George Bush School of Government and Public Service and a number of academic departments within Texas A&amp;M University allows TEES to put together a robust capability to meet the JIOWC's needs. TEES is unique in having the staff and facility resources to develop innovative approaches and tools for EWBM applications. Interdisciplinary teams of faculty, staff, and graduate students with majors in both technical and policy areas can be formed to work in the field of electro-magnetic battle space management. <br />TEES has demonstrated its capability by developing visualization products for the Department of Homeland Security, The US Coast Guard and the Animal and Plant Inspection Service. TEES' approaches in projects related to the Coast Guard Display System (CGDS) and the Dynamic Preparedness System (DPS) are highly relevant for EWBM. DPS can be considered an information dashboard. It provides a common integrated display driven by data from authoritative data sources. This is applicable to the JIOWC/EWD's need to integrate visually diverse sources of information and multiple date streams into one visual display. CGDS is a software tool which supplies to the user visual integration, information sharing, a common operating picture and decision support. All four aspects are integral to supporting military missions and EWBM. <br />This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide this service at full performance beginning 8 December 2010, provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer no later than&nbsp;15 November&nbsp;10.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to: 1) extend the due date for delivery of proposals and past performance questionnaires to Monday, November 15, 2010 by 10:00 a.m. local prevailing time; 2) authorize the delivery of a proposal addendum for offeror's that have already delivered a proposal or for proposals in route for delivery; 3) incorporate a revised Attachment J-2 entitled Cost Proposal Template Amendment 6, to replace the AttachmentJ-2 incorporated via Amendment 000001; and 4) incorporate a revised RFP_MLN Solicitation Section B-M entitled "Amendment 6 RFP_MLN Solicitation Section B-M.pdf" to replace "Amendment 5 RFP_MLN Solicitation Section B-M.pdf". Accordingly, the following amendments are made:<br />Attachment J-2 provided via Amendment 000001, is replaced in its entirety with the attached "Amendment_6_Attach_J.2_Revised_Cost_Proposal_Template_MLN_Product_Fulfillment_xlsx". The Cost Proposal Template is amended to reflect a correction in the discrepancy between the description of sub-CLINs ending in AD through AF for the base period and the sub-CLIN descriptions ending in AD through AF for the optional periods. All sub-CLINs ending in AD through AF are for the Optional Hosting of an additional Web Based Course. The description of sub-CLINs ending in AA are revised to the following: Hosting Services (includes up to 25 web based courses existing and updated).<br />Solicitation Sections A (paragraph 9 of the SF33) and L.11 are amended to reflect a revised due date for delivery of proposals and past performance questionnaires to Monday, November 15, 2010 by 10:00 a.m. local prevailing time. <br />Solicitation Section L.11 is amended to reflect the incorporation of the following paragraph:<br />If after an offeror submits its proposal or is in route to submit its proposal in response to this solicitation an amendment to the solicitation necessitates a change in the submitted proposal, an addendum to the already submitted proposal may be submitted to CMS provided it is received at CMS on or before the proposal due date of November 15, 2010, 10:00 a.m. local prevailing time. If no proposal addendums are submitted, CMS will assume that the proposal as originally submitted remains unchanged as a result of any amendment.<br />The above described amendments are reflected via the track changes tool in the attached document entitled, "Amendment 6 RFP_MLN Solicitation Section B-M.pdf".

<DESC><p>Amendment 01: The purpose of this amendment is to revise the times of the Proposer's Day. See the revised Proper's Day Conference document attached and the revised information below.</p>
<p>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE<br />DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of the BAA11-14, All Source Positioning and Navigation (ASPN) program on November 12, 2010 via web conference, from 11am to 3pm. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the ASPN program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The All Source Positioning and Navigation (ASPN) program seeks to enable low cost, robust, and seamless navigation solutions for military users on any operational platform and in any environment, with or without GPS. In particular, ASPN will develop the architectures, abstraction methods, and navigation filtering algorithms needed for rapid integration and reconfiguration of any combination of sensors. This will enable rapid adaptation to evolving missions as well as reduce the system integration costs and time-to-market for navigation solutions in general.</p>
<p>Topic One: Navigation Algorithms. This topic focuses on the derivation and development of new navigation filtering (e.g., fusion) algorithms for positioning and navigation solutions.</p>
<p>Topic Two: Navigation Software Architecture. This topic addresses the development of novel processing approaches and/or architectures that support plug-and-play reconfiguration of both sensors and IMU devices on a navigation system.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT November 9, 2010 at the following website: http://www.schafertmd.com/aspn/. All other materials, including instructions for participation in the web conference, are also available on the website. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public. Due to call-in line limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 50 registrants, with no more than one registrant per organization and call-in location. All attendees will be required to fax government issued photo identification in order to log on to the event. Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference. Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request". The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to: Angela Burton, Schafer Corperation, fax 703-807-1732, phone 703-516-6092, no later than November 9, 2010. Both documents are available for download at the registration website.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.<br />To facilitate potential teaming discussions and interchange among the potential proposer community, an online message board/discussion forum will be created. A list of Proposers' Day registrants' contact information will also be made available. Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so. Presentations may contain 5 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues). Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact Angela Burton (angela.burton.ctr@darpa.mil) as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers' Day Conference.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance. An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by November 9, 20010. There will be no exceptions to this requirement.</p>
<p>NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPOSERS' DAY ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT INSTEAD ADDRESS ALL INQUIRIES AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>Release Date: July 29, 2010</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br />NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any responses to this RFI should be submitted by August 19, 2010, 11:00 AM EST.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI). It is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals"). FAR 11.101 ("Order of precedence for requirements documents") requires agencies to develop requirements documents to meet agency needs that utilize performance-oriented documents based on voluntary industry consensus standards to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>
<p>These referenced documents may be accessed electronically at the OFPP website located at <br />http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/. Please frame any responses to this notice in accordance with the policies contained in these references. <br /><br /><br /><br />II. LIST OF ATTACHMENTS</p>

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Engineering Services  Dallas, desires to establish an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a professionally qualified Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm to provide the design disciplines necessary for various projects, including other A-E related services and studies at various locations throughout the Continental U.S. and Alaska. Interested firms shall provide completed qualification statements. Qualification Statements submitted in response to this notice must be received no later than 2pm Central Time, November 16, 2010, and will be used to determine the most highly qualified A-E firm. The selected A-E firm will then be asked to propose various rates for the eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Individual projects under the IDIQ contract will be negotiated and awarded on separate delivery orders issued after a firm fixed-price is agreed to by both parties based on various applicable rates in the basic IDIQ contract.

Required A-E Services
The resultant A-E Services IDIQ contract will include, but is not be limited to the following A-E Services: 

1.	Feasibility Studies 
2.	Housing Studies 
3.	Environmental Assessments
4.	Facilities Conditions Assessment
5.	Program Development for Facilities Studies 
6.	Budget Estimating Analysis
7.	Building Code Review to include Fire Protection (NFPA, IBC)
8.	Design reviews by various disciplines (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, civil, etc.).

About the Resultant Contract
The dollar range estimated for most projects and studies that would be awarded under the resultant IDIQ contract is between $5,000 and $125,000.  However, actual project workload is unknown at this time, and higher or lower dollar value projects are possible. There will be no guarantee as to the exact dollar amount of the projects to be awarded under any resultant A-E Services IDIQ contract.

The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates to be used to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects and be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Governments discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single A-E firm under this IDIQ requirement.
Overhead and hourly rates for the base year and all option years will be negotiated prior to the contract award. A formal audit of the proposed contractors records may be conducted to establish a reasonable base rate and professional man-hour rates.  

The minimum/maximum delivery order amount will be $2,500/$1,000,000. The resultant contract will be for an initial performance period of 365 days from the date of contract award.  Four additional one-year performance periods are contemplated as options that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government based on the contractors performance and the Governments needs. The volume of projects placed under the contract will, in part, be determined on the awardees ongoing contract performance record.

NOTICE OF SET-ASIDE: This acquisition is available for full and open competition to all firms.  

A-E Qualification Statement Submission Form and Format

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska, intends to enter into a single source contract with Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana, for reagents. The set of reagents to be purchased are sufficient to obtain a full genome coverage of a bovid genome and are sold as a "de novo genome" package including:<br />7 GS Titanium Sequencing Kit XLR70, part number 05 233 526 001<br />7 GS Titanium PicoTiter Plate Kit 70x75, part number 05 233 682 001<br />7 GS FLX Titanium LV emPCR Kit Lib-L, part number 05 618 428 001<br />1 GS Titanium emPCR Breaking Kits LV/MV, part number 05 233 658 001<br />1 GS Rapid Library Prep Kit, part number 05 608 228 001<br />1 GS Titanium Paired End Adapter Kit, part number 05 463 343 001<br />The reagents and supplies are intended to support running a Genome Sequencer FLX system housed at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center. The Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (GS FLX) is a DNA sequencer designed and built by 454 Life Sciences and distributed by Roche Applied Science. The technology for this system is based on enrichment of fragmented DNA followed by clonal amplification and pyrosequencing. The sequencer can generate up to 500 million bases per 7.5 hour run, achieve reads averaging 350 to 450 bases, attain over 1,000,000 reads per run, generate single-read accuracy that is greater than 99%, and achieve consensus accuracy greater than 99.99%. Reagents required to run this system include GS Titanium compatible library preparation kits for linker modified single stranded DNA, emulsion based PCR kits for preparative reactions of bead-linked DNA fragments for sequencing, Titanium chemistry sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits which provide the surface for sequencing of the DNA fragments.<br />Roche is the sole supplier and distributor of the GS FLX instrument. The GS titanium library preparation reagents, emulsion based PCR kits, sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits are only available through Roche. The GS FLX warranty is conditional that customers agree to use the instrument in strict accordance with Roche operating instructions, including Roche sole source specifications regarding reagent kits. To our knowledge, the FLX sequencer makes use of very specialized reagents only available from Roche at the present time in a form suitable for use on the instrument.<br />

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Contracting Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Regional Office 377.

2.	Nature and/or Description of Action: Notice of Other Than Full and Open competition for the procurement of Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Chapter 31 Education and Vocational Services having an estimated value of $105,750.

4.	Statutory Authority: The services are being procured under the authority of 38 U.S.C 8127(b), FAR 6.302-5 and VAAR 819.7007. 38 U.S.C. 8127(b) expressly authorizes the use of noncompetitive procedures for small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities (SDVOSB).

5.	Demonstration of contractor unique qualifications: The requested Chapter 31 Education and Vocational Services are to meet the immediate needs of veterans until a new national services contract can be procured. An SDVOSB with experience and acceptable performance from the prior national contract is best suited to meet the need based on having a current staff of approved counselors (both employees and subcontractors) that have met all the professional and background investigation checks required in performance of the contract.  Background investigations normally take 45 days to complete coupled with another 30 days for staffing leaves the regional office behind schedule in providing much-needed and timely services to veterans. 

6.	Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including notice publication:  See par. 4 and 5 above.  The proposed contract action will be synopsized at www.fbo.gov in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.	Fair and reasonable price determination: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using recent history of price for this type of service and comparison with the independent government estimate.  

8.	Market research: Market research was developed to support the independent government estimate. Data is also available from the recently completed national contract for the same services, which was competitively procured.

9.	Other facts: None.

10.	A listing of sources expressing an interest in writing: None

11.	Statement of action for barriers to competition: None.

12.	Contracting Officer certification: I hereby certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
