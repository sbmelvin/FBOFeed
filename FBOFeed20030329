<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a non-competitive contract modification with Sigma One Corporation, P.O. Box 12836, Research Triangle Park, NC 17709 under existing contract no. 641-C-00-98-00229.  This modification will extend the completion date of the contract by 12 months, from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004.  The Contract was competed under full and open competition and its original purpose will remain unchanged.  After the contract was awarded the Mission's Country Strategic Plan (CSP) was extended to September 30, 2003 and most recently further extended to September 30, 2004. The modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly-specialized technical assistance to the Government of Ghana in key economic policy reform areas until the new CSP is approved and contract(s) for a successor project is competed and awarded.  USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70, where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.  This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement in accordance with numbered note 22.  Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is planning a Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study of soil mapping services in the NRCS offices in Colorado.  These services are currently provided by Government personnel.  The final products of these services are completed and field correlated soil surveys for a designated geographical area determined in the solicitation.  Major components of this work include:  researching existing information pertaining to the survey area (i.e. existing soil surveys, topographic and geologic maps, and aerial photographs); conducting soil mapping activities, collecting and analyzing field data, and  identifying soil types and series that will meet or exceed National Cooperative Soil Survey standards; preparing samples of the soil profile and descriptions from the surface to a depth of 60 inches; classifying samples by soil taxonomy and assigning a series name;  developing map units and maintaining official map unit legend; compiling official field notes, soil profile sheets, field transect sheets, and mapping field sheets by map unit; and entering all documentation into the National Soils Information System (NASIS).  This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  Prospective offerers are advised that a contract may not be awarded if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance of Government personnel.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541370, Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services.  If you are interested in competing for this requirement, please indicate your interest by sending an email to Tony Doxtater at tony.doxtater@co.usda.gov  NOT LATER THAN APRIL 4, 2003.

<SUBJECT>R -- OMB Circular A-76 Commercial Activities Study of Clerical Support Services in Colorado
<DESC>The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service-Colorado State Office (NRCS), intends to conduct one A-76 cost comparison study in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures on clerical support functions in Lakewood, Grand Junction, Greeley, La Junta, and Alamosa.  The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for clerical support services. Major components of this work include:  managing incoming and outgoing telephone calls; receiving visitors and responding to them in a professional manner; communicating with employees in a courteous and respectful manner; performing reproduction/duplication services as requested; handling incoming and outgoing mail; utilizing automated communication techniques (fax, email, voice messaging, etc.); prepares a wide range of documents utilizing computer software package, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Access; performs typing, proofreading, and filing with minimal errors; and organizes meetings and conferences. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in the services described above should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer tony.doxtater@co.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date. Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer (Tony Doxtater).
