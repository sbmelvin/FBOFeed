<DESC>The objective is to develop highly loaded, highly dispersed nanoparticle filled dielectric material systems with controlled uniformity and minimal defects. Such dielectrics will be used for capacitors with packaged energy densities &gt;2 J/cc, high breakdown, low loss &lt;0.1 and sub microsecond (&micro;s) discharge times. The overarching goal is to provide significant improvements in the maximum energy storage density by improving breakdown strength and permittivity (&epsilon;r) while decreasing loss for high energy density capacitors in pulsed power applications. High density, high-performance power conditioning and control electronics are needed for compact, reliable electrical power on air and space platforms to support more electric aircraft and high voltage loads for directed-energy weapons. Lightweight, compact, high energy density capacitors capable of operation at several megajoules per pulse and repetition rates on the order of 100 pulses per second are needed. Nanomaterials with unique chemical and physical properties have the potential to make revolutionary advances in the area of advanced dielectrics for these applications.

<DESC>The scope of this project encompasses all of the work necessary to place a pre-fabricated concrete well house in the vicinity of a previously constructed Class IIB potable water well and to connect the wells pitless adapter to the well house and subsequently to potable water storage tanks. Approximately 300 linear feet of small bore high density polyethylene pipe will be laid in conjunction with this project. Approximately 100 linear feet of small bore galvanized steel pipe and appurtenances. All work will be done in accordance with State and Federal regulations for public water systems. The project also includes installing a control system for the well that is actuated by the water level in two existing potable water reservoirs. Both reservoirs (one 50,000 and one 20,000) will receive float assemblies so that the level in an individual tank can control the well pump. The control wires will enter and exit the water tanks through watertight conduit running into an external junction box. Both control sets will utilize the same junction box placed near the smaller of the two tanks. The wires will then run from the junction box through conduit to the well house in the same trench as the water line. There will be termination quasite boxes at each end of the conduit. The well house will be plumbed with various fixtures, drains, and a chlorination system which is actuated by a float control switch which monitors when water is flowing from the well.BWork also includes, but not limited to; all respective excavation, bedding, thrust blocks, backfill, and road rehabilitation & repair for the installation of the said water line plus the furnishing and installing conduit in the same trench with in-ground for control wiring/cabling with termination quasite boxes offset from the trench just beyond the immediate road surface/ditch line and junction/pull boxes on the adjacent building walls. Quasite boxes shall also be provided at the end of each subsequent conduit run/termination other than at the chlorinator building. Work also includes, but not limited to provisions from ground disturbance activities associated with the project such as erosion and sediment control and permanent fine grading & seeding of the impacted areas.CWork includes installing approximately 1000 linear feet of 3 inch schedule 80 PVC pipe to accommodate installation of electrical service to the well house in A above. The electrical conduit will have long sweep 90s at each end and two others at the transformer location. All conduit and electrical appliances except transformer and wire within this conduit will be the responsibility of the contractor. This portion of the project will require coordination with Shenandoah Valley Electric Company, the local utility provider. A meter base is available from the Electric Company at no charge if the contractor chooses to use the provided meter base, it will be the responsibility of the contractor to attain the meter base.DAll work will be performed under a single contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for full multi-discipline professional Architect-Engineering (AE) design services in support of LBNL Facilities Division's construction projects and services.  The subcontract will be an indefinite delivery task order type contract.  Berkeley National Laboratory is a large diversified research facility consisting of over 80 buildings spread over 200 acres of hilly terrain adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley Campus as well as off-site facilities in the cities of Berkeley, Oakland, Emeryville and Walnut Creek.  The project types may include new construction, alterations and improvements to existing laboratory, industrial, and office facilities, tenant improvements in leased facilities, and underground infrastructure modifications.</p>
<p>LBNL intends to enter into a subcontract with one or more firms to perform multi-task assignments issued as separate tasks under the subcontract.  The subcontract will be for a period of three years, with an option, at the sole discretion of the University, to extend for up to two additional one-year periods.  One or more task assignments, of no guaranteed amount or duration, will be issued during the contract term.  Individual tasks will be performed on a lump sum or hourly rate basis, and will vary in complexity and duration.  Construction cost of projects for which services are requested will range from $30,000.00 to $500,000.00.  The University makes no guarantee as to the dollar value or number of task assignments to be authorized pursuant to the award of the subcontract.</p>
<p>A typical project will consist of the following phases and design services:<br />1.	Conceptual design that will be developed from a site visit, discussions with the user and subject matter experts (SME). The conceptual design will convey basic information so a rough cost estimate and schedule can be developed.<br />2.	Should the project receive approval, the design phase shall begin based on the selected delivery method. These delivery methods will be determined by the Project Manager, ranging from Design/Bid/Build to Design/Build (Bridging Documents).<br />3.	Construction Administration: Bid Walk and bid assistance, bid review, submittal review, RFI responses, site inspection, punchlist and warranty administration.</p>
<p><br />Types of Projects:<br />1.	Office and laboratory renovations and modifications<br />2.	Research equipment installations<br />3.	Infrastructure replacement and improvements<br />4.	Site repair and modifications<br />5.	Design standards including specifications development</p>
<p>Issuance of subcontract tasks will be contingent upon available funding.  LBNL is free to assign and allocate architect-engineering requirements with other engineering firms that are under contract or may be selected in the future.  In addition, LBNL retains the exclusive right to perform all or any portion of the architect-engineering requirements.</p>

<SUBJECT>Low Frost-Point Generator (LFPG) External Temperature-Control System (ETCS)
<SOLNBR>AMD-12-SS01
<RESPDATE>110711
<CONTACT>Judy K. Pace, Contract Specialist, Phone 3019752752, Email judy.pace@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Fax 301-975-8884, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Low Frost-Point Generator (LFPG) External Temperature-Control System (ETCS). The NIST LFPG is our nation's primary humidity generation standard for trace humidity. The humidity generator currently produces humid nitrogen streams by flowing dry nitrogen over ice maintained at a constant temperature between -100 &deg;C and 0 &deg;C. This humidification process occurs within a cylindrical copper saturator, maintained in vacuum in order that heat from the laboratory environment does not unduly impose temperature gradients on the ice. The temperature of the saturator, and the ice contained within, is adjusted and maintained by pumping heat between the saturator and adjacent disc-shaped copper heat reservoirs (one each located at the flat top and bottom surfaces of the saturator) using Peltier heat pumps. The temperature of the heat reservoirs is currently adjusted by expanding a mixture of liquefied ethylene and propane within the reservoirs. The refrigeration system supplying this mixture has reached the end of its service life and must be replaced. In addition, industrial need for enhanced trace humidity standards compels NIST to decrease the lowest operating temperature to -120 &deg;C. Because of the increased temperature range and difficulty of expanding refrigerants inside the heat reservoirs over a wide temperature range, NIST anticipates that the new system will contain more than one refrigeration subsystem, and will transfer heat to the LFPG heat reservoirs through recirculation of cryogenic heat transfer fluids. <br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a LFPG ETCS that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />The following outline the performance requirements for the LFPG ETCS:<br />1. Operating temperature range - The ETCS shall be capable of operating continuously at any setpoint temperature between 0 &deg;C and -120 &deg;C. The ETCS shall also be capable of repeatedly operating between + 25 &deg;C and 0 &deg;C on startup, without damage to the ETCS. The LFPG does not normally operate at temperatures above the ice point, but must operate in the startup range for several hours when each time LFPG operation commences.<br />2. Temperature Stability - The temperature stability of the ETCS shall be less than &plusmn; 0.1 &deg;C, as measured in the heat transfer fluid at the inlet to the LFPG vacuum chamber.
<p>3. Heat transfer fluid - The ETCS shall transfer heat to / from the LFPG using a cryogenic heat transfer fluid (HTF), with an appropriate specific heat and volumetric flow rate to meet the slewing rate specification in 4.</p>
<p>4. Slewing Rate - The ETCS shall change the temperature setpoint at a minimum slew rate of 1 &deg;C per minute, in both cooling and heating directions, as measured within the copper saturator of the LFPG. The minimum slew rate applies throughout the entire temperature range specified in 1 and 2. For the purposes of calculating slew rate and determining relevant component sizes, the ETCS will be cooling / heating approximately 68 kg of OFHC copper (the LFPG saturator), housed within a vacuum chamber. Two parallel passageways, approximately 150 inches in length, with square cross-section (3/8 inch per side) are located at the top and bottom of the cylindrical copper mass, for the purpose of effecting heat exchange between the HTF and the copper. The estimated heat leakage from the lab environment to the copper through the chamber wall is approximately 20W at -100 &deg;C. The estimated heat loading on the saturator from a secondary control system consisting of peltier heat pumps is 50W. Proper component sizing shall include sufficient factor of safety to insure successful attainment of item 11.</p>
<p>5. Heat transfer loop plumbing scheme - The following specifications for the HTF flow loop shall be met:</p>
<p>a) The HTF flow loop shall be constructed from double-walled, stainless-steel, evacuated tubing designed for pumping cryogenic fluids. <br />b) The HTF shall include connection fittings compatible with the existing bulkhead fittings on the LFPG vacuum chamber. These are metal face-sealed fittings, such as Swagelok VCR.<br />c) No in-line shutoff or throttling valves are permissible within the HTF loop. <br />d) The circulation pump shall be designed for cryogenic service. <br />e) The pump motor shall be replaceable without removing the pump from the HTF flow loop. <br />f) The HTF flow loop shall be closed and under sufficient pressure to prevent pump cavitation at high temperatures. <br />g) The HTF flow loop shall include a header tank designed to accommodate thermal expansion of the cryogenic fluid over the temperature range specified in 1 and 2. <br />h) The HTF flow loop will contain provisions for safe and complete recovery of the cryogenic fluid in the event that the flow loop must be opened for service.</p>
<p>6. Refrigeration scheme- Electro-mechanical refrigeration systems for cooling the HTF are envisioned within the ETCS. Multiple refrigeration systems optimized for different subsets of the operating temperature range are permissible. Cryogenic assist is permissible at low temperatures. In the event that multiple systems are employed, any cascading or switching between systems shall be performed automatically, without the need for human intervention. Chilled water is available for removing heat from refrigerants after compression.</p>
<p>7. Working voltage - Available line voltage is 120V, 208 V single phase, and 208 V 3-phase.</p>
<p>8. Heating scheme - electric heaters are envisioned for raising the temperature of the HTF. These heaters may be used for fine-temperature tuning / control of the HTF. The use of heaters within the ETCS shall be fully automatic, requiring no human intervention.</p>
<p>9. System configuration and layout - The ECTS is intended for use in a laboratory environment. While parts of the ECTS may be shielded or closed for various reasons, enclosure from an aesthetics point of view is not necessary. It is more important that items be located in optimal positions for proper heat transfer, drainage of liquids, separation of oil from refrigerants, serviceability, etc. System layout and configuration shall be compatible with existing laboratory space.</p>
<p>10. Human Machine Interface and system control - The ECTS shall be controlled via LabView-driven FPGA. There shall be an included touch-screen display for input of necessary operational commands and display of salient data, such as setpoint and process temperature. The control system shall include connections for an external computer, such that changes to the control system may be easily accomplished. LabView drivers must be furnished by the contractor.</p>
<p>11. Installation and testing - Manufacturer shall install and test the ETCS, with assistance from NIST personnel.</p>
<p>12. Training - Manufacturer shall train NIST personnel in use of the ETCS.</p>
<p>13. Documentation - The ETCS shall be sufficiently documented such that NIST personnel are capable of changing control parameters as needed to fine-tune the system, and so that NIST personnel may service the system, where possible.</p>
<p>14. Alternative Technical Approaches - While we envision the use of more than one refrigeration system acting on a single recirculation system, we are open to other approaches, provided that they can be sufficiently justified on a technical basis.</p>

<DESC>Description<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to serve as Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Centers (SCCC) for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) in coordinating, monitoring and supporting large scale, multi-site Phase I, II, III and IV contraceptive trials designed to evaluate systematically the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs and devices. The results of these clinical trials would be the bases for advancing candidate drugs and devices through development with the ultimate goal of submission to the FDA in support of a New Drug Application (NDA), Premarket notification 510k, Premarket Approval (PMA) or Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE).</p>
<p>The NICHD Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several pre-clinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis. To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN), which initially consisted of nine sites, in order to conduct clinical trials of new contraceptive methods.<br /><br />The CCTN is an important component of the Contraceptive and Reproductive Health Branch's contraceptive development capability. Products that have undergone formulation and successful pre-clinical testing, either through CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise:</p>
<p>1. The qualifications and abilities of the organization's staff in the coordination and monitoring of large scale, multi-site Phase I, II, III, and IV contraceptive clinical trials designed to evaluate systematically the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs and devices for advancing them through development with the ultimate goal of submission to the FDA in support of an New Drug Application (NDA), Premarket notification 510k, Premarket Approval (PMA) or Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE). Demonstrate experience of proposed staff in the development of research protocols, onsite monitoring of clinical trials, and the statistical analysis of data from these trials.</p>
<p>2. The organization's experience and ability to implement a quality control system for monitoring clinical, laboratory, and data collection procedures, with timely feedback to the individual clinical sites. Demonstrate experience and ability to implement an on-line web based (or at a minimum web enabled) data management system for collection, checking, editing, analyzing and correcting data from individual sites.</p>
<p>3. The organization's experience and availability of necessary personnel to participate in protocol review, protocol development, logistical support for meetings and conference calls, advise the CCTN Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), and ancillary services in support of contraceptive clinical trials.</p>

Request for Information: VA-701-12-I- 0012

I. Introduction: 
This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement. 

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for TV Recruitment Commercial.  At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

II. Background: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Workforce Management and Consulting Office (WMCO), Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) are responsible for promoting the VHA's The Best Care-The Best Careers. VHA desires to continue to run television recruitment commercials on both national broadcast networks and cable in order to better reach hard-to-recruit health care occupations; primarily Physicians, Registered Nurses and Pharmacists. Television recruitment gives HRRO the ability to target shows that attract health care providers and those who influence them through word of mouth. 

III. Requirements: 
The purpose of this project is to allow the offeror to propose and price a solution that meets both the recruitment and technical requirements for the proposed continuance of the VHA TV Recruitment Commercial campaign. VHA desires to create a greater awareness and knowledge of VHA and VAcareers.va.gov.  Methods are to make a large media buy that will reach all markets. This should include both national broadcast and cable networks during primetime with multiple runs including Spanish channels using existing Spanish Version spot, helping VHA to better recruit hard-to-reach health care occupations; primarily Physicians, Registered Nurses and Pharmacists. VHA seeks a near term impact and awareness of "The Best Care-The Best Careers" message followed with additional runs to expand and continue coverage.

VHA desires to purchase a large media buy that will create a large "splash" of awareness for VHA and VAcareers.va.gov.  This should include broadcast and cable networks during primetime and other times of high viewership targeted to critical Healthcare providers and influencers with multiple runs. Continuing advertisement shall be followed with flighted purchases for sustainment awareness.  VHA seeks a near term impact and awareness of "The Best Care-The Best Careers" message. Development of supporting marketing material is included and an important part of this project. Firms should have experience and ability to bring added negotiation and bargaining power to include existing PSA use air time with most media buys.

Media Placement

Criteria for the media buy include:
Run TV recruitment commercials on both National Broadcast networks and Cable in order to better reach difficult to fill healthcare occupations; primarily physicians, registered nurses and pharmacists. National broadcast reaches more homes than cable, in that they are available to 30 percent of people who don't subscribe to cable.  Television allows the ability to target shows that attract healthcare providers in their occupational and life interest areas and those who influence through word of mouth.  

The contractor must ensure maximum coverage of VA Careers advertising dollars.  Negotiated media buys shall maximize added value for existing VA Careers television commercials in best-value viewership venues and shows at best-value times as defined in government-approved; contractor-provided media plans and agreements.

"Placed" means that the advertisement actually runs (e.g., the commercial appears on a broadcast television network or approved social media.  All media buy placements shall be preapproved by VA.  Placements will not be aired in shows of controversial topics or those considered offensive or unprofessional.  Placement and runs shall meet the following objectives:
Ensure broadest reach to ALL markets (e.g., minority to include Hispanic and Native Americans; metro and rural; and college markets)
Ensure ability to reach diversity markets, including, Veteran, Hispanic and Native American 
Ensure primetime positioning on top networks
Enhance VHA recruitment efforts through greater name recognition nationally
HRRO or its supplier shall provide existing television commercials to the contractor for the placement.  Generally, the media used will be cable/local TV for optimum exposure.

Develop Creative Material for Supplemental On-line Media Placement 
The contractor shall develop a library of promotional, educational, communications, marketing and implementation materials and tools to market the VA Careers program through the VHA Web Communications Office which includes social media outlets such as Face Book, YouTube, Second Life, MySpace, etc.  The contractor has flexibility to recommend other on-line venues subject to advance approval by the VHA Web Communications Office through HRRO.  The tools and materials shall be designed to educate, inform, and inspire users to 
Generate excitement among VHA staff increasing overall employee morale, possibly increasing referrals

Supporting paid online media will target local VHA organizational needs and allow a greater reach into minority, rural and college markets.   Care will be taken to ensure that (1) the appropriate message is sent that portrays truth in advertising and daily life at VHA and (2) that the public will view the campaign as professional, necessary and a good value for the resources spent.   All formats shall be in open-source usable to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Employee Education System (EES). 

Monitoring, Reporting and Cost Control The contractor is responsible for tracking costs and monitoring each media buy.

The contractor shall make available proof-of-performance documents at all times, and upon request of HRRO.  The contractor shall maintain copies of all documentation for purposes of audit as required by the task order and other Federal statutes.  Upon task order completion, these documents will be turned over to the government (HRRO) where they will be maintained for five years from the date the final invoice was paid. 

Media Plan  
The contractor shall develop a media plan that effectively addresses the goals of this Performance Work Statement.  The Contractor shall draft a Media Plan that lays out the Contractor's approach, timeline and tools to be used in execution of the contract.  The plan should take the form of both a narrative and graphic format that displays the schedule, milestones, risks and resource support.

<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS BEING RELEASED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND SERVES TO BENEFIT THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES AND INDUSTRY FEEDBACK TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THE m-FoCS REQUIREMENT WILL BE SOLICITED ON A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BASIS IN A FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER THE SOLICITATION NUMBER W15P7T-12-R-0001.<br><br>DRAFT VERSIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR THE m-FoCS HAVE BEEN ATTACHED FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ACCEPT INDUSTRY FEEDBACK AND/OR QUESTIONS FOR TEN (10) CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE POSTING OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE. ALL QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT LATER THAN TEN (10) CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE CLOSING PERIOD FOR SUBMISSION OF FEEDBACK.      <br><br>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission. Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission. Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions. Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/output and communications devices and installations kits within a command vehicle have reached the saturation point. The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern. The m-FoCS hardware (referred to as Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P) in prior presolicitation announcements) is a means to alleviate these concerns.<br>

BACKGROUND</strong>: In the past year, provisions of the HiTECH Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act have new requirements for the use of data in design of health benefits; comparison of quality, cost, and outcomes; evaluation of population health outcomes in the context of health care delivery system design; and many more. It is anticipated that use of modeling and simulation platforms will be in high demand for policy makers and researchers, and ultimately, health care providers, to develop better situational awareness, and relevance of their own information to modeled populations. Refer to attached RFI for further information.</p>
<p><strong>4. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</strong> HHS is seeking the use of a modeling and simulation platforms and software services that can be used in a variety of research and policy applications for health and health care.

<DESC>General Information
<p>Document Type: Sources Sought Notice<br />Solicitation Number: H-65<br />Posted Date: Oct 21, 2011<br />Original Response Date: Dec 16, 2011<br />Current Response Date: Dec 16, 2011<br />Original Archive Date: Feb 2, 2012<br />Current Archive Date: Feb 2, 2012<br />Classification Code: 16 -- Aircraft components &amp; accessories<br />NAICS Code: 336413 -- Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (USCG), Commanding Officer, USCG Aviation Logistics Center, H65, Elizabeth City, NC, 27909-5001, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description<br />H-65 Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS); Request for information<br />This is not a request for proposals. This is a Request for Information (RFI) released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is offering a proposed AFCS specification for industry comment. This is intended to be an opportunity for qualified vendors to provide suggestions to improve the specification that will be included in the MH-65E AFCS acquisition project.</p>
<p>The H-65 avionics system modernization plan includes the incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). The AFCS will be integrated with the proven flight director in CAAS. A draft AFCS system specification is attached for review. Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the attached document and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>Please respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Company Profile (1) Is your business a large or small business? <br />(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? <br />(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? <br />(4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? <br />(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? <br />(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?<br />GSA and Product Users (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? <br />(9) Do you have other (non-government) customers using the product, and if so please provide POCs and contract numbers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this RFI announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this RFI are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than 16 December at 3 p.m. EST. This notice is intended to provide interested parties with an opportunity to improve the H-65 specification only. All firms responding to this request for information are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this RFI are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p>Point of Contact</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is publishing this request for information and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers. Suggestions must be received at the following address no later than 16 December 2011.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer<br />Attn: AFCS<br />H-65 Product Line Division<br />USCG Aviation Logistics Center <br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001</p>
<p>Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line "H-65 AFCS Comments, Company Name". Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the contracting officer, the Coast Guard may quote all or part of any suggestions or questions received in future correspondence regarding the AFCS acquisition. The original author will not be identified.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the AFCS technical specification and acquisition planning for the H-65.</p>
<p>Additional Project Details</p>
<p>1.0 Scope<br />The AFCS may be installed in all H-65 aircraft. The requirement will include spares. The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />The Coast Guard currently operates (102) H-65 aircraft. The aircraft is in the process of being upgraded by incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).</p>
<p>The H-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft. The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3. The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards. Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.</p>
<p>2.1 Technical Data<br />The Coast Guard has limited data rights for the H-65 aircraft. Design data available for the AFCS integration has been developed through measurement and test. In addition to the system specification, the final acquisition package will include mechanical interface drawings and an aerodynamic model.</p>
<p>2.2 Schedule<br />The current plan is to issue a request for proposals in the 2nd quarter of FY12 with first article delivery in early FY13.</p>
<p>3.0 Modernization Planning</p>
<p>The H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components. The system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI) and a HG7210CA01 RADAR Altimeter system (RADALT). The flight management system will be incorporated in the Collins CDU-7000 and other processors.</p>
<p>The AFCS will be fully integrated with the flight management system. The complete system will be capable of full control of all axes of flight from a stable hover to flight and back to a stable hover at a designated position.</p>
<p>AFCS mode annunciation will be incorporated into the CAAS display system. All lighting, displays, controls and indicators will be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.</p>
<p>For planning purposes, it should be assumed that the AFCS will be certified under FAR 29. However, the Coast Guard will work in partnership with NAVAIR for the airworthiness certification.</p>
<p>3.1 Support<br />A Support By the Hour (SBH) support strategy is desired. The support requirement will be based on existing Coast Guard support contracts. The support requirement will be included in the system acquisition documents. System performance parameters offered in response to the solicitation will be incorporated into required performance in the support contract. The support contract will include performance guarantees in the form of liquidated damages related to Coast Guard availability targets.</p>
<p>3.2 Open Architecture<br />The AFCS will be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols. The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems. Data developed at government expense will be used by the government without restriction.</p>
<p>3.3 Integration<br />The Coast Guard will integrate the AFCS into the MH-65E airframe. The AFCS supplier will be required to support the integration effort. The final request for proposals will include a government managed development and certification plan. The government will provide and operate a test aircraft complete with flight test instrumentation. Potential suppliers will be provided with an opportunity to offer alternative plans that would reduce cost and delivery time for the government.</p>
<p>4. Vendor Qualification<br />The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer for AFCS. The supplier must have been approved by the US Department of Defense (DOD) or GSA (or equivalent as determined by the best value source selection team) as an aircraft AFCS supplier or have been included as part of an approved supplemental type certificate for installation of AFCS on US commercial aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>The supplier must have experience working with civil and military airworthiness authorities.</p>
<p>The supplier must have or establish a permanent presence in the United States staffed with English speaking technical support personnel. All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation<br />After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.</p>
<p>Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.</p>
<p>The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price. Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.</p>
<p>The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced. An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>6. Industry Day<br />The H-65 Conversion Sustainment Project will host an AFCS Industry Day for all interested vendors on 16 November 2011 at the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, NC. The Industry Day will provide a forum for both the government and industry to receive feedback and obtain clarifications on AFCS specifications. The event will also provide the opportunity for vendors to acquaint themselves with an MH-65C which will be available for orientation and measurements. <br />The AFCS Industry Day will be held at the Aviation Logistics Center at Coast Guard Station Elizabeth City: Building 75, 1664 Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909 from 0900 to 1600 EST. Directions to the Coast Guard Station can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/alc/directions.asp. Registration will begin at 0845 EST. Please allow 15 minutes for security screening required to enter Coast Guard Station Elizabeth City. <br />The event is open to both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals. Interested vendors are required to register for the event by emailing the attached registration form to Jeffrey.C.Henkel@uscg.mil by October 28, 2011. Please only send one registration request per vendor, including a maximum of four (4) representatives. Please indicate if any special accommodations for disabilities are required. Government issued photo ID (i.e. driver's license) will be required for admittance.<br />While the event will not be webcast, a summary of the event, including all presentations and questions, will be posted to this announcement within 2 weeks of the event. <br />A schedule* of presentations/events planned for the Industry Day includes: <br />&#61607; Project History &amp; Overview<br />&#61607; Requirement Description<br />&#61607; Project Organization<br />&#61607; Recent Program Documentation<br />&#61607; Project Schedule<br />&#61607; Specification Roundtable Discussion<br />&#61607; H-65 Demo</p>

<DESC>This announcement is released by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, New Jersey to provide notification of an Industry Day event to be held Tuesday November 15, 2011 through Thursday November 17, 2011 at the MITRE Corporation facilities, located at 1550 Westbranch Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102. The overall objective of this event is to provide information and augment VA's market research for the upcoming acquisition supporting the Facilities Management Transformation Initiative (VAFM) for web-based commercially available and hosted construction project management capabilities.  VA's intent is to solicit input and expertise from industry leaders in enterprise construction project and construction contract management software capabilities. Software vendors with this experience and expertise are invited to attend the VAFM Industry Day.  For market research purposes in support any resulting acquisition, the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512, with a small business size standard of $25 million.
	
The purpose of the VAFM initiative is to assist VA with meeting its goal to provide a centralized enterprise level construction and facilities management system for construction management from conception through construction warranty period or other significant milestones; provide automated tools to support reporting requirements as defined by VA Management; eliminate duplication of effort in data entry and management; and promote consistent implementation of business rules for construction and facilities management. VAFM is a part of the Department's Establish Strong VA Management Infrastructure and Integrated Operating Model Major Initiative. 


The event will begin with the VA presenting an overview of their VAFM Initiative and plans for construction project management (CPM).  This is the ONLY session that will be open to all participants.  After the initial session the VA will invite vendors to present demonstrations of their existing construction project and construction contract management software product capabilities in one-on-one sessions with the VA.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p>H.21 <strong>CONSULTANTS<br /><br /></strong>A.&nbsp; Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</span></p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />&#350;ahin Yildiran<br />Research and Development Manager<br />Enerjisa Ba&#351;kent Electricity Distribution Company<br />Ba&#351;kent Plaza<br />Ehlibeyt Mahallesi Ceyhun Atuf<br />Kansu Cad. No: 106<br />06520 Balgat-&Ccedil;ankaya /Ankara<br />Republic of Turkey<br />Tel: 0312 573 56 02<br />Fax: 0312 573 50 30</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to integrate supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems with its current and planned information technology (IT) systems, including its geographic information system (GIS), Workforce Management System, Customer Information System and Call Center. The study will include a gap analysis, strategy proposal, estimate of investment needed and system integration recommendations.</p>
<p>Turkey is facing a potentially crippling electricity shortage due to rising demand in the midst of a bustling economic environment. In order to function more efficiently and avoid hindering economic growth, the Government of Turkey is encouraging distribution companies to implement strategies that reduce losses to the grid, which currently average 14.5% per year, or more than double the 5.9% losses that occur in the United States. Accordingly, distribution companies are seeking improved control systems, automation and other smart grid techniques to reduce losses and increase energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The Grantee is highly motivated to introduce smart grid techniques that would modernize its distribution operations and allow the company to meet growing electric power needs in its service territory. The Grantee is one of twenty regional companies that were privatized last year, and the management intends to be the leader in the Turkish electricity market as an integrated utility. The company's service territory includes over 3 million customers, covering the capital city Ankara and six other regions: K&#305;r&#305;kkale, Zonguldak, Bart&#305;n, Karab&uuml;k, &Ccedil;ank&#305;r&#305;, and Kastamonu. The company has set an ambitious target to command a 10% market share providing 5,000 MW of power and serving 6 million customers by the year 2015.</p>
<p>The Grantee has already made initial steps to incorporate elements of a smart grid system into its distribution network. The Grantee has assigned the highest priority to extend its SCADA system to cover its remaining distribution substations and to implement other smart-grid solutions, in order to improve operational performance of the electricity distribution network and to connect to the wider European system. This Study will assist the Grantee to expand upon its smart grid efforts by developing a detailed 5-year plan and budget based upon recommended upgrades in the study. Linking state-of-the-art ICT technology throughout the distribution network in Turkey promises tremendous enhancement of reliability, capacity and customer service in Turkey's electricity sector, and this study would significantly reduce the risk of unmet demand that threatens to hinder Turkey's economic development.</p>
<p>The objective of the Study is to analyze how the Grantee can integrate its SCADA systems with their current and planned IT systems. The Study will allow the Grantee to incorporate IT tools with its control centers, distribution networks, and all of the interactions among these parts. The seamless capability of these systems to "talk" to each other is the foundational step necessary for a smart business approach to efficient utility business management.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $201,606 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, LOCAL TIME, OCTOBER 27, 2011, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort. This acquisition has been Set Aside for Small Business. Only small businesses, qualifying under NAICS Code 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services" (gross receipts averaging not more than $25 million annually for the past three years) will be eligible for award
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

<DESC>Description: Military Sealift Command intends to issue a contract on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) to Photo Measurement Solutions, LLC for the following requirement:
<p>The LCC 20 USS MOUNT WHITNEY will be undergoing an electrical upgrade in which two (2) new Ship Service Diesel Generators (SSDGs) will be installed adjacent to the existing one. Major modifications must be done to the existing spaces on-board the vessel where the SSDGs will be located and where the new exhaust trunks will run. To help plan the modifications of these spaces, MSC requires a 3-D AutoCAD model of the spaces as they exist now.</p>
<p>Under the requirements of the Contract, the Contractor shall provide&nbsp;for professional photogrammetry services to conduct a digital photographic survey of several internal spaces of the ship, followed by the processing and conversion of those photos to create a 3-D model in AutoCAD format showing the layout of those spaces (to include everything in each space, i.e. pipes, structure, bulkheads, machinery, pumps, tanks, lights, deck, overhead, wiring, HVAC ducting, intake and exhaust piping, etc.). The contractor must have experience with successful modeling of shipboard interior spaces. The method the Contractor uses to do this shall not interfere with the operation of the ship, ship's personnel, or running of machinery, as this task will be completed while the ship is undergoing an availability in the shipyard. There will be personnel working in the designated spaces, and they must not be interrupted or interfered with. To ensure this, the Contractor shall use a non-targeted data acquisition process to perform the photogrammetry services; therefore, physical reflective targets used for measurement references (or any other type of physical measurement reference tools) shall not be placed on the objects being measured. Due to the ongoing work being accomplished on-board the ship during the shipyard, there could be high temperatures, excessive vibration variations or interruption of electrical power that cannot be controlled; therefore, the photogrammetry tools (scanner, digital camera, etc.) used must be able to withstand these environmental factors. Due to the time constraints of the availability of the ship for shipcheck and the need for these 3-D models for modifications to take place on the vessel, the Contractor shall expedite both the data acquisition process while onboard the vessel and the time to deliver the final product to MSC. The Contractor shall provide 3-D models in AutoCAD format of six (6) spaces on-board the vessel.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance for the Contract will begin upon acceptance of the Contract and end no later than 30 December 2011.<br /><br />NOTE: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by MSC.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: THIS NOTICE IS MARKET RESEARCH TO SUPPORT INCLUSION OF A SOLE SOURCE (BRAND NAME) SPECIFICATION IN VARIOUS FY12 and FY13 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS&nbsp;to be procured under NAICS 236220.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The U.S. Army Engineer District, Alaska intends to specify the below listed item as part of larger construction contracts to be executed on various military installations throughout the State of Alaska. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Reference FAR 6.302-1(c), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".
<p>ITEM: Intelligent Parking Lot Controllers (ILPC) from Intelligent Parking Lot Controller Corp. of Manitoba, Canada. THIS NOTICE IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No solicitation will be available as this sole source item will be incorporated into the specifications of FY12 solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) facilities throughout Alaska. The ILPC is a smart power receptacle which controls the amount of power supplied to engine block heaters that are used to warm engines in cold climate environments. The IPLC has a microprocessor that controls the flow of power to the block heater according to several factors including temperature, wind chill and time. The IPLC is factory programmed to automatically regulate optimum power flow to ensure strong engine starts at any temperature. By not supplying constant power, the intelligent operation reduces energy consumption costs by up to 65 percent. Each IPLC handles two outlets and each can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters or to meet the special needs of diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Red/green LEDs instantly indicate the status of the power outlet and user equipment including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open or short circuit in the block heater or a circuit overload from an in-car heater. <br /><br />Salient features of the IPLC include: <br />A. Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature, wind chill and time. <br />B. Totally programmable via computer software to vary the amount of electricity supplied based on temperature.<br />C. Built-in microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with or without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor.<br />D. Able to identify problems with open circuit or circuit overload via LEDs or other means.<br />E. Operates within a temperature range of -60C to 55C.</p>
<p>Vendors who offer similar products are invited to respond to this notice. Responses must include the following information:<br />(1) Identification of the manufacturer's name, address, and country of product manufacture.<br />(2) Fully detailed specification sheets. <br />(3) Narrative addressing how your product meets the salient features listed.</p>

<a href="mailto:Sara.Kessler@va.gov">Industry Day Point of Contact</a>
<DESC>****This amendment is to extend the registration deadline for the Industry Day from October 21, 2011 to October 26, 2011*****
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a critical need for an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS).  In support of VA Transformation Initiative Health Care Efficiency, the RTLS solution shall support the objectives of focused clinical and administrative process efficiency and total asset visibility.  The mission of the RTLS Program is to provide multiple technologies to include Wi-Fi based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, such as ultrasound and infrared when a Wi-Fi based solution is not feasible. These technologies will be used to track the location and flow of assets and people, as well as monitoring factors, such as temperature.  These capabilities can result in the design of more optimal processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, reductions in staff hours spent searching for equipment, and the ability to maintain more accurate less expensive inventory levels within VA.  The purpose of the RTLS solution is to improve the efficiency of targeted business processes in its hospitals, clinics, offices and cemeteries to support the missions of Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and other VA entities.  
Industry Day: The purpose of this specific announcement is to inform interested firms that VA Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) - Austin has scheduled an Industry Day Conference on November 8, 2011 from 8:00 am to 2:30 pm (CT) in Austin, TX.  The Industry Day Conference will be held at the Wyndham Garden Hotel & Woodward Conference Center, located at 3401 South IH-35, Austin, TX 78745.  The purpose of the Industry Day Conference is to provide preliminary information on VA's anticipated technical requirements, business/contract considerations, acquisition approach and sub-contracting information.  The Industry Day Conference will also provide an opportunity for contractors to ask questions and for interested firms to network with each other. 
One-on-One Sessions: Following the Industry Day Conference, VA will host thirty-minute one-on-one meetings with contractors on November 8th and 9th.  The one-on-one sessions will be held at the South Park One building, located at 1701 Directors Boulevard, Suite 600, Floor 6.  VA is hosting one-on-one meetings with the intent of allowing each contractor the opportunity to express their technical, contractual and procedural concerns in regards to the RTLS program, requirements, and acquisition strategy.  The one-on-one meetings are limited to two representatives per firm, but four representatives per teaming arrangement or joint venture.  Participants are not permitted to bring any sort of marketing materials to the one-on-one meetings.  
Registration Requirements:  Companies of all sizes are invited, but you must be registered to attend.  A maximum of two representatives per company will be allowed, until the maximum seating capacity of 275 is reached.  Instructions for registration and Industry Day information (briefings, list of attendees and follow up Q&A) will be posted to the following website:  https://www.voa.va.gov.  Please continue to check the website periodically for updates and additional information.  The Industry Day and one-on-one contractor meetings registration deadline is October 26, 2011 by 2:00 pm (CT).  Please note, attendance/participation at the Industry Day Conference is encouraged, but is not a prerequisite for participation in any solicitation that may eventually result from the conference.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred for attending the Industry Day Conference.  
This announcement is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract(s).  No solicitations exist at this time.
All questions regarding the Industry Day Conference should be directed in writing via email to Sara Kessler at Sara.Kessler@va.gov.

<DESC>The registration date has been extended from Friday, October 21, 2011 to Friday, October 28, 2011. <br /><br />The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)), Office of Technical Intelligence (OTI) will host an Industry Day on Monday, October 31, 2011 from 12:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. for the Technology Watch and Horizon Scanning (TW/HS) Conceptual Framework Project.&nbsp; The Industry Day will be held in Arlington, VA.&nbsp; The exact address will be provided to all registered participants.&nbsp; Due to space limitations, each organization is limited to no more than two representatives for the event.&nbsp; Registration will be discontinued after the maximum limit of participants has been reached.&nbsp; No walk-in registration will be permitted.<br /><br />The purpose of the TW/HS Industry Day is to inform attendees about OTI goals, encourage collaboration, and provide information about the proposal process.&nbsp; <br /><br />The scope of the TW/HS Project consists of developing a conceptual framework to unite numerous technology forecasting analysis products, approaches and insights that ASD(R&amp;E) commissions and receives every year.&nbsp; The volume of this type of information is steadily increasing, while the amount of time that people have to review it is decreasing.&nbsp; A process and system for automating at least part of the review and distillation of this information is necessary for ASD(R&amp;E) to achieve and maintain a decision advantage in the future.&nbsp; The conceptual framework will provide a construct in which to produce and analyze technology forecasts and, perhaps more importantly, will lay the groundwork for a semi-automated system in the future. <br /><br />The event is open to all potential offerors, including those that have performed or are performing work with OTI and new contractors that are interested in doing business with OTI.&nbsp; All interested organizations are encouraged to attend.<br /><br />To register for the Industry Day, please email <a href="mailto:julie.fox@whs.mil">julie.fox@whs.mil</a> with the following information by 10:00 a.m. on Friday, October 28, 2011:

<DESC>The existing DESIGO software is a proprietary software system of the Siemens Corporation and is used to generate the Energy Management Control System (EMCS).  There are no other known sources at the present time that can provide the required software service update.  The DPW EMCS has recently been combined into an integrated and supervised platform controlled with Siemens-DESIGO software.  In order to maintain continuity and operability, the update of the existing DESIGO is required.  Due to the proprietary nature and because Siemens is the only vendor that can provide an economical upgrade the software upgrade must be subcontracted to the Siemens-DESIGO to insure a seamless integration.
