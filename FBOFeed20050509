<DESC>“Improved Health of Bolivians – Strengthening Clinical Services and Health Systems Management” RFP Pre-Solicitation.

This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by July 30, 2004.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a program described below.  Under a new Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG) being negotiated between USAID/Bolivia and the Government of Bolivia, USAID will support a triad of activities to strengthen capacity within the decentralized public sector health care system.  Through PROSIN II, a project implementation unit within the Ministry of Health, USAID will support policy development, health systems oversight, service coordination, and strategic leadership within the central and departmental levels of the public health sector.  

To improve clinic-based health service delivery and management capacity at the local level (health networks and municipalities), USAID will solicit a Contractor to provide technical assistance, training, and logistical support.  The Contractor’s activities will focus on four priority components: (1) Management Capacity-Building to strengthen  the capacity of local health networks to manage decentralized health services in accordance with national policies and standards, and to promote management capacity at central and departmental health levels and among USAID-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as requested; (2) Quality and Coverage of Clinical Health Services to ensure that local health networks have the tools and competencies to assure the delivery of a basic package of quality services for improved child health and nutrition, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and reproductive health, and to provide similar specialized technical assistance to other USAID-funded implementing partners as needed; (3) Municipal Matching Funds to be designed and managed in support of Local Health Plans and improved quality of health services; and (4) Additional Support Services to provide procurement planning and services, as well as logistical support, for selected USAID-funded implementing partners and activities.  To successfully implement these activities, the Contractor must have significant capacity in providing technical assistance in management of health care systems as well as expertise in improving the quality of clinical health care services.

Important cross-cutting themes which must be integrated into the design and implementation of the Contractor’s activities include: responsiveness to the unique multicultural context of Bolivia, redressing gender inequities in health, and institutionalizing local capacity-building skills.  The Contractor will be expected to model such desired outcomes in its organizational structure, cultural and gender diversity of the staffing plan, and implementation of specific and measurable strategies to promote local technical assistance capacity.

Through another mechanism, USAID/Bolivia will also support improved community-based health services.  Including PROSIN II, this triad of partners under the SOAG will coordinate their activities in selected municipalities to achieve the desired results of (1) increased ability of individuals, families, and communities to take action to improve health, (2) expanded delivery if quality, high-impact services through health networks, and (3) strengthened institutional capacity for health care management and sustainability.   

It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), completion type contract will be awarded for implementation of the four priority components specified above.  Implementation will occur over a 5 year period.  USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified Offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  The Mission anticipates issuing the RFP o/a August 10, 2004.  Proposal due date will be October 11, 2004.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

The UAV Battlelab invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative UAV concepts.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984".  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 99 CONS/LGCC, marked for BAA UAVB-05-001, 5865 Swaab Blvd Bldg 588 Nellis AFB, NV 89191-7063.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to david.huber@nellis.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.   Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 APR 06.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offers should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The mission of the UAV Battlelab is to rapidly identify and demonstrate innovative concepts which exploit the unique characteristics of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs) and UAVs to meet the warfighter’s needs.

It is focused in two areas: combat applications and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).     

This BAA requests concept papers to identify material and non-materiel solutions to improve UAVs’ abilities to meet warfighter’s needs.     

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         

Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the UAV Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 

D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA UAVB-05-001 with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Capt Huber at (702) 652-3366 or email to: david.huber@nellis.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this program.

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.    However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages each, of the proposed concept to Capt Huber at the address in cited in this BAA (see the Points of Contact information in Section G of this BAA).  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance UAV operations.

Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish the demonstration.

Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology. 

Section E: Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training.

Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration. 

Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 

Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact current telephone number and address.  For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.  Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) The extent to which the proposed concept enhances UAV operations, 

(b) Impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities (Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, Agile Combat Support), 

(c) Technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, and 

(d) Proposed cost.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a one-year base period, plus four pre-priced one-year options.  The base period will run from 01 October 2005 to 30 September 2006.  Option Year One is from 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007.  Option Year Two is from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2008.  Option Year Three is from 1 October 2008 through 30 September 2009.  Option Year Four is from 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2010.  The requirement is for bird management and control services to eliminate or minimize bird hazards for safe air and ground support operations at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.  These measures may include, but are not limited to, the use of border collies, radio controlled model airplanes, harassment, trapping, relocation, depredation, airfield/airdrome patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring.   The Government will provide an on-base facility and two government-owned transceivers for communication with Control Tower and Airfield Management.  National Agency Checks will be required for employees requiring access to the Local Area Network.    The NAICS code is 561710 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) $6,000,000.00.  In accordance with FAR 19.1300, this solicitation will be issued as a 100% HubZone set-aside.   Evaluation for award will be Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 13 April 2005 and will close on or about 16 May 2005.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.    IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Chuck Peck (302) 677-3744, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at Charles.Peck@dover.af.mil.

This procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 333111 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The subject Request for Proposals (RFPs) incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13. Scope:  This purchase description establishes the performance requirements for the USMC Hydro Seeders.  The Marine Corps is interested in procuring two variants of the Hydro Seeders, Trailer mounted and Skid mounted.  Unless otherwise stated, all requirements refer to both variants.  Intended Use of Hydro Seeders:  The Hydro Seeders will be used to apply dust palliative agents to mitigate dusty environments in austere conditions.  Characteristics:  Trailer mounted Hydro Seeders must be maneuverable in soft sandy conditions.

The skid-mounted system must be capable of being mounted on the back of the MTVR vehicle (both the standard and long cargo bed variant).  The skid-mounted system is mounted, via the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) corner fittings on the bed of the MTVR vehicle.  The overall height of the skid-mounted unit shall not exceed 65 inches in the transportation mode.  The skid-mounted system shall also have fork pockets accessible by a forklift from the either side.  The fork pockets shall accept fork tines that are 72 inches long by 8 inches wide.  Forklifts will only handle skid-mounted systems when empty.  Both the trailer-mounted and skid-mounted systems shall have tiedown and lifting provisions (both crane and external hel! icopter lift).  Tiedown and lifting provisions shall meet testing criteria of MIL-STD-209J when transported at the empty weight of the system.  The tiedown provisions of the Hydro Seeder shall also meet testing criteria of MIL-STD-810F for rail impact test.

However, the price will be evaluated on a quantity of 25 units for both the trailer mounted and skid mounted units for each year.  Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (January 2005):  Multiple Offers are discouraged. Offerors shall submit a combined technical/business proposal as elements of their offer.  An original and three (3) written copies of the proposal are required.  Offerors may use product literature in their technical proposals; however, any ambiguities noted in the technical capability of the product may have an adverse impact on your evaluation.  The proposal shall be specific, detailed, and comprehensive enough to enable technical personnel to make a thorough evaluation of its content.  Proposals shall be prepared using "Arial" or "Times New Roman" 11-point font style on 8 1/2 x 11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 point! s.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material submitted may be single-spaced.  Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.  Page count for the combined technical/business proposal shall not exceed 35 total pages, inclusive of product literature.  Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) June 1, 2005:  COMMANDER, Attn:  Ms. Peggy L. Hake, CTQPLH, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester St., Quantico, VA 22134-5010.  NOTE:  Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors: Operational Effectiveness - Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in this purchase description and to deliver the appropriate quantities required herein by August 30, ! 2005.  Ensure that your stated response addresses overall product compatibility, as well as any additional features not specifically cited in the purchase description.  Address any specific commercial, or extended warranty provisions for the resulting product.  Provide evidence of product quality, any certifications for use, safety, and reliability in your proposal.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:  (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated.  Award shal! l be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider operational effectiveness and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representa! tions and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of!  your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into!  the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.2! 22-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18 Availability of Funds, 52.247-34  F.o.B. Destination. DFARS clauses: 252.211-7003, 252.204-7004, 252.212-7001, and 252.225-7000.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information avail! able at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center,  Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to solicit Smithers Scientific of  425 West Market Street, Akron, OH. 44303 on a sole source basis for a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Laboratory  Testing of Phase Two Materials Program. The skirt FCT program is essentially a two-phased program. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason.  Smithers Scientific has already performed the phase 1 testing, and needs to perform the phase 2 testing as well otherwise this will introduce uncertainty into the results.  A direct quantitative comparison needs to be obtained between the phase 1 and phase 2 materials.  If a different test lab performs the phase 2 tests, they may not directly compare to the phase 1 results.  It would be necessary for that lab to re-run all of the phase 1 tests to be sure of a direct comparison.  While this is possible, it would not be cost-effective.  Thus Smithers Scientific is only vendor th! at can meet this requirement.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 325212 Applies. SBA Size Standard is 500.

<CONTACT>Luis Maestas Contracting Officer 3032361832     Luis_Maestas@blm.gov;
<DESC>This project will be accomplished through the use of a stewardship contract, which authorizes the value of forest products to be applied as an offset against the cost of services received; and multi-year contract authority greater than five years but not to exceed ten years (Public Law 108-7).  The goal of this project is to increase the amount of defensible space on Federally-managed lands that are adjacent to the Hoback Ranches community to reduce the hazard of wildland fires spreading from Federally-managed lands to the Hoback Ranches community and from within the community to public lands. The project responds to goals and objectives of the National Fire Plan, Healthy Forest Restoration Act, and the Pinedale Resource Management Plan (RMP BLM 1988).  Hoback Ranches is identified as a Community-At-Risk and listed in the Federal Register on August 17, 2001 (66 FR 43384).  The wildland fire hazard is very high because of dense forest vegetation that is the result of fire exclusion; the buildup of standing dead, dying, and diseased trees; semi-continuous, heavy, downed, dead, woody material; ladder fuels; canopy spacing; topography in conifer forest stands; and the closeness of fuels to structures. This project will include the completion of the shaded fuel break, thinning, and forest heath treatments for up to 1150 acres over a 6-year period.  The remaining portion of the shaded fuel break is approximately 150 acres.  The shaded fuel break will be 300 feet wide and have a tree spacing of 20 feet between leave trees.  It is critical that all woody surface materials and ladder fuels be cleared within this shaded fuel break area.  Thinning will be conducted on approximately 600 acres along the shaded fuel break to increase its effectiveness.  Forest heath treatments will remove beetle killed, disease trees, conifer encroachment into aspen on approximately 400 acres.  See attached map for project area and specific task locations. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE - 	This is a multi year contract contemplated by Section 323 of P.L. 108-7, and as such may continue for a period of up to 10 years.  The period of performance for this contract will be from date of award to September 30, 2011.  In the event that the cost of the services exceeds the value of the timber products and or the appropriated funds, the cancellation dates required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 17.106-1 will be mutually arrived at.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for six months of meteorological data and four numerical weather prediction studies.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the data from AirDat, LLC as the only known source that can meet Agency Requirements. Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting(TAMDAR)sensors are installed on a regional airline fleet to collect  meteorological data. AirDat owns and controls the equipment and the intellectual content of the TAMDAR data. The data will be used to establish a system for collecting and disseminating weather conditions from aircraft operating below 25,000 ft, and will be used to improve aviation safety.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer similar data that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 20, 2005.

The scope of this work entails locating, analyzing, evaluating and fielding sensor systems that are integrated to airborne platforms. These sensors range in capability from simple cameras to complex radar and signals acquisition and direction finding equipment. Communications and data links from the platform to the ground station is a vital part of the asset as is the dissemination of the Intelligence products to the various enclaves. The support effort produces a viable approach to accommodate the demands of the community for Intelligence that is actionable and relevant. The scope of work behind the effort includes managing the vendor's claims against the physical practicalities by analysis and investigation. Often, there are alternate methods of obtaining a satisfactory sensor performance by including other functional modules that complement the basic function. For example, radar could be used to cue a camera to prosecute a target to the fullest extent of identification. The period of performance will be one base year from date of award and four (4) one year options.  This requirement is being procured as a Small Business Set Aside.  The resultant award is expected to be a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) time and materials contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  The primary work will be performed at a Government facility located west of the Washington D. C.

Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
Miami, Florida

The United States Government intends to award a succeeding lease, using other than full and open competition to Museum Tower, of Miami, Florida.  The lease will be for 27,310 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of five-years 

The Government has a continuing need for this space.  It has been determined that a succeeding lease will result in less cost to the Federal Government when the economics of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government’s intention to award this project under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Louise Long, Contracting Officer, at louisem.long@gsa.gov  or to her attention at GSA, Realty Services Division, Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Facilities Development and Operations (ORF), is seeking sources capable of providing all parts, material, installation tools, test equipment and labor for replacement, repairing, and testing of a 15 KV cable distribution system throughout the NIH main campus in Bethesda, Maryland. 

The 15KV cable system primarily consists of 3 Conductor Paper Insulated, Lead Covered, Jacketed (PILC) and Ethylene Polypropylene Rubber (EPR), 350 and/or 500 MCM cable(s).  Contractor must be able to perform the following three tasks:  

1)  Make emergency repairs involving the repair or replacement and testing of damaged cable, splices, switchgear, circuit breakers, or any other electrical components that are found to be defective.  Please note that emergencies occur 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365/366 days a year.   

2)  Scheduled cable replacement, which shall consist of the replacement of one feeder at a time, in its entirety, from source to final termination in various buildings, the break down and re-connection of splices, testing, and the removal of the old cable.  

3)  Provide technical assistance to NIH employees which may include locating faults, circuit analysis, trouble-shooting, power system analysis, and back-up High-Pot testing of cables.

The vast majority of cable replacement will require the contractor to supply its own cable.  Government furnished cable may be provided in limited situations.  Testing shall be completed per interNational Electrical Testing Association (NETA) Section 7 specifications.

Results of this Sources Sought announcement will be used to determine the best procurement method for this requirement.  Currently NIH intends to issue a solicitation for one base year and four one-year options at a total estimated value exceeding 3 million dollars.

Any potential contractors should respond with a capability statement by May 25, 2005 at 12:00pm EDT.  Capability statements must not be longer than 10 pages in length. Capability statements must reference similar work that has been performed by the contractor, the dollar value of that work, and contact information for references knowledgeable about the quality of the work completed.  Potential offerors MUST indicate business size in their capability statement and provide the mailing address, phone number, and email address of a point of contact.  All companies who respond to this announcement will receive notification on how NIH intends to proceed with this requirement.  When the solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published.  

This is a market survey, NOT a request for proposals.  

All questions must be directed, in writing, to Andrew Flanzer, Contract Specialist, at flanzera@od.nih.gov.  Capability statements shall be mailed to:

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Facilities Development and Operations (ORF), is seeking sources capable of providing all parts, material, installation tools, test equipment and labor for replacement, repairing, and testing of a 15 KV cable distribution system throughout the NIH main campus in Bethesda, Maryland. 

The 15KV cable system primarily consists of 3 Conductor Paper Insulated, Lead Covered, Jacketed (PILC) and Ethylene Polypropylene Rubber (EPR), 350 and/or 500 MCM cable(s).  Contractor must be able to perform the following three tasks:  

1)  Make emergency repairs involving the repair or replacement and testing of damaged cable, splices, switchgear, circuit breakers, or any other electrical components that are found to be defective.  Please note that emergencies occur 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365/366 days a year.   

2)  Scheduled cable replacement, which shall consist of the replacement of one feeder at a time, in its entirety, from source to final termination in various buildings, the break down and re-connection of splices, testing, and the removal of the old cable.  

3)  Provide technical assistance to NIH employees which may include locating faults, circuit analysis, trouble-shooting, power system analysis, and back-up High-Pot testing of cables.

The vast majority of cable replacement will require the contractor to supply its own cable.  Government furnished cable may be provided in limited situations.  Testing shall be completed per interNational Electrical Testing Association (NETA) Section 7 specifications.

Results of this Sources Sought announcement will be used to determine the best procurement method for this requirement.  Currently NIH intends to issue a solicitation for one base year and four one-year options at a total estimated value exceeding 3 million dollars.

Background Information
The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) provides general executive assistance and direction, policy development, administrative management direction and oversight, operational support and liaison services for the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices (USAOs). As part of this mission, EOUSA provides information technology services to the USAOs. Detailed information regarding the mission and functions of the EOUSA can be found on the Internet at http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/index.html.
The EOUSA Case Management Staff (CMS) is converting the existing case management system from a client/server, Oracle Forms implementation to a web system. CMS is seeking GSA Schedule 70 contractors who are expert at designing web applications using Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) technologies to design and develop the web system.
The Legal Information Office Network System (LIONS) is the current case management system. CMS maintains the LIONS source code. Each USAO uses a separate instance of the database and application to manage the office caseload. Each LIONS instance is operated over the local area network within each USAO.
The Enterprise Case Management System (ECMS) will replace the multiple instances of LIONS with a single, centralized web system. ECMS will operate over the wide area network connecting EOUSA and all USAOs.
Significant requirements analysis and design work has been conducted on the LIONS to ECMS conversion. Some prototyping code for ECMS has been developed.
Note: After receipt and review of the information obtained through this RFI, EOUSA intends to establish a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to complete the ECMS design, system development, and deployment to all 94 USAOs. EOUSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information provided.

<DESC>As part of the FY05 AMH project, the Government requires aircraft hangar doors that open vertically, are insulated and resist infiltration, and are made up of multiple sections, operated either individually or in groups.  The overall hangar opening, with all doors open, will be approximately 225 feet wide by 36 feet tall.  The opening will have up to three (3) separate door sections with swing-up intermediate mullions. Vertical opening doors do not require lateral door pockets and eliminates the rails and/or floor tracks required with sliding doors.  Double-fabric doors with horizontal stiffeners provide structural resistence to wind loading, resistence to infiltration, and provide thermal performance to approximately R-3.  A series of multiple doors with swing-up mullions will provide the user with most flexibility in housing a variety of aircraft sizes and configurations while limiting exposure of the hangar bay to the elements.

<DESC>US ARMY TACOM-Picatinny is conducting Market Research for items or systems that can be used to identify or impede unauthorized personnel who move or disturb  materiel. Of special interest are systems that mark individuals in a manner  undetectable to casual inspection but observable through existent enhanced  vision technology, UV illumination, and other detection gear: but other systems  will be considered. Also of interest are marking systems that leave prompt or  delayed-action visual markings which are difficult to remove from both clothing  and skin. This activity is also interested in area-denial malodorants and  markers that will deter the removal of materiel. Ideally these marking systems  should be effective for 3 days or more, easily man-portable, require no more  than one individual to deploy, require a minute or less to apply, must be non- hazardous MSDS available, and be environmentally safe. A respondent to this  market survey should be able to show that they have the experience or plan,  technical capability, manufacturing capacity, certification to receive export- controlled technical data (as applicable), and good past performance in  production of similar items/systems and system management, as indicators of  existing qualifications. Interested companies who have the necessary  capabilities should respond by providing the following information; a summary  of your company's capabilities to include manufacturer/subcontractors;  description of facilities, personnel, and manufacturing capabilities and  experiences and how they directly relate to the planned procurement; estimated  minimum and maximum monthly production quantities; estimated prices for the  overall item/system (as well as the major items listed above) if applicable;  and the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for production.  A  respondent should state if they have made this item in the past.  If a  respondent does not currently have complete relevant resources (facilities,  equipment, technical, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must identify  their needs and be able to specifically demonstrate his ability to obtain those  resources in a timely fashion.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services  of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must  also meet these criteria.  There is no history for this action and no currently  known commercial-off-the-shelf or modified commercial item/system which meets  the Governmentâ€™s needs. Contractors are requested to provide information as to  the benefits of procuring a solution as a system, rather than using component  breakout.  Information as to the benefits of a systems buy versus another form  of procurement should include cost savings, quality improvements/benefits;  acquisition cycle; terms and conditions and/or any other known benefits.  In  the area of cost savings respondents should indicate if outyear costs will be  reduced after initial startup and facilitization costs have been incurred and  in what year that will occur.  For the area of other benefits respondents  should address potential benefits as risk mitigation or contractor investment.   Any resultant contract will be awarded using Best Value criteria to including  but not limited to: Management/Technical, Past Performance, Price and Small  Business Utilization will be used if a contract is awarded.  Also, provide in  your response your company name, address, point of contact, phone number, e- mail address, company web site (if available) and business size/status (small  or large business).  If your business size is small, please indicate if you are  8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Small Business Concern,  Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern  or a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.  NAICS Code 561621,  SIC Code 7382 and FSC 6350 are applicable to this Sources Sought/Market  Survey.  Responses to this survey shall be submitted within 15 calendar days  from the date of this publication to: jlturner@pica.army.mil.  All information  collected from this market survey shall be used for planning purposes only.   Inadequate information may not support all potential acquisition strategies and  follow-up requests are not planned.  This market survey is for information and  planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP and is not to be  construed as a commitment by the Government. The government does not intend  to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for  information submitted. All information submitted will be held in a confidential  status.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information from U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Strategic Command (SMDC ARSTRAT). The Future Warfare Center (FWC) Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab  West (SMDBL-W) is chartered to build a satellite-type  of ground station for both space and near-space (long loiter) data and communications needs. The Space Battle Lab requests information from industry for this build within 30 calendar days. All questions must be submitted within the first 10 calendar days.  Questions and answers will be published in a timely manner for open review. The Army Space Battle Lab requests the ROM to contain the following detailed information: 1. Major pieces of suggested equipment, 2. A simple overview of an architecture, 3. A sim ple overview of how to proceed, and 4. Any  anticipated issues. Specifics of the requirement are as follows. 1. Satellite communications links: a)Uplink and downlink narrow band to be used for TT&C (Telemetry, Tasking, Communications) and C2 (Command and control) requirements. UHF/SGLS compatible, I nteroperable with the AFSCN (Air Force Space Control Network) standard in S-band with an L-band capability, AFSCN interoperability will allow for over-the-horizon control. Data transmit rates are 19.2Kb/s up to 56Kb/s. b)Wideband sensor data downlink to be  a best possible solution. Data transmit rates are 54 Mb/s minimum, to an unspecified maximum. Ku- and/or X-bands. Possible C-band compatibility. 2. Control system: IP addressable and IPv6 (Internet protocol version 6) compliant, links will pass IP traff ic to/from space and near space platforms and sensors that are IP compliant, IP-compliant data will be disseminated from the ground station to users co-located, in-field, and back through an internet to users located elsewhere. Intent is for ground stati on to be controlled via GUI (Graphical user interface) and accessible via standard web browsers. 3. Antenna solution: a) Will track a variety of craft including rapidly moving aircraft, stationary near-space (~20-300km) platforms, and low earth orbit satel lites. Must be small and mobile (see system notes). Must allow for simultaneous operation of wideband and narrow band links. b) Will be able to control and utilize near-space platforms, utilize LEO (Low Earth orbit) satellites as they pass from horizon to horizon, then reacquire the near-space platform after end of satellite pass.

3.	The code must be a full-wave, 3D, RF field solver capable of generating RF solutions in the electromagnetic near-field, far field and intermediate distances.
4.	The code must be able to generate antenna patterns, calculate RCS, calculate SAR, perform analysis on bulk materials and user defined materials including glossy electric and magnetic materials.
5.	The code must have a PML (perfectly matched layer) method for termination of the simulation region.
6.	Must be able to perform complex math on solved field qualities (e.g. but not limited to vector curl, power density, flux through a given surface, voltage along an arbitrary line path, and currents through a given area of space).  Solutions for full s-parameter analysis of systems must be generated.
7.	The code must run on sun 64 bit OS as well as PC/windows XP.  The license must be centrally located and use FLEXLM licensing software (for NIST system support).
8.	At least two users must be able to solve at one time and another user develop or analyze models.
9.	Functionally identical to HFSS Optimetrics must be included to allow for automatic optimization of models and solution convergence.
10.	The solid modeler (The geometry input, material definition, boundary condition setup, and analysis setup) must allow direct import from AutoCAD/inventor files and IGES files.
11.	The code must be able to fully utilize multiple processors and support multi-threading of solver core.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SBA (Small Business Administration) announces public hearings on size standards
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is holding a series of public hearings throughout the country on small business size standards.  The hearing will also focus on related issues, such as the possible participation of businesses majority-owned by venture capital companies in the Small Business Innovation Research Program.  Testimony presented at these hearings will become part of the administrative record when SBA considers how to simplify and restructure size standards, and make size standards easier to understand and use. <p>


Please read the "Notice of Public Hearings" at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#hearings.  The notice provides the location, date and format of the 11 hearings.  All individuals who wish to address SBA at a hearing and all who wish to attend must register in advance.  The notice provides guidance on how to register. <p>
 

On March 19, 2004, SBA had published a proposed rule to simplify and restructure its small business size standards by establishing most size standards based on the number of employees of a business concern.  SBA also proposed to reduce the number of different size standard levels significantly (69 FR 13130).  Those who commented on the proposed rule also focused on other questions on which SBA had not requested comments in the proposed rule.  SBA therefore withdrew it on July 1, 2004.  Because SBA considered the additional issues important, SBA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on December 3, 2004, seeking comments specifically on these supplementary issues.   <p>


SBA requests that testimony focus on the issues discussed in the ANPRM, the general issue of simplifying size standards, other improvements to size standards, or any of the other issues identified in the notice.

<RESPDATE>060105

<DESC>The FHWA, Office of Federal Lands Highways (FLH) is making a comprehensive revision and electronic publication of its Project Development and Design Manual (PDDM).  The PDDM currently provides technical and policy guidance for the interdisciplinary project development and design-related activities performed by the three field Divisions of the FLH and its consultants.  The PDDM last underwent a comprehensive revision in 1996 when it was intended primarily as an in-house reference.  The PDDM currently exists in MS Word format and on the web in Adobe PDF format at http://www.wfl.fha.dot.gov/design/manual/.  The existing document is approximately 730 pages including exhibits, tables and appendices.  This Scope of Work (SOW) concerns only Chapter 6 of the PDDM (Geotechnical) which is approximately 90 pages in its current form.  

The intent is to create a high-level gateway electronic document that provides policy, standards, and criteria, and links (either electronically or by citation of publications) to other documents that provide technical /how to/ guidance and information on FLH organizational processes.  This SOW is for assistance in preparing the materials for the FLH Policy, Standards/Guidance, and Criteria and supporting Commentary.  The existing Chapter 6 of the PDDM will be replaced or substantially revised and the new chapter will serve as a gateway to all information needed to perform geotechnical services for FLH by in-house staff and external A/E consultants.  Where possible, the new Chapter 6 will link to other sources of information rather than reproduce the information.

This work involves converting Chapter 6 of the PDDM from a combination policy/procedure /how-to/ hard-copy manual to primarily a policy-only, web-based document with electronic links to referenced documents containing the theoretical background as well as application details for the recommended procedures and methodologies needed to execute a particular investigation and/or analysis.  The new chapter will be more of a /what/ document and may be considerably shorter than the existing one.  It will contain language similar to a performance-based specification rather than a method specification.  The new format will be a cross between a conventional manual and a web-based user interface to put the user in touch, in a prioritized and structured way, with hundreds of pages of previously published reference and guidance material.

For the complete SOW that includes deliverables, period of performance, evaluation factors for award, and pricing pages, please visit our web at http://www.cflhd.gov/   Click on the Procurement tab, Current Solicitations, Solicitations-Other.  The web sites provided in this announcement must be entered manually-a direct link from this announcement is not operative.

This is a combined solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information and instructions included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and is a Request for Proposal; Standard Form 1449 will not be used to issue the solicitation. 

This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns and will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract, not to exceed $80,000.  The NAICS code is 511199; small business size standard is 500 employees. 

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03, Effective 11 Apr 2005.  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or or Executive Orders-Commercial Items including subparagraphs (b) (5), (14), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (26), and (31).  See FAR 52.212-3 (Mar 2005) to complete Representations and Certifications.

This solicitation also includes FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  The technical evaluation factors are stated on page 10 of the Statement of Work.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.
