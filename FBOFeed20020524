<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a  Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a Liquid Propellant Based Combustion Wave Ignition System. The proposed research/test program seeks to identify and demonstrate techniques for conditioning liquid hydrocarbon fuels, JP-7 or RP-1, such that they will sustain a robust detonation, thereby enabling operation of the ignition system with the same propellants used in a multiple thrust chamber system; the liquid oxidizer, LOX, will also need to be gasified prior to ignition.  Once this capability has been successfully demonstrated in a laboratory environment, CWI hardware will be designed and built in order to demonstrate repeatable ignition in an actual liquid oxidizer/liquid hydrocarbon (LHC) fueled rocket thrust chamber. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from General Applied Science Laboratories (GASL) pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 for other than full and open competition for acquistion of services from only one source. GASL has direct experience in all areas supporting the proposed work, including cataytic decomposition of liquid hydrocarbon fuel, combusion wave igniation systems design, and chemical kinetic evaluation of detonations via analytical and experimental process. Quotations should be submitted on or before June 11, 2002 by COB. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Notes 22 and 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Space Based Laser Project Office is inviting research responses to conduct Experiment Definition Studies (EDS) which should be focused on the development and definition of near term and affordable experiments that demonstrate significant milestones on a path to providing increased capability to joint warfighters with the use of lasers through space.  Prospective offerors should consider innovative approaches for experimentally demonstrating advances in state of the art technology in technically and programmatically logical and affordable steps toward eventual operational capabilities in the near term (~FY08-10), with increasing capabilities leading to a far term (post FY20) system. See the Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) attached to this synopsis for a detailed description of the technical requirements and proposal instructions.  The total program budget for the first phase of these efforts is approximately $350K and $1.0M for the second phase.  For the first phase, each proposal may not exceed $100K for an initial two-month period of performance.  The overarching goal is to sufficiently define technically sound and executable experiments in sufficient detail the offeror can make meaningful estimates for cost/budget, schedule, milestones, support requirements and traceability to an operational capability.  These experiment definition studies will form the basis of planning and budgeting for near term technology experiments.  They will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase is a two-month study exploring the broad range of potential concepts, and concluding with a final presentation (report and briefing) at the end of the period of performance.  The successful offeror(s) will recommend concepts, for more detailed Phase II study efforts, that will satisfy the objectives and achieve the overarching goals stated above.  The Government will use a PRDA to solicit Phase II study efforts.  These efforts will be based on government-selected concepts that were recommended at the completion of Phase I.  The Phase II period of performance is planned for Oct 02 through Feb 03 (subject to the availability of FY03 program funds).  Proposals are due not later than 25 June 2002, 2:00 pm (Pacific Daylight Time).  Proposals shall be submitted to SMC/TLK, Attn:  Paula Bryant, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467-80, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The South American Institute for Medical Research (SAIMR), Ministry of Health, a contract to conduct population based active surveillance for cryptococcosis in Gauteng province, South Africa.  These services will include, but is not limited to the following (1) collect isolates, complete cryptococcal surveillance initiative case report, and maintain database; (2) deliver isolates collected to CDC Laboratory; (3) submit database and cryptococcosis trend reports on a quarterly basis.  The South American Institute for Medical Research (NHL, National Health Laboratory System) is the only known institution in Gauteng province (Johannesburg) that can provide the necessary infrastructure to perform this project.  This project requires that cryptococcal isolates be collected on a regular basis from all laboratories in the province.  All public health laboratories in the province operate under the auspices of the National Health Laboratory (NHL), so the participation of the NHL is critical to ensuring that isolates from the public hospitals can be collected.  The NHL Central Laboratory, which is the reference laboratory for the province, possesses the staff and expertise so that isolates can be collected and maintained appropriately.  Furthermore, the project also requires that demographic and clinical information be collected from medical records of patients with cryptococcosis.  SAIMR faculty participate in teaching and providing clinical service in many hospitals in Gauteng province and have collaborated with many investigators in these hospitals on other projects, which will ensure a more complete date collection for surveillance purposes. The period of performance is twenty-four months.  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded around August 31, 2002 with performance to begin September 1, 2002.  The scheduled solicitation issue date is approximately June 12, 2002.  The solicitation will also be posted at this website (http://www.eps.gov/) on or around June 12, 2002.  Any amendments issued to this solicitation will also be available at the same website.  Hardcopies of the solicitation and any amendments issued will not be mailed to the offerors.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Covance Research Products, PO Box 7200, Denver, PA  17517.  Covance Research Products provide the FDA services for the production of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies against heat stable antigens provided by the FDA.  These antiseras and monoclonal antibodies will be used to test feed and feed ingredients for the presence or absence of prohibited materials.  The results of these analyses will be used for research purposes and may also be used to aid FDA's enforcement of the feed ban. Within the first 90 days, the contractor will have initiated production of both polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibody production. Concerning polyclonal antisera production, within the first 60 days, two goats will have been immunized with a combination of Freund's Complete Adjuvant and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant a total of three times, with a minimum of one ELISA screening assay being conducted after the last of these four immunizations. Within the first 180 days, animals producing acceptable antisera will have been moved into a production schedule designed to yield larger amounts of antisera. Ideally, this process would use a procedure such as plasmapheresis, which is capable of yielding 800-1000 ml of plasma, as opposed to the typical yield of 200 ml of sera typically obtained when obtaining large volumes of blood from goats. This schedule of production will be maintained through the end of the contract.  Within the first 90 days, the contractor will have immunized a minimum of 5 mice for production of monoclonal antibodies. The contractor will have also tested the plasma from these same mice so the scientists at CVM can select the most appropriate animal. Within the next 90 days, contractor will have used this animal to produce hybridomas. The contractor will also conduct an initial ELISA screen of all wells showing positive growth as well as a second round of ELISA screening following the subcloning process. Additional work may include, but is not limited to, cryopreservation of cells from all positive primary wells, cloning of all selected positive wells with ELISA testing, expansion and/or cryopreservation of primary clones as well as subclones. Once suitable hybridomas have been identified, contractor will begin in vitro production of the monoclonal antibody(ies) using either CL 1000 or hollow fiber bioreactor technologies.  The FDA anticipates a one (1) year period of performance.  An award will be made fifteen (15) days from date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes, however, sources may submit descriptive literature which full demonstrate their product meets the specification which shall be considered by the agency.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance which FAR Subpart 13.5

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) seeks to acquire mass spectral data in areas of need in the NIST Mass Spectral database.  Specifically, spectral data for O-silyl, N-acyl, and methyl derivatives of mono- and poly- functional compounds are sought.  These spectra need to be measured using a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and must be reference quality mass spectra.  The mass spectra shall be sent to NIST in electronic form.  The Chemical Abstracts Service registry number shall be included if available, as well as the chemical name, the chemical structure, and the measured retention index.  The contractor shall measure a minimum of 1200 up to a maximum of 3000 mass spectra per year.  The contract shall consist of a base period of one year starting with the date of the award and 4 option periods of one year each.  The total number of spectra to be measured for the base and option periods shall not exceed 15000.  NIST requires delivery of a minimum of 100 measured spectra per calendar month.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) is receiving a steady influx of new spectra that need to be evaluated before being added to the NIST Mass Spectral Database. This evaluation needs to be done in a timely and efficient manner.  The contractor shall evaluate the quality of reported mass spectra by using the structure of the compound and known good spectra of similar compounds.  The evaluation shall involve determining that the mass spectrum of a compound with a given structure is reasonable by using probable losses from the molecular ion, and well-established rearrangements of ions with corresponding neutral losses from the structure of the presumed starting compound.  The evaluation shall require the ability to assess the possibility of contamination either by air, water, isomers, or other species that may co elute in gas-chromatography columns.  In addition, the evaluation will require the ability to evaluate the probability of thermal decomposition of the molecule in the ion-source of the mass spectrometer and an understanding of the ions resulting from species that have no stable ions. NIST will provide to the contractor copies of the spectra to be evaluated along with the names and chemical structures of the presumed starting compounds.  These will be provided either as paper copies of the spectra or in electronic format.  In order to read the electronic files a copy of the NIST Mass Spectra Search Program will be made available to the contractor. The contractor shall have experience in examining both good and bad spectra.  The minimum requirements for this work include, but are not limited to, a degree in chemistry and at least two years of experience analyzing and evaluating mass spectra data.  Experience with routine mass spectra analysis is not sufficient for this purpose.  Published papers showing research in correlating spectra to structure or documented prior experience with such correlations must be provided.  NIST will deliver a minimum of 15000 up to a maximum of 25000 mass spectra per year with the associated structures that should be analyzed.  The contract shall consist of a base period of one year starting with the date of the award and 4 option periods of one year each.  The total number of spectra to be analyzed for the base and option periods shall not exceed 125000.  NIST will deliver a minimum of 1250 spectra per month for evaluation.  NIST requires delivery of the analysis no later than 45 calendar days following the receipt of the spectra and structures from NIST - FOB Destination. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) proposes to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis a program entitled, “ AH-64 D Integrated Engine Diagnostic System”.  The objective of this program is to integrate existing diagnostic s ystems of the T700 engine into the AH-64D aircraft.  Currently there are ongoing programs and logistic systems that are being integrated into an on-board system that will provide real-time diagnostics data for the Army maintenance officer.  One such progra m is called the Aviation Turbine Engine Diagnostics System (ATEDS).  ATEDS is currently being used on the Joint Advanced Health and Usage Monitoring System (JAHUMS) on a UH-60 T700 engine.  Since the AH-64D also uses a version of the T700 engine, this prog ram will leverage off work done on JAHUMS.  The AH-64D currently incorporates the Longbow Integrated Maintenance Support System (LIMSS), which is a digitized maintenance recording system.  The LIMSS will be integrated with ATEDS and with engine non-volatil e memory (NVM) data from the T700 digital electronic control unit (DECU).  The goal of this effort is to integrate the previous mentioned programs into an on-board engine maintenance system on the AH-64D and to demonstrate the system’s operation with field  tests.   It is anticipated that this will be a 36-month technical effort.  A noncompetitive acquisition to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, (MDHC) Mesa, Arizona is intended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  MDHC is deemed to be the only responsibl e source because they are the developer and sole supplier of the AH-64D and LIMSS ground analysis software (GAS).  MDHC is the only firm that possesses the necessary technical data required to perform this integration effort.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposal; however, all responses received from interested sources will be reviewed by the Government and given due consideration as required by law.  Specification, plans or drawings relating to this procurement are not available and cannot  be furnished by the Government.  The Government anticipates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract, which will be developed jointly between the Government and MDHC, consistent with Alpha Contracting procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses , and provisions in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  No Options are included in this acquisition.  Accordingly, a formal solicitation for this program will not be issued.  Written responses or comments should be addressed to AATD,  ATTN: AMSAM-RD-AA-C, (Delores Thompson, Contract Specialist) Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  (Delores Thompson may be reached at 757-878-4825 – FAX: 757-878-0008 – Email: dthomas@aatd.eustis.army.mil)  The Contracting Officer is John H. Barbie (757-878-5003) FBO Numbered Notes: 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Mr. Daniel F. McMullan (717) 605-5659 Technical: Mr. Bradley S. Sanders JEDMICS Sustainment, Eng Data Management, and PRIDE PM, IDE Program Office MSG/MMF E-mail: bradley.sanders@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point—Mechanicsburg, PA, is seeking information pertinent to meeting the needs of the U.S. Air Force Engineering Data Management community regarding the management of engineering drawings and related technical data. The purpose of this request for information is to determine rough order of magnitude cost, commerciality and schedule estimates to implement or, if necessary, develop a next-generation common engineering data management system. Presently, the three Air Logistics centers, WR-ALC, OC-ALC, and OO-ALC, receive, process, store, disseminate and share engineering data to support Air Force weapons systems.  The Joint Engineering Data Management Information Control System (JEDMICS) system is the principle repository interfacing with numerous other information technology systems.  The Air Force is seeking a commercial next-generation data managem ent system, process, or tool that maintains current functionality but is sufficiently flexible to satisfy additional requirements such as:      Web/GUI COE Level 5 Cert and Accreditation C4ISP/CON/CTO GCSS-AF Integration Data Architecture Encryption Migrate to Open Platform Migrate to Oracle 9i XML Implement PKI Migrate to Same Level OS AF Portal Enabled Software Instrumentation Migrate to PC-COE Single Help Desk Any recommendation must be a standalone solution that assimilates the functionality of existing data systems.  Interoperability between the common solution and JEDMICS must be maintained to ensure interoperability with other Services and DLA who will still be using JEDMICS.  Interoperability with MEDALS must also be maintained. The solution may have to interface with other Government data systems that hold data that the Air Force engineering data c ommunity needs but does not own. A contractor operated service option may be considered if it meets cost and security constraints. The requirements that are being satisfied by the current systems—JEDMICS, Integrated Data Information Management System IDIM, or Centra 2000—must be satisfied immediately in any solution. These core requirements must be accomplished within 24 months. The remaining unsatisfied requirements must be satisfied as soon as possible in three phases: Phase 1-within the first 24 months and Phase 2 – within 25 - 48 months, Phase 3 – greater than 48 months.  Interested parties MUST register as a ‘Supplier’ in the NAVICP eProcurement tool at <http://govauctions.procuri.com>. Each registered supplier will be required to send notification of successful registration via email to Mr. Daniel F. McMullan at <daniel_f_mcmullan@icpmech.navy.mil>. Suppliers regis tered before this notice will be required to send notification of such registration via email to Mr. Daniel F. McMullan. Upon availability of the prospective solicitation or pertinent documents, each registered supplier will be notified via email of the invitation to participate in this acquisition. Upon invitation to participate in this acquisition each registered supplier can gain access to the solicitation or pertinent documents at <http://govauctions.procuri.com>.  All communication pursuant to this RFI must be accomplished through E-Mail and the NAVICP eProcurement tool.

<SOLNBR>NCI-20050-NG
<RESPDATE>061002
<ARCHDATE>06252002
<CONTACT>Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov - Caren Rasmussen, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email rasmusc@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Basic Research Laboratory, (BRL) Gene Response Section (GRS), plans to  procure a Low Dose Irradiator from JL Shepherd and Associates, 1010 Arroyo Avenue, San Fernando, California 91340-1822.   The Basic Model 89 Low Dose Irradiator is a custom device manufactured by JL Shepherd and Associates.  The laboratory currently owns an irradiator, purchased from JL Shepherd that is used for delivering higher doses of X-ray radiation.  The laboratory would like to complement that irradiator with a  new low dose irradiator.  The low dose irradiator will allow the lab to perform complementary experiments with X-ray radiation at lower doses.  The irradiator will be used to perform experiments in cells and mice using lower doses of irradiation.  These experiments will help determine the effects of low dose gamma irradiation on cancer cells.  The following minimum specifications are required for the low dose irradiator: 1)  access tudes through which utility lines can be run into the irradiation chamber.  This feature is important because the lab needs to be able to place a heating element inside the chamber to maintain a 37 degree Celsius environment for cells that are irradiating for hours so that they do not die during an experiment, 2) has very large turntables (12" by 14") that will allow the lab to irradiate a large number of samples at one time, 3) capable of delivering a flexible dose range.  The laboratory requires dose from 0.1R/minute to 30R/minute.  Attenuators that are available for purchase with this irradiator will allow the lab to achieve doses as low as 0.01R/minute and, 4) space constraints also need to be addressed.  The JL Shepherd irradiator is believed to be the smallest available, roughly the size of a home refrigerator (at the widest point the base is 34" wide x  44" deep and the height of the unit is 65").  The instrument must be able to fit in the designated room where the laboratory currently houses the other JL Shepherd irradiator.   The JL Shepherd and Associates Low Dose Irradiator is the only low dose irradiator known to the NCI that can meet the above minimum requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be n writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 10, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  If interested, please submit one (1) original and two (2) copies to the following: Attn. Malinda Holdcraft Purchasing Agent, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland, 20852.

Description:  Stones shall be roughly angular in shape, having their least dimensions not less than one-third of the greater dimension. Rectangular block stone, slabs, and rounded boulders will not be accepted.  The stone shall weigh not less than 155 pounds per cubic foot, dry, in air.  Gradation:  Rock I: Stone shall have the following gradation: 100% Lighter 650-280 lbs.(stone weight); 50% Lighter 220-130 lbs (stone weight).; 15% Lighter 130-40 lbs (stone weight).  Rock II: Stone shall have the following gradation: 100% Lighter	90-40 lbs.; 50% Lighter	40-20 lbs.; 15% Lighter	20-5 lbs.  Core Stone: Stone shall have the following gradation : 100% Passing 4 U.S. Std. Sieve (in.); 70-90% Passing 3 U.S. Std. Sieve (in.); 15-50% Passing 1 1/2 U.S. Std. Sieve (in.); 0-20% Passing 1/2 U.S. Std. Sieve (in.); 0-21% Passing.  Measurement:  Stone will be measured in short tons of 2,000 pounds.  Contra ctor shall furnish the Government a displacement table for each barge(s), showing the load in tons of 2,000 pounds.  The barge(s) will be gauged before unloading and again after unloading at destination.  In determining the tonnage, the change in gauge rea ding due to the load will be used.  Barge(s) will be pumped dry before both gaugings.  Gauges will be read by a Government Inspector, and the Contractor is invited to be present when the readings are taken.  Delivery: The “Core Stone” shall be delivered fi rst followed by “Rock I” then “Rock II”.  The stone shall be delivered via contractor’s flush deck barge(s) to Belle River Landing, approximate Mile 19.7 on the Morgan City-Port Allen Alternate Route, LA.  Barge(s) must have mooring bits at all corners and  on both sides at the middle of the barge.

POC is Mr. Donald Constantine , (504) 862-2253.  Delivery Terms: The Government will unload the material at a rate of approximately 800 tons per workday.  A workday will be 10 hours each day, Monday through Friday, exclusive of holidays.  The empty barge(s) will be released to the cont ractor at the delivery site.  Demurrage Charges: Three (3) workdays free time shall be allowed for unloading each barge.  It is expected that the unloading rate specified above will be adequate to unload each barge during the free time period; however, in the event more time is required, demurrage charges will be paid at the rate quoted by the contractor.  The estimated numbers of day’s demurrage are for evaluation purposes only and payment will be made at the Contractor’s unit price for only those days act ually used.

<DESC>This is Amendment 1 to solicitation 9-BH13-26-02-54P . This amendment requests additional proposal information and addresses questions received, regarding the combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Benefits of Space Exhibit Trailer posted on May 14, 2002.  The basic contract period of performance is changed and will be June 28, 2002 in Cresco, Iowa with the first event date being July 1, 2002.  In addition, the following website provides more information concerning the Benefits of Space program and the schedule for the next 3 months.  The website is as follows:  http://technology.jsc.nasa.gov/   The contractor shall supply a separate line item on the SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items to propose the the travel costs associated with the training the contractor is required to attend prior to the award of this contract.  The training will be conducted in Cresco, Iowa from June 28 through June 29, 2002. The following questions were received.  The questions and answers are below. Question 1 Provide a picture of the Benefits of Space Exhibit Trailer Answer: A picture of the Benefits of Space Exhibit Trailer is included with this Amendment. Question 2 You state that evaluation is based on 40% relevant past performance.  Does that mean a track record with NASA Benefits of Space or a track record with similar business? Answer: The 40% relevant past performance pertains to experience with similar types of exhibits.  Question 3 Value Characteristics are performanced based and permit selection of the offer which provides better results for a marginal increase in price.  Could you please elaborate on this statement? Answer: If the Government receives an offer that is of a higher price and that offer gives the Government a better value than an offer of a lower price, then the Government has the right to select the offer with the better value. Question 4 Is the trailer in Houston? Answer: The Benefits Of Space trailer is currently on tour.  The period of performance for this contract will begin on June 28, 2002 to train the awardee at the event in Cresco, Iowa.  The awardee will then drive the trailer to the next event in Omaha, Nebraska.  The Benefits Of Space Exhibit is scheduled to be in Omaha, Nebraska on July 1, 2002.   Question 5 During the down time in November and December you have requested that our driver make 2 trips to assist in the upgrades.  How long would that person need to be there? Answer: The contractor should plan on being in Houston 1 to 2 days for each trip. Question 6 "The price of all delivery orders will be a single uniform average price reflected in the basic contract on a per event basis.  The following information is necessary for the contractor to calculate a per event price."  Can you give me clarification or is this simply asking us to break down our total based on 6 events per month for 41/2 months? Answer: The price needs to be all-inclusive per event.  There is an average of 6 events per month with a down period in November and December.  The basic contract is for 6 months, with four option periods.  Please propose a fixed price value on a per event basis for the basic contract as well as the option periods.  While November and December are scheduled to be downtimes for the exhibit for maintenance, there is still a possibility of events taking place during this period. Question 7 When the trailer is at JSC during November and December, other than the 2 trips is our driver off until it goes out again or does he stay on call? Answer: The contractor should have the capability to be available to support any unforeseen events.  There will be a minimum of 3 days notification but typically any support will be scheduled two weeks in advance. Question 8 Drivers typically act as driver, installation and can help with the public when available.  The Statement Of Work states that the contractors shall serve as a tour guide for the exhibit during display times, except when performing maintenance or performing operating systems repair.  Our driver can do all these things.  However, he is restricted by law to 10 hours per day, which includes during and all duties.  Is this statement telling me that I need a second person to assist the driver?  Or is that for us to decide? Answer: Your proposal should include information asked for in the solicitation and Statement of Work.  How you decide to man the exhibit is your decision.  The driver/exhibit operator should plan on a maximum of nine event hours per day, plus pre and post event time for exhibit setup and disassembly. Question 9 Do I need to review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) references that were part of the solicitation?   Answer: In order to respond to the solicitation completely, all FAR and FAC references should be reviewed by the prospective bidders. Question 10 Are we to supply you a 6 month budget, or a 6, 12, 12, 18 budgets? Answer: See answer to question No. 6. Question 11 The permit SSR is used for selling goods across state lines.  Will we be selling anything? Answer: You will not be selling anything. Question 12 Shall the documentation for the requirements to identify key personnel, provide photographs of the tractor, provide proof of experience, provide references, provide transition plan, and to provide the preventative maintenance plan be attached to the offer forms? Answer: All information requested in the solicitation should be included in your proposal along with the offer forms. Question 13 Will training and orientation in the operation of the exhibit, and acting as tour guide be provided by NASA for the driver/exhibit operator?  If so, where will it occur. Answer: See answer to Question number 4. Question 14 Will the driver/exhibit operator be allowed to reside in the tractor at all exhibit events?  If not, for purposes of calculating alternate lodging expense in the offer, at approximately how many events will this not be allowed? Answer: The driver/exhibit operator will not be permitted to reside in the tractor while on-site at an exhibit venue.  Residence in the tractor, while in transit from exhibit site to exhibit site, between events is at the exhibit operator's/driver's discretion. Question 15 Approximately how many hours per day will the driver/exhibit operator be on duty at an event? Answer: Please see answer to question number 8. Question 16 Our tractor is currently operating under a common arrangement in which operating authority, liability insurance, IFTA registration, etc. are provided by another party.  Since considerable expense will be incurred to furnish these items, is it acceptable for them to be provided after the contract award? Answer: Copies of all required paperwork are to be furnished with the proposal as this will form part of the basis for selection. Question 17 The initial 6 month contract begins July 1, 2002.  When will time be scheduled for training?  When is the new contractor to assume operation? Answer: Please see answer to question 4. Question 18 The contractor shall provide a detailed written transition plan that identifies seamless assumption of trailer operations.  The transition plan will address all contract requirements.  We are cognizant of how event logistics can be transitioned, but our company needs more technical details regarding the on-site operations in order to prepare a detailed transition plan for technical operations. Answer: The contractor should provide a plan with as much detail as possible with the proposal.  Each event site is different.  The contractor needs to be flexible and submit a generic plan that can be used in different situations.  Once the contract is awarded and the driver/exhibit operator has received training, the contractor may then revise their plan. Question 19 The contractor shall be responsible for the delivery of the trailer to and from authorized maintenance and repair firms as needed.  In the case of trailer breakdown, such as broken axel on the highway, is the contractor responsible for making arrangements but not payment of the costs for towing the trailer to a repair facility? Answer: The Government is ultimately responsible for payment, however the contractor may have to pay for the repair and be reimbursed by the Government. Question 20 Paragraph 3.2 of the Statement of Work references the downtime and the two trips to JSC.  Since this must be rolled into overall pricing we need to know the approximate length of time at JSC for each trip. Answer: Each trip should be priced for 2 days.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is a follow-up to a notice posted May 2, 2002 identifying the Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) intent to acquire an integrated, automated information system, which will be known as the United States Entry Exit system.  As previously communicated, DOJ (INS) plans to competitively procure, through full and open competition, the services and supplies required to design, develop, deploy, and support an integrated, automated information system (hereafter referred to as the United States Entry Exit System) to record the arrivals and departures of visitors to/from the United States.  In addition, the INS still intends to issue a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early June 2002 and a final RFP in late June / early July 2002 timeframe.
The acquisition/procurement strategy for the United States Entry Exit System will encompass three phases: Pre-System Acquisition; System Acquisition; and Production, Deployment, and Sustainment.  In general, the Pre-System Acquisition Phase will occur between June/July 2002 and September/October 2002, and focus on (1) evaluating industry's (i.e., individual vendor/team) technical capability (to include a high-level conceptual design), past performance, and preliminary technical approach/price for designing/developing the United States Entry Exit System based upon a Government-generated Statement of Objectives (SOO) and supporting documentation, and (2) reducing (via a down-selection process) the number of vendors who will then actually develop a preliminary system design and prototype in the System Acquisition Phase.  It is the intent of INS to have at least two competitors enter the System Acquisition Phase. The System Acquisition Phase will occur between September/October 2002 and January/February 2003, and focus on (1) evaluating both preliminary system designs/prototypes and technical/cost proposals for full-scale development, deployment, and initial sustainment based upon a refined SOO and additional supporting documentation (namely, a System "Blueprint" [i.e., "As-Is" and emerging "To-Be" architecture, business processes, and legacy systems] and Functional Requirements Document), and (2) reducing (via a down-selection process) the number of vendors who will then actually conduct full-scale development, deployment, and initial sustainment in the Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase.  It is the intent of INS to have one vendor (team) enter the Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase.
The Production, Deployment, and Initial Sustainment Phase will occur between January/February 2003 and December 2005, and focus on fulfilling a myriad of legislative/operational requirements.  The former include the Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 [US Code Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part IX, Sec. 1365a. Formal name - Integrated entry and exit data system], Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act of 2000 [US Code Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, Sec. 1187. Formal name - Visa Waiver program for certain visitors], USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 [Public Law No: 107-56, H.R. 3162.  Formal name - Uniting and strengthening America by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism], and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 [Public Law 107-173, H.R. 3525].  These documents are not available through the INS, Procurement Office.  Lastly, the INS strongly encourages industry-teaming arrangements and, via the RFP, will mandate subcontracting/small business requirements.

 Description:    Statement of  Work
Research Services for Comparing the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey to the Current Population Survey

	Supporting Statement
Introduction

The Census Bureau conducted the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) during 2000 and 2001 in nationwide tests of the American Community Survey (ACS) questionnaire.  For both years, the sample size was 700,000 households.  The tests were designed to demonstrate the viability of using data collected over several years as a replacement for the Census long form.  The C2SS included questions about work and search for work so that some rough measure of labor force would be available along with the other social and economic data collected in the survey.  

BLS staff has conducted preliminary reviews of the 2000 C2SS data.  (Data for the 2001 C2SS will be available during the summer of 2002.)  These data differ from the official measures of employment and unemployment for the nation obtained from the Current Population Survey and from the official State labor force data developed from the LAUS program.  The C2SS data report a population and civilian labor force that are lower than the CPS annual average for 2000.  Employment and the employment-to-population ratios from the C2SS are lower than those obtained from the CPS and unemployment levels and rates are higher.  The difference in the population data is counter to expectations, especially because the C2SS uses 2000 Census population controls as enumerated.  However, the universe for the C2SS does not include group quarters, which are included in the CPS.

A number of factors may account for the differences in the estimates.  For example, the C2SS has less detailed questions about employment and unemployment than the CPS.   In addition, the CPS collects data for a fixed reference period, the week that includes the 12th of the month, while the reference period for the C2SS depends on when the respondent fills out the survey.  Other reasons for differences in the estimates include the population controls and universe used by the surveys and different modes of collections ? interviewers for the CPS versus primarily mail response for the C2SS.  


Objectives
The aim of this project is to understand the nature of the differences in labor force estimates between the C2SS and the CPS.


Description of the Project

1.	Review what is currently known and available.  This includes a careful review of existing documentation and interviewing BLS and Census research staff.
2.	Examine the year 2000 tabulations of the C2SS and compare findings with the CPS.  Extend current analysis by making comparisons by age and ethnicity, retaining State detail.  Explore differences attributed to collection mode, reference date, and nonresponse adjustment.
3.	Identify and compare the consistency of patterns observed in the C2SS data for 2001 with 2000.  It is possible that the differences observed in 2000 will be smaller in 2001. 

Description and Scope of Work

The contractor shall develop and test a methodology for comparing the C2SS (both 2000 and 2001 estimates) with those for the CPS.  Further, the contractor will make recommendations on the potential use of the C2SS data in the LAUS methodology, either directly or indirectly. 

The research shall be carried out over a 9-month period, July 1, 2002?March 31, 2003.   Regular contact with BLS staff is planned.  Contact with Bureau of the Census staff may also be required.  A draft report concerning the research shall be submitted by September 30, 2002.  Two presentations at BLS conferences may be performed with travel expenses the responsibility of BLS.   The draft  report in October 22-24, 2002, in San Antonio, Texas.   The final  report will be submitted by January 31, 2003.   Throughout the period, regular communications (at least twice a month) with BLS will take place in the form of e-mail and other exchanges.

Inspection and Acceptance

BLS will make the final inspection and acceptance of all items called for in the project.

Deliverables

The provider shall submit the following items to BLS.  The delivery dates are measured from the commencement of the project, July 1, 2002.  

Item		Description					Delivery Date
1.  		Letter of understanding on work 		2 weeks upon award of PO
				
2.  		Draft project report				September 30, 2002

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This notice is issued as part of PMS NSW’s preliminary market research efforts.  PMS NSW intends to evaluate the responses received to establish which system improvement solutions are currently available and appear to have the highest potential for improvingsuccess in addressing SDV operational and logistical capabilities.  PMS NSW intends to use the information, with other information considered as well, to conduct further market research and product analysis. It is anticipated that a solicitation for services and products will be issued as a result of this market  research to begin implementation of COTS equipment and designs into the MK 8 MOD 1 SDV (SLEP). PMS NSW reserves the right to hold (additional/new) market research meetings, including system demonstrations, if necessary, with some, but not necessarily all firms responding to this notice.  The preferred approach at this time is to leverage COTS systems to the maximum extent possible, PMS NSW is also open to alternative solutions and minimal development items with value added potential. BACKGROUND:  The MK 8 MOD 1 SDV (SLEP) is a manned submersible vehicle produced in small quantities and used to deliver Navy SEALs and their equipment to mission areas.  The crew operates and navigates the submerged SDV while using underwater breathing apparatus (UBA) for life support.  The vehicle is battery-powered and equipped with propulsion, navigation, communication and life support eq uipment.  The MK 8 MOD 1 SDV is capable of delivering several fully equipped SEALs to a mission area, loitering in the area, retrieving the SEALs and exfiltrating from the area while remaining completely submerged.  SCOPE:  Additions, upgrades and improvement areas pertaining to near-term SDV modernization efforts include but are not limited to the following areas:  Communications systems improvements, energy absorption alternatives, alternative training methodology and computer-platform interface training simulators, two and three dimensional navigation displays for improved underwater situational awareness, open architecture designs, common non-proprietary systems, alternative bus controller systems that meet or exceed MIL-SPEC requirements with high reliability, built-in redundancy and increased data transmission rates, ergonomic control, multi-axis integrated auto-pilot  system, control display systems, alternative material construction, underwater navigation improvement systems, information management interpretation and display system, design integration, system integration analysis, alternative material platform construction, high capacity alternative power sources, alternative underwater propulsion methods, mission package development, built in automated system failure identification, system self diagnostics, alternative mobility platforms for rapid insertion and extraction of assets. Logistical areas of interest include: process improvement strategies, document management systems that allow for improved sharing of information with applicable safeguards, user-friendly features, efficient update and control of drawings and system designs, efficient parts tracking methods and parts identification, commonality of parts and repair tools, simpli fied technical and repair manuals, simplified customer feedback process, training methodology changes, training requirements identification.    RESPONSES:  Responses should discuss capabilities, benefits, concepts for new systems, upgrades to known fielded systems, integration concerns, developmental issues and most recent demonstrations, potential mission or capability relevance, system reliability, Mean Time Between Failures, supply and support requirements, anticipated future support, implementation timeline, and cost estimate.  Discuss your system’s degree of ruggedability, extent of waterproofing if any, potential for packaging.    List customers who have completed implementation of your system, results of field tests and parameters of such tests, compatibility with other systems and software.  Briefly discuss your vision and future plans for your offered system, inc luding your direction for emerging technology. Include why PMS NSW should be interested in your system and why you should be included in its future solicitation list.  Discuss your firm’s direct and relevant experience in providing, installing and maintaining these commercial or developmental systems.  Identify if your firm has preferred implementation of COTS systems.  Provide references and customer points of contact for your COTS system (both public and private) where currently operational.   In addition, provide whether your system is offered on the General Services Administration’s Federal Supply Schedule.  Provide a complete copy of the contract, identify which line items make up your system, and corresponding price list.   If applicable, state whether your system will operate with known commercial software systems (1) without modification, (2) with minor modificati on or (3) not as currently offered.  If your system is not based on commercial software systems or compliant with Joint Technical Architecture, it may still be considered a viable system.  However, it will be subject to additional scrutiny and, at a later time, a separate cost benefit analysis on a total cost basis in terms of development, maintenance, support and interoperability.   If available provide copies of any evaluations of your system conducted by outside, independent organizations.   Responses in the form of white papers are requested in order to minimize the labor and cost associated with the production of detailed proposals.

<RESPDATE>060702
<ARCHDATE>07072002
<CONTACT>Michael Doelling, 732-532-3973
<DESC>NA This is an update to the effort previously advertised on April 11, 2000 in the Commerce Business Daily, printed issue date April 13, 2000 under solicitation DAAB07-00-R-E503.  This effort is proposed as a modification to existing contract DAAB07-01-D-E502,  sole source to TRW as the Total Systems Integrator, Systems Engineer and Architect.  The effort includes systems architecture engineering, Tactical Internet architecture design and development, integration, engineering with weapon platforms and ABCS syste ms, software and hardware design and development in support of the FBCB2 program.  The system is specifically oriented to provide individual tactical vehicles and platforms with Situational Awareness and Command and Control capabilities.  The main goal of the SE&I portion of the FBCB2 Program is the development of the version 7.0 Software.  Performance under this contract is scheduled to continue through September of 2004, to include the following tasks:  Systems Engineering and Integration; Program Managem ent; development of the system hardware and software to the objective capabilities as specified in the FBCB2 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and User Functional Description (UFD); perform Tactical Internet design engineering to achieve appropriate network performance; integrate application software; integrate and install the hardware and software into various Army platforms (to include with some platform sub-systems) at various Army locations; testing beyond Initial Operational Test and Evaluation ( IOT&E); develop logistics support plan including technical manuals/technical bulletins/interactive electronic manuals (TM/TB/IETM); maintenance of Logistics Management Information (LMI) database develop/update of support analysis plan to include maintenanc e planning; provisioning; maintenance data; migration of FBCB2 to pc computers and small computing devices; migration of FBCB2 architecture; provide strategic vision of future FBCB2; development of software functionality and documentation necessary to accr edit the FBCB2 system through the DITSCAP process.  Subsequent software updates are forecasted at least on an annual basis.  This effort builds onto ongoing software development.  Included also is Tactical Internet Management System (TIMS).  Evolution of T IMS “software application” and “associated products” from the Block 4 functionality to be demonstrated at IOTE to its objective capability as defined in the ISYSCON ORD.  ISYSCON (V)4/Tactical Internet Management System (TIMS) application development conti nues to support FBCB2 network management functions in the areas of Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) for Block 2 & Block 3 requirements.  TIMS continues to support S6 related FBCB2 functions.  TIMS development will continue to enhance the management of the Ta ctical Internet to include Situational Awareness monitoring based on future FBCB2 SA reporting implementation (i.e. SA over multicast), EPLRS monitoring, and future JTRS management requirements IAW the ISYSCON ORD.  The TIMS program will begin development of the Initialization Capability (IC) that will enable the soldier, without the assistance of a support contractor, to create, merge, and edit the FBCB2 and TIMS operational databases.  This capability is required to support FBCB2 block 3 and TIMS Block 5 requirements.  ISYSCON (V)/4 TIMS and Initialization Capability (IC) associate product development continues to support FBCB2 network management functions, UTR, enhanced TI management, situational awareness, EPLRS monitoring, and JTRS management.  TIMS is the Army’s Brigade and Below network management system.  The vendor must provide software maintenance for FBCB2 software versions 3.4 and 3.5, which are currently in use by the U.S. Army in 4 ID, 1CAV and IBCT.  Track software problems found in the field, in the Central Technical Support Facility, and in other contractor facilities.  Identify significant problems, develop software patches, manage distribution of software patches.  FBCB2 software baseline is approximately three million source lines of code composed from COTS, GOTS, and custom application software.  Currently, only limited software documentation is available. Blue Force Tracking (BFT):  This effort falls within the scope of work of the SE&I Contract specifically the area that describes the integration and installation of the hardware and software into various Army platforms (to include with some platform sub-sy stems) at various Army locations, as well as various testing and training requirements of the SOW.  Software engineering, configuration, and design work are a major portion of the BFT efforts.  BFT efforts differ from site to site and resulting centers are  necessarily unique to the various locations.  BFT efforts include, among other tasks, Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) architectures; message routing; prototype hardware; field support; Army Battle Command System (ABCS) inte gration; and, additional BFT support. System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SSE&I) effort:  The SSEI effort is a joint/collaborative approach to a “System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SSE&I)” effort targeted at ABCS version 7.0.  The SE&I team will coordinate systems engine ering across the contractor’s PEO C3T contracts and with other PEO C3T contractors.  The contractor shall lead and/or contribute to the following principal systems engineering tasks:  Solve critical user effectiveness issues; OPORD/OPLAN dissemination from  MCS to the balance of the ABCS architecture; overlay dissemination and consistency, Blue Situational Awareness, Red Situational Awareness, Fire support (call for fire), Medevac, and logistics reporting.  Engage peers from within TRW to help solve these is sues.  Express a clear Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the System of Systems.  Describe and develop key Operations Threads for ABCS 7.0.  Produce a unified CONOOPS document for ABCS 7.0.  Link CONOPS to a System Architecture and the software processes b etween the Battlefield Functional Area systems (BFAS).  Produce an Architecture Description Document for ABCS 7.0.  This includes specifying and documenting the hardware and software products in the ABCS 7.0.  Define and document the software interfaces in  the ABCS 7.0 architecture.  Define and execute the process of maintaining configuration control of these interfaces.  Define and Model the Data Architecture for ABCS 7.0.  Develop a top level Technology Transition Strategy that can be uniformly applied ac ross all systems. As stated earlier, this survey largely encompasses a continuation of previously approved sole source efforts with the addition of expanded capability for the objective version 7.0 software, TIMS, and BFT which, while considered within the technical scope o f the contract, the overall dollar value was not considered in the original market survey and/or the contract ceiling.  As such, no solicitation documents have been generated in relation to this notification and none are available for distribution.  Respon dents to this survey must identify their software development practices, as the Government requires state of the art, best business practices implemented.  Respondents must provide a Total System Responsibility (TSR) approach, to include any warranty or co ntractor logistics support that would be considered most effective for the Army.  Responses should be mailed to: U.S. Army, CECOM Acquisition Center, AMSEL ACCB-RT-K(MCD), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008 or e-mailed to: Michael.Doelling@mail1.monmouth.army.mi l.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Rough Order Magnitude for Smart Cards
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR A ROUGH ORDER MAGNITUDE (ROM) ONLY.  A detailed cost estimate is not requested or desired.  The U.S. Air Force Academy does not intend to award a contract at this time but will use the ROMs as a basis for the Governments decision on how to proceed with this action.  This information will be held in confidence by the Government and will be used for internal planning purposes only.  The system for the USAFA Falcon Card is currently out of date and needs to be replaced.  We are requesting a ROM from industry for a state of the art commercial system. The concept is for use of commercial, off-the-shelf equipment where possible that is non-proprietary and captures industry best business practices to replace and enhance the present day Falcon Card program. 

The smart card system will include present day Falcon Card features (smart chip, magnetic strip) and fold in a proximity card feature to provide building access.  In addition to the proxy card, the present software application, which is over eight years old, also needs to be updated and modernized from a proprietary system to a more open platform.  Hardware must include expandable capabilities for future uses.

Currently, cadets use a smart chip or bar code card known as the Falcon Card.   The card is issued to cadets shortly after their arrival at the Academy and is used by cadets for a variety of transactions throughout the tour of study.  The bar code on the card is used for library check-outs and for payment charges at Cadet Issue and the Cadet Tailor Shop.  After a cadets card is scanned, a software program pulls up the corresponding social security number enabling cadets to check-out or receive items.  In addition, the smart chip allows cadets to place money on the card for use in laundry rooms and copy machines. 

I.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:  
REQUIREMENT 1, PROXY CARDS:  
System provided must be commercial, off-the-shelf open-platform smart card with proxy capabilities.  The card must include a smart chip, proxy antenna, and magnetic strip (high-coercivity) on the back of the card (if required).  

The card must be set up elongated with a slot for a badge holder.  The card will be pre-printed with a high quality, colored background with an Air Force theme (actual design not specified) with an Air Force Falcon emblem embedded.  The card will need the capability to accept a high quality color photo, cadet name, class year, and a 3 of 9 barcode on the front of the card.  Card size needs to be CR80 and ODBC compliant.  There will also be a requirement to provide off-the-shelf/open platform blank proxy cards that do not have the smart chip and magnetic strip.  The first 5,000 Falcon cards (proxy, smart chip, and high-coercivity magnetic strip) and the first 2,000 cards without the smart chip and magnetic strip should be included with the systems price.

REQUIREMENT 2, SOFTWARE APPLICATION:  
An off-the-shelf/open platform software application that will be used to replace the present application shall be included.  The new application will be web-based when possible with the capability to network across a local area network for management purposes.  Application must support at least 25,000 cardholders.  Application must be expandable to support future requirements. 


REQUIREMENT 3, SOFTWARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:

A minimum of two electronic purses on the card shall be provided along with a means to securely manage all financial transaction and accounts from a centralized location (web based if possible).  Electronic purse accounts must allow for personal identification number protection (PIN) and the maximum dollar amount per purse must be controllable by the Government through the management software. 

A cash management function shall be included which shall consist of the following:

--Capability for cadets to place money on the card at a Cash 2 Card machine.

--Capability to identify by card serial number the amount of funds used at each station.

--Capability to determine by card serial number the balance remaining on the card to allow for reimbursement of the balance to the cadet in the event of a card being lost or stolen or should the chip not be readable

--Capability to automatically transfer balances from a lost, stolen, or old card to a new card.

--Capability to cancel lost and stolen cards. 

-- Capability of automated management notification in the event that an unauthorized user is attempting to use a deactivated card.
   
--Capability to archive all transaction in a data storage device and download information for funds disbursement.

--Capability to record a complete history record of all transactions of each card by date, name, card serial number, and location where the card was used.

--Capability to Identify all hardware and software interfaces to accommodate use of the purse function.

REQUIREMENT 4:
System shall interface with the existing Academys Oracle database and derive all pertinent cadet data from that database.  If required, a schema can be furnished by the Government.

REQUIRMENT 5, HARDWARE:

	Nevada City, CA  95959

Statement of Work for Year 2 of RAP Project


Summary
	
The contractor will assist Tahoe National Forest (TNF) in developing the Forest-wide Roads Analysis Process (RAP) while also training the relevant TNF (and other USFS) staff in the use of the decision-support tool and GIS. This will include refining the existing knowledge base with TNF staff, building in data from road databases, incorporating access points not included in the initial pilot project, running the model for all roads in the Forest and generating reports, developing the final RAP report, and developing a training manual. The products will be user-friendly for technically-adept audiences to assist in automated prioritization of roads for further attention, studies, or management action. The model will be run at the TNF Supervisor?s Office and other locations as needed.

Contractor should be familiar with the Sierra Nevada Framework, the Forest Service Roads Analysis Process, and general ecosystem processes and functions as related to roads.

All work must be completed by September 30, 2002.

Development of the decision-support system
The Pacific Northwest Research Station has developed an ?Ecosystem Management Decision Support System? (EMDS, 1999), which will be the program at the center of this project. Within EMDS a knowledge base is developed by the user based on the resources of concern, the processes that interact with or impact the resources, and how these impacts and interactions are expressed. (A knowledge base is a hierarchy of information and rules for interaction describing a system). Ideally this knowledge base will incorporate sufficient data to reasonably support the decisions being made, which can be the same thing as the amount of data available. The decision-support system and assessments will be conducted for the entire Forest and will be based primarily on the knowledge base developed by the Foresthill ID Team. This team identified data gaps that could be filled in the short-term. If this information and other data needed is available, the knowledge base will be updated.


Project phases/tasks

Task 1:	Develop map products and a dynamic tool to serve project level analysis and decision making
	This project will produce a map or set of maps that allow a transportation engineer or other technical staff at the Forest to ?click? on a road and find out why it received the evaluation score that it did. This will be used at the sub-regional and/or project level when management and investigation decisions are being made. Roads at high risk of causing environmental impact may need closer investigation or closure. These maps will be used for prioritizing management decisions and defending decision-making. The contractor will develop these clickable products and advise TNF staff in the development of maps that include the RAP, INFRA, and other information in one clickable form. In addition, the contractor will assist in creating a dynamic tool that can be readily updated with new spatial data and that can support management decisions for specific roads.

Timeframe:  Completion by 8/31/02

Task 2:	Development of the ?access network?
	From the initiation of this project, there has been an over-riding concern about access to points throughout the Forest in the face of a changingroad system. In this phase, the contractor will work with the IDT in defining the database of places requiring managed road access. The contractor will guide the IDT in the use of the points in developing a GIS coverage, incorporating the coverage into the RAP model, and producing a mapped network of access routes that have the lowest risk of environmental damage.

Timeframe:  Completion by 7/31/02

Task 3:	Final RAP development and presentation
	The contractor will assist in writing text and creating figures for the final RAP suitable for public presentation and future NEPA needs. The contractor will produce the final ?risk maps? for the report highlighting the places where road impacts are most likely to be occurring. The contractor will also be available to participate in presentations to the public as deemed necessary by the TNF Project Lead. The contractor will identify gaps in data and knowledge for the final RAP report.

Timeframe:  Completion by 9/30/02

Task 4:  Develop EMDS-RAP Manual
The contractor will write an EMDS user manual for roads analysis.  The manual 
will enable Forest or Regional staff to run the ecosystem risk portion of the roads analysis using corporate GIS data. It will be based on the EMDS 2.0/Arc View 3.2 combined software that has been most widely used. The manual will also describe constructing the knowledge base used to run the analysis.

Timeframe:  Completion by 9/30/02
