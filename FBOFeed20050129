<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  This requirement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334210 (formerly SIC code 3661) at a 1,000 size standard.
 
The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools materials, and other items and services necessary to support the requirement in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (S00) FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION SYSTEM (DODIIS) VOICE OVER IP (VOIP) SYSTEM

1.0 - INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Objective: Determine the VoIP feasibility and implementation in the DoDIIS Community.

1.2 Scope and Constraints: This effort covers the infrastructure to be located at each of the regional service centers (RSCs) and IP phones that will be required to support VoIP in the DoDIIS environment.  This infrastructure will operate at the TS/SCI level and will interconnect the NSA Secure Telephone System (NSTS).  There will not be any interconnection with the unclassified voice system or internet. The operational fielded VoIP networks existing within DoDIIS supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) must interoperate with the proposed VoIP system.

1.3 Background:  The DoDIIS community is comprised of DoD Intelligence community users that work at many locations around the world.  These users are supported by a world wide IT infrastructure that gives them the capability to collaborate, share, and disseminate information.  JWICS, described briefly below, is the transport network that supports this infrastructure.  The RSCs, also described briefly below, provide all the required common applications for these users.

1.3.1 JWICS: The Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) is the global backbone network for the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) providing direct support to a wide range of users -- from the policy makers, to the unified commands, to the Warfighters in the field. The JWICS network is also the primary Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) component of the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) Defense Information System Network (DISN). As such, it is a 24-hour-a-day; 7-day-a-week networked capability designed to meet the requirement for secure (TOP SECRET SCI) high speed multimedia communications.  JWICS supports 160 permanent user locations worldwide as well as over 40 deployable systems that are used by the Major Commands in all crises since Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  This is a closed network that does not interconnect to any public networks.  The services supported by the network include, but are not limited to: IP data transport, point-to-point and multipoint video teleconferences (VTCs), and video broadcasts.  The JWICS Program is now expanding the infrastructure to support Voice over IP (VoIP).  The DoDIIS VoIP infrastructure will be located at each of the Regional Service Centers (RSCs) or distributed within a 100 mile radius proximity of the RSC locations. DoDIIS currently has over 1150 VoIP phone endpoints supporting a critical operational network at CENTCOM.  Also, DoDIIS has over 40 deployable C-JWICS and JMICS tactical mobile units utilizing an operational VoIP network supporting OIF.  The proposed VoIP system must be able to place secure phone calls, connect, maintain calls without dropping while utilizing standard PBX features (listed in the DoDIIS technical requirements, section 1.15) into CENTCOM operational VoIP system and the C-JWICS/JMICS tactical VoIP network. 

1.3.2 RSCs: The DoDIIS Architecture will transition to a new IT organizational construct that implements geographically dispersed information management centers. The RSCs will provide the Defense Intelligence customers and analysts’ access to data, applications, and core services.  The RSC geographical regions and sponsors are as follows:  Washington, DC - Bolling Air Force Base; Tampa, FL – USCENTCOM; Colorardo Springs, CO – USNORTHCOM; Hawaii – USPACOM; Stuttgart, GE – USEUCOM.   The RSC will include IT capabilities and future data, applications and core services into the RSC domain based on the processes outlined in this document. 

1.3.2.1 Virtual vs. Physical RSC Architecture: The RSC implementation will be accomplished using a virtual, regional architecture. This “virtual” vice “physical” implementation approach allows each RSC to immediately exploit existing IT capabilities within its geographic region--not every RSC component needs to be physically collocated to be effective. As an example, in Europe the IT components could be located at Stuttgart, RAF Molesworth UK, and Naples IT. Over time some consolidation of IT capabilities and services will occur when cost or mission support benefits can be realized. The initial RSC locations were based on the location of JIVA components and will be evaluated over time to determine if adjustments are warranted.  The geographical location of a RSC or its component elements may change over time if for mission support purposes, cost, or disaster recovery concerns indicate that an adjustment is warranted. The DoDIIS VoIP infrastructure equipment will be located at each of the Regional Service Centers (RSCs) or distributed at another site within a 100 mile radius proximity of a RSC location as listed in paragraph 1.3.2.  The DoDIIS VoIP system must support load balance and automatic failover for calls and voice mail without human intervention to another IP PBX(s)/voice mail server(s) located within a 100 mile radius proximity of a RSC location or other distributed site. 

1.3.2.2 RSC Capabilities: Each RSC will provide a number of IT capabilities for its supported region. These capabilities are composed of critical GDIP mission applications, data, and core services that are shared or used by more than one organization. This may take the form of hosting the data and application within the RSC, providing access to the data through a portal or middleware hosted at the RSC, or by organizations providing access to the data on their external servers (e.g., Intelink). Other capabilities such as imagery and intelligence-related Command and Control applications such as the Global Command and Control System Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (GCCS-I3) will also be included in the RSCs. Initially, the core set of RSC capabilities provided will include the DMS, IDS, access to the JIVA community applications and tools, application and data recovery capabilities by embedding support from the DRP, and full use and access via the Full Service Directory (FSD) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) programs. As such, bandwidth conservation is critical to ensure these RSC applications will be readily available for users to support vital intelligence missions.

8.  Special Instructions.

i.  Part II – Technical Proposal Section

(A)   Offerors shall submit a six column matrix, incorporating Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements as the first column and adding the subsequent column headings: Hardware Components, Hardware GA Dates, Software Release, Software Release GA Date and Description of How Requirement is Fully Compliant by the proposed VOIP system.  The matrix shall be used as a tool to demonstrate the offerors compliance with each of the technical specifications.  Failure to provide the matrix will deem the contractor as non-responsive and therefore unacceptable.
     
ii.  Part I – Past and Present Performance Information Section.
      
The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror’s experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP.  The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as the Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.  Provide a list of at least three (3), but no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date that demonstrate your ability to perform the proposed effort.  Relevant contracts as defined under Evaluation Procedures for past performance.  Past performance demonstrating experience in pure IP deploying will be given a rating.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating “neutral”, meaning the rating is rated neither favorable nor unfavorably.

 iii.  PART III– Cost/Price Section.
	   
(A) Provide a complete design for the proposed VoIP system.  The complete design must be based on the technical requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) document, Appendix A, DoDIIS VoIP Technical Requirements, and the following information listed below:

(1) All core VoIP infrastructure hardware, software, and associated licensing cost for 30,000 users (6,000 IP phones per RSC)
(2) Failover architecture for 30,000 IP phones and associated licensing cost
(3) Voice mail for 10,000 users (2,000 users per RSC location)
(4) 2000 IP phones
(5) 2000 IP phone licenses
(6) Annual maintenance cost of all hardware and software 
(7) 24x7 telephonic maintenance support
(8) On-site personnel maintenance support as required
(9) Design and pricing shall not include use of exisitng VoIP GFE for existing operational networks

(B) Insert proposed unit and extended prices for each item in format listed in Appendix B, VOIP Cost Table. The offeror shall include an itemized list of proposed equipment with unit and total pricing. Any offeror, which fails to cite a price for each item, or fails to make an entry, which indicates an item will be provided at no charge, will be rejected as non-responsive to this solicitation.  Only firm-fixed price offers will be evaluated.  

Add Paragraph (l), Government Contract Files, the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals.  Unless the offeror provides written request otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies of such unsuccessful proposals. After contract award, unsuccessful proposals will be destroyed except for one copy, which will be retained with the contract file.  

 (1)  EVALUATION PROCEDURES.
 
(i)  Relevancy:  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  IAW AFFARS 5315.305(a)(2), the main assessment of relevancy focuses on and targets performance relevant to technical capability and price.  Relevancy will also take into account the offeror’s experience in performing similar functions under a single contract.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors’ and teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government will consider an offeror’s contracts in aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three present/past contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant technical effort and/or a relevant price effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when said contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in aggregate, the work more accurately reflects a very relevant effort in terms of technical and/or relevant in price.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

Very Relevant:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires and are currently ongoing or were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date. For example, exceeds total VOIP system IP user deployment (60,000 and above pure IP phones)

Relevant:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires and were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  For example, total VOIP system IP user deployment (50,000-59,000 pure IP phones)

Semi-Relevant: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires and were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  For example, total VOIP system IP user deployment (30,000-49,000 pure IP phones)

Not Relevant:  None of the above. 

(ii)  Recency:  Present/past performance programs currently ongoing or completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  Ongoing programs must have started no less than 6 months ago.

(c) Price Factor Assessment:  The offerors deemed technically acceptable will then be ranked according to price, lowest to highest.  This factor will not receive a rating.  
 
(2)  DESCRIPTION OF FACTORS.  

(a)  Description of Factor 1 - Technical Capability:

(1)  The technical team will evaluate the technical proposals based on an acceptable/unacceptable standard.  Discussions/negotiations may be held on technical proposals.  Each technical proposal will be reviewed and a determination shall be made as to whether it is acceptable or unacceptable based on the evaluation criteria described herein.  If a technical proposal is determined unacceptable, the offeror will be excluded from the competition and they will not progress to the next round of evaluations.  

(A)  This factor evaluates the offeror’s proposed technical capability to effectively accomplish the objectives set forth in the SOO.  Note: Evaluation will be based on IP technology only. Other technologies than IP will not be considered.
 
(B)  The standard is met when the contractor demonstrates it products compliance in Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements.  All requirements will be validated and scored as follows:

EXCELLENT - Exceeds specified capability in a beneficial way to the agency and has a high probability of satisfying the requirement; has no significant weakness.

SATISFACTORY - Meets evaluation standards; has good probability of satisfying the requirement; any weaknesses can be readily corrected.

MARGINAL - Fails to meet evaluation standards; has low probability of satisfying the requirement; has signficant deficiencies.

UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet the minimum requirement.

(b) Description of Factor 2 – Past and Present Performance Factor:

(1)  This factor identifies and reviews relevant present and past performance, and then makes an overall assessment of the Government’s confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the effort described in the RFP, based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The offeror’s proposal shall address performance in related functions of at least three (3), but no more than five (5), of the most relevant current and past contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date in the area of deploying pure IP phones.

(2)  In evaluating this factor, the Government will use the past performance information gathered from offeror(s)' provided references.  Verification of past performance information may be handled telephonically.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to use data independently obtained from other Governmental and commercial sources, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information.
 
(3) Offeror is cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors—Commercial Items.  Offeror’s may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

(c) Description of Factor 3 - Price Factor:
	
(1)  This factor will evaluate the cost proposal to determine the ranking of the proposed total price.

(2)  An offeror’s proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in Appendix B, VOIP Cost Table by the proposed unit price for each contract line item number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each CLIN.   All responsible offers that conform to the solicitation requirements will be ranked according to price, from overall low to high.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
