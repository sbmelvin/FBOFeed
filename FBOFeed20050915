<DESC>Sole Source Justification 
		for licensing the software application Meridian
	from Endeavor Information Systems Incorporated (EISI).
 
The National Agricultural Library (NAL) on behalf of USDA desires to acquire the Meridian software module from the Vendor named above, for use with the Voyager Integrated Library System (ILS) already in operation at the Library.  This Meridian module is designed to manage the library’s electronic journal subscriptions capturing information on the titles licensed, the financial details of the subscriptions, and the rights and permissions permitted by the license.  This electronic rights management (ERM) information will be displayed to authorized staff and where appropriate as part of NAL’s AGRICOLA public catalog.  The Meridian application is tightly coupled with the rest of the Voyager application and is able to extract and display data stored in other Voyager modules. EISI has not licensed any other vendor’s applications to permit direct access into their application for the collection and display of ERM information.  Therefore, Meridian is the only product available on the market that will satisfy the Government’s need.  Since the Meridian product is only available for EISI, the Government intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to EISI for Meridian.

In addition, the title company should be on the approved list of the U.S. Attorney General.  The Contractor will perform the same closing services as in a commercial transaction including disbursement of funds, obtaining and recording deeds, and any necessary, curative instruments to assure merchantable insurable title to the easement in the name of the United States of America, by and through the Secretary of Agriculture, to the wetland and/or grassland easement.

The closing services will be performed in the county courthouse of the county in which the wetland and/or grassland easement is located, unless the Contractor, landowner, and NRCS representative mutually agree to a different location.

The Contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with closing real estate transactions and title clearance.

The ALTA Closing Protection Letter 	Revised 3/27/87 is satisfactory to meet this condition of responsibility.  Evidence of liability must be provided prior to contract award.

Upon completion of the closing, the Contractor will send to NRCS the ALTA U.S. Policy Form 9/28/91, naming the United States of America, by and through the Secretary of Agriculture, as the insured, in the amount of the purchase price as of the date and time of recording of the Warranty Easement Deed to the United States of America.  The policy of title insurance will be free and clear of any and all encumbrances (exceptions) to the title except those shown as acceptable in the OGC Preliminary Opinion.  At the time of closing, the Contractor will provide a Settlement Statement to the landowner, in the form similar to HUD-1 (8-87) RESPA, HB 4305.2.

Upon receipt of the survey plat by the NRCS, the Contractor will forward the preliminary title package to the contracting officer at the NRCS state office within ten (10) business days.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration on behalf of Bureau of Economic Analysis intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with D.K. Shiflette & Associates, 7115 Leesburg Pike Falls Church, VA 22043.
 
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  

Description:  The Bureau of Economic Analysis has a requirement to provide the International Trade Administration (which funds production of the Travel & Tourism Satellite Account(TTSA)) with a complete and consistent set of travel and tourism estimates.   BEA is updating its TTSA’s for calendar year 2004.  BEA is seeking the same set of tourism-related data that were supplied by D.K. Shiflett & Associates, Ltd. (DKSA) to create the 1997-2003 TTSAs for calendar year 2004.  The primary goal is to secure the best, most comprehensive data as appropriate inputs consistent with the data provided to BEA for 1997-2003.  The DKSA data provide detailed measures of U.S. travelers’ spending both in and outside the U.S., U.S. Accommodations Volume, U.S. Domestic Vehicle Mileage, and U.S. Activities Volume.  The DKSA data is the best obtainable in terms of coverage, quality, frequency, reliability, and availability.  

DKSA is the only vendor capable of providing data that is fully consistent with the DKSA data used in prior years.  DKSA is also the only vendor found that can provide the full range of tourism-related data that we require.  If another vendor was used to produce the TTSA-related data, BEA would require these data not only for calendar-year 2004, but for calendar years 1997-2004, inclusive, in order to assure a consistent data series as required by the International Trade Administration.

Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities.  To be considered an affirmative response, all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  In your response you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.

The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items (the following evaluation criteria is listed descending order of importance technical, past performance, and price); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders; FAR52.217-8 Option to Extend Services; FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract; The FAR provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm.   
The CAR provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CAPPS_car.html. 
The following Department of Commerce provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:
1352.231-70, Duplication of Effort; 1352.233-70, Harmless from Liability; 1352.209-73  Compliance with the Laws; 1352.208-70, Printing; 1352.252-70, Regulatory Notice; 1352.209-71, Organizational Conflict of Interest; 1352.209-72; Restrictions Against Disclosure;1352.237-72 Security Processing Requirements for Contractor/Subcontractor Personnel Working on a DoC site(low and moderate risk contracts)

The period of performance for this effort is October 1, 2005 through December 15, 2005.  Forward response by September 20, 2005, via email to pearlette.m.merriweather@noaa.gov. Reference Solicitation No. BA513600500123. SEE NOTE 22 (6 day response applies to this acquisition).

The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (“AURA”), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, intends to solicit proposals to conduct Conceptual Design studies for a Wide-field Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (WFMOS). The instrument is intended to be developed collaboratively by the Gemini and Subaru Observatories. It is to be deployed on the Subaru telescope for the shared use of both astronomical communities. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued by AURA in September to institutions that submit a request to receive the RFP by 23 September 2005. Requests to receive the RFP should be sent by email to Andrew Flach, Gemini Contracts Manager, at aflach@gemini.edu, and should reference “N251227” in the subject line.  In the body of the email please give the name of your instuition and the contact information (name, email, street address, and telephone) for the person who will serve as your single point of contact for this procurement. Before submitting your request for the RFP please review the full announcement regarding this procurement which is available at the Gemini Observatory website  (http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=148).  The full announcement contains important information regarding the required allocation of the work among the Gemini Partner nations.

WFMOS is expected to provide spectroscopic observations of ~4500 targets simultaneously across a 1.5-degree field of view. The basic instrument concept relies on the use of a prime focus array of remotely positioned fibers that feed a large bank of spectrometers located off the telescope. This prime focus concept is driven by constraints of the existing top end of the Subaru telescope and the need to use common wide-field corrector elements for both WFMOS and HyperSuprime Cam (a separate wide-field imager being proposed by Subaru).  The Conceptual Design teams will need to work closely with both the Gemini and Subaru staffs to address key optical, mechanical, and control system interfaces, develop operational concepts, etc. 

The preliminary baseline performance requirements for WFMOS on Subaru include:

Wavelength Range: 0.39 – 1.0 µm
Field of View:  1.5 deg
Spatial Sampling: 1 arcsec fiber entrance
Spectral Resolution: R = 1800 - 3500 (3000 fibers) and R = 40,000 (1500 fibers)
Simultaneous wavelength coverage: 0.39 – 1.0 µm (low resolution spectrographs), >100 Å (high resolution) 
Simultaneous Targets: 4500
Detector operating modes: Standard readout or Nod and shuffle 
Please note that these requirements may be modified or expanded in the actual RFP and are only meant to give a general idea of the scope of the work.  Do not rely on the requirements stated in this announcement in performing any work.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional support services for the Specialized Information Services (SIS) on a sole source basis from Mr. Edward J. Burns, Altamonte Springs, FL. SIS plans to provide support to MR. Burns to build on specialized expertise as a Technical Lead in the development of the Mozilla WebClient Project, and expert familiarity with the Mozilla/FireFox browser.  The purpose of this agreement is to develop a browser plug-in for the Mozilla/FireFox browser that will be capable of performing meta-searching and clustering of search results from heterogeneous information sources with the same basic functionality as ToxSeek. This new browser plug-in will considerably reduce the infrastructure, bandwidth and processing requirements of ToxSeek searches. 

Historically, the Specialized Information Services Division (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has developed specialized search technologies to provide access to heterogeneous information resources. 

Increasingly, useful and reliable information of interest to NLM/SIS is available on the World Wide Web via Web-accessible databases outside of NLM/SIS. In order to continue its role as a focal point for providing access to toxicology and environmental health information of high quality and currency, NLM/SIS is pursuing R & D projects for the more effective utilization of distributed information resources in support of its mission by utilizing advanced server-based meta-search and search result clustering technologies as exemplified in the ToxSeek system.

The contractor has highly unique and specialized expertise in Mozilla WebClient development as the Technical Lead on the Mozilla WebClient Project. Mozilla WenClient is a critical component of the ToxSeek Java application system for interactions with the Mozilla Firefox browser.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI5127; and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-05. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure, on a sole source basis–using simplified acquisitions procedures laboratory services for vector retransformation and clone isolations as well as clone sequencing for the purpose of developing an HIV-1 vaccine under NIAID Project# Z01- AI-00851-04 (The Role of Viral Resevoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease.)  In order to develop such a vaccine, or other prevention method to stop the sexual transmission of HIV-1 it is necessary to identify and characterize the viruses that are being transmitted.  HIV-1 infected patients have a diverse population of viral variants (viral quasi-species), yet only a subset of these virions are transmitted sexually.  Sera from transmission pairs have been transferred to Virologic for a receptor use assay.  As a part of the study, the entire envelope gene has been amplified and cloned.  The vector used in this assay is proprietary information of Virologic and the clones are not transferable from their site. Virologic will complete Qty 22-vector retransformation and clone isolations; and Qty 176-GeneSeq HIV ENV gp sequencing of subsequent clones.  For the good of the government, the vendor should not be changed now because extraction and re-amplification of these rare transmission samples is not possible. Virologic has been used in the past to meet similar requirements form other donor samples. Consistency of processes and procedure is critical to avoiding interpretation of experimental results as a result of introduction of unknown variables.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541380; and the small-business size standard is $6 million dollars. This is a firm fixed-price contract, and the FOB terms are (Destination). These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Baltimore, MD.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00464 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The NAICS  and small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a time-and-materials purchase order.  STATEMENT OF WORK - Commercialization Training and Technical Assistance for Partnership for Clean Indoor Air Pilot  Projects.  This Statement of Work outlines tasks for the implementation of an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program to provide support to Partnership for Clean Indoor Air pilot projects and Partners to promote new technology that reduces indoor air pollution.  Specifically, the  Contractor shall build the capacity of local Partners to develop a robust business strategy framework with which to evaluate, roll out and monitor household energy programs aimed at reducing indoor air pollution (IAP) in developing countries.  The Contractor shall use easy to use, available, field  tested and proven materials to help Partners evaluate and select the right household cooking and/or heating technology based on customer needs, and ensure that a self-sustaining delivery system is in place to support the program scale-up.  The Contractor shall conduct regional workshops and provide  individual technical assistance to pilot project grantees, government programs, and non-governmental organizations in several countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE - The estimated period of performance for this requirement is from the date of award through  September 30, 2006. BACKRGOUND - Some three billion people worldwide burn traditional biomass (e.g., wood, dung, crop residues) and coal indoors for home cooking and heating. The number of people using these fuels is expected to rise substantially by 2020. According to the World Health  Organization, this widespread use results in the premature deaths of an estimated 1.6 million people each year from breathing elevated levels of indoor smoke, with women and children being most significantly affected.  Indoor air pollution from household energy ranks as the fourth leading  environmental health risk in poor developing countries.  In response to this challenge, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, along with other governments and organizations, launched the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in  September 2002.  The Partnership's mission is to improve health, livelihood, and quality of life by reducing exposure to indoor air pollution from household energy use.  The Partnership is focusing on four priority areas:  incorporating social and cultural practices to promote adoption of new  technology; developing local sustainable markets for improved technology; improving the design and performance of indigenous technologies; and monitoring indoor air pollution, health and other impacts of the interventions.  The EPA is funding projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to identify  and demonstrate effective approaches for increasing the use of clean, reliable, affordable, efficient, and safe home cooking and heating practices that reduce people's exposure to indoor air pollution.  This Statement of Work focuses on providing EPA and its global Partners a consistent approach  and a common vocabulary to expedite comprehensive assessments of local markets and devise appropriate regional strategies for implementing indoor air pollution programs.  In addition, it will provide the tools and techniques required to develop and manage a sustainable business model which can be  scaled up through the region, and a mechanism to share lessons learned and helpful tools among other members of the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air to support local market initiatives.  This type of information, training and technical assistance is vital for successful implementation of improved  household energy programs, and will form the basis of more effective regional and global solutions to indoor air quality management problems.  OBJECTIVES:  This Statement of Work has four objectives: 1) Implement an available, field tested and proven business strategy framework with selected  Partners to evaluate, roll out and monitor household cooking device programs aimed at reducing the level of indoor air pollution in developing countries; 2) At a minimum, the business toolkit should include the following components:  a) Macro Environment:  What is the local environment in which we  are operating? b) Customer & Demand: Who is our customer, how can we best serve them and what is the anticipated demand? c) Supply:  What is the best way to get the right product to the right place at the right price at the right time? and d) Sustainability & Scale Up:  How do we ensure that the  programme is sustainable and scalable?; 3) Build the capacity of local Partners to apply a business strategy framework to ensure that the local project provides a customer needs driven solution supported by a sustainable business model in order to provide maximum benefit to the IAP affected  households; 4)  Use the experience gained in selected geographies to help inform the regional and global strategies for the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air.  TASKS:  Task 1: Project Plan and Monthly Conference Calls - The Contractor shall provide the EPA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)  with a project plan and a schedule of activities within thirty (30) days of receipt of contract.  The contractor and EPA will have monthly conference calls to discuss implementation of the SOW.  Task 2: Project Launch - Facilitate initial workshop in each of the three regions (dates and locations  to be identified in consultation with COR and local Partners) to introduce the business strategy framework; Agree on work plan (schedule, resources, and tasks) including the level of support required to each of the local Partners in the relevant region.  Once the level of support is determined, the  Contractor will feedback to the COR whether the allocation of days to that specific local Partner is appropriate or whether it should be increased or decreased.  Based on the recommendation, the COR will agree with the Contractor on any reallocation of the total consultancy days and corresponding  updates to the program plan; Start initial data gathering and walk through the templates for each module of the business toolkit.  Task 3: Data Collection & Analysis - During this activity, the Contractor will provide support to the local Partner to complete the following activities:  Collect data  for analysis of macro environment, customer and demand, supply, and sustainability modules of the business strategy framework; Analyze data for macro environment and customer and demand modules; Weekly conference calls/status reports between Contractor and local Partner to monitor progress and  manage identified risks regarding the timing for the project and scope; Remote support (e-mail and telephone) by Contractor to local partner during the period of this project.  Task 4: Market Strategy Support - The Contractor will work with the local partner to support the development of the supply  and sustainability modules and assist in the data analysis and interpretation of results.

Maintaining the health of a population requires a myriad of expensive interventions. Along with medical care, a number of socio-economic factors contribute toward health. Given their complexity and cost, expenditures for health must necessarily be prioritized.   

Public involvement in health policy has encountered a number of obstacles.  When feeling well, most individuals find that the issues lack salience, so decisions tend to be influenced heavily by health care workers.  Patients may be frustrated by the complexity of information and rely on physicians and insurers to decide for them, trusting the services they need will be provided to them in the event of illness. At the community or organizational level, the lack of consumer understanding and involvement in policy making has been identified as a serious impediment to a market-based health care system with a solid moral foundation. Over the last 8 years the Section on Ethics and Health Policy of the Department of Clinical Bioethics at the NIH has engaged in a project to design, and use decision tools that involve members of the public in resource allocation decisions for health care and other interventions aimed at ameliorating health.

While this effort has involved the accomplishment of many technical tasks such as game design, software development, and data collection and analysis, we have focused insufficient attention on a theoretical justification for the idea that the ascertainment of the public’s perspective should lead to public participation in policy setting.
To prepare a manuscript providing a theoretical justification for public participation in priority setting for health.
The contractor will be required to review the relevant literature, develop an outline for a manuscript, write and submit the manuscript for publication.
The Contractor, working closely with the project officer, will do the following work for the project: Review literature, Prepare a manuscript outline, Write a manuscript, Submit for publication and revise as necessary
Contractor will confer on a weekly or biweekly basis with the investigator to review the purpose of the study and plan the manuscript and to review the progress of the project. 
Progress Reports – The Contractor will submit to the Project Officer a progress report every month. The progress report will include: a description of the work to date, problems encountered, suggested resolution, hours of labor and other costs expended, and a comparison of planned project schedule to actual project schedule.

<DESC>The National Capital Planning Commission is seeking qualified planning firms with expertise in parks, recreational and open space comprehensive planning/master planning for a large city; parks and open space needs and assets assessment; landscape architecture; and the development of ordinances, regulations and codes.

The scope of work focuses on comprehensively assessing federal and District parks and open space needs within Washington, D.C., establishing a shared planning and organizational framework for federal and District agencies, and proposing strategies that will allow each agency’s individual actions to work in concert towards a seamless system of parks and open space that meet future national and local needs.  

The Consultant will work with NCPC to establish a vision and framework of goals and opportunities that will shape a physical framework plan of parks and open spaces.  This work includes identifying major parks systems and corridors; updating and supplementing existing park and open spaces data; establishing typologies and open space standards specific to Washington D.C.; conducting an assessment to identify key assets and establish priority needs for parks and open spaces that addresses issues of quantity, quality, distribution, competing users, lack of connections and access; and summarizing this information in a “State of the District Parks and Open Space” report.

In addition, the Consultant will develop a physical plan for Washington’s parks and open spaces that focuses on land and physical resources.  The plan will produce: design concepts, access and site improvement recommendations; use and programming strategies and site control proposals; strategies for achieving green spaces of the highest design quality contributing to the identity and sense of place in our public spaces, including significant streets, historic parks, neighborhood parks and major park corridors; strategies for meeting multiple user needs and accommodating national and local interests; and priorities for future federal and local investments and actions, including land acquisition, site control, and facility and grounds improvements.  

The Consultant will also establish an action agenda that assigns implementation responsibilities, and identifies resources, phasing and priorities, to move forward on: identifying opportunities to develop and improve working relationships and partnerships; developing planning and regulatory tools, including model guidelines or regulatory language for landscape and streetscape treatments, zoning, and applications for obtaining green spaces through development processes; identifying priorities for federal and District land acquisitions, transfers, or dispositions; and developing cost estimates for standard capital improvement elements and other implementation recommendations.  

Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria, which are listed in order of importance:  (1) Professional and technical qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including planning skills necessary to aid NCPC in producing all products of the initiative. (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Past performance will also be evaluated based on the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation under contracts that required subcontracting plans.  (5) Knowledge of the geographical area and local working relationship between the federal government and the District of Columbia; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  (6) Participation of small business (e.g., Woman Owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business), small disadvantaged businesses, and historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions, in the proposed contract team, measured as percentage of the estimated effort.  (7) Cost.  

This acquisition is made pursuant to Subpart 15 of the FAR that governs competitive negotiated acquisitions. 

The proposed period of performance is 84 weeks.  

Type of contract:  Firm-fixed price.  

The estimated budget for this effort is not to exceed $300,000. 

The draft Scope of Work is available at www.ncpc.gov/what.html or by contacting Angela Roach, Contracting Officer, National Capital Planning Commission, 401 Ninth Street, NW, Suite 500 North, Washington, DC  20004.  Telephone Number:  202-482-7235. Fax Number 202-501-2550.  E-mail address: angela.roach@ncpc.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement is to provide notice that a small business set aside, sole source commercial award under FAR Part 13.5, to BSM, Inc., 32 Elmwood Drive, Kennett Square, PA 19348 is anticipated.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAI CS) code is 541710, with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The impending procurement is to provide the Joint Program Manager-Biological Defense, Joint Biological Standoff Det ection System (JBSDS) Program Office, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, with the necessary nonpersonal services to provide Analytical and Technical support required to directly support the JBSDS program effort against the war on terrorism and efforts related t o the defense against biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction.  The JBSDS system will be capable of providing near-real-time detection and discrimination of biological aerosol clouds and early warning of exposure to BW agents.  LIDAR (Light Dete ction and Ranging) is the technology approach that has been developed for the JBSDS Increment I System.  The expected value of this action is less than $2 million (Base year and four option years), and expected not more than 1 man year of total effort prov ided per year.  Because of the critical nature of this procurement and because the current contractor has the institutional memory, background and highly specialized experience required to ensure the success of this critical effort within the mandated time  lines, a non-competitive award to BSM, Inc., is intended.   Only one responsible source is available without incurring substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  Fir ms that believe they can provide this service must provide written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform these services, which clearly documents qualifications of their personnel regarding the LIDAR technology noted above, within 10 days after publication of this notice.  Current top secret clearance is also required.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  Upon review of the responses, a determination by the Government not to compete this  proposed acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following
factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical, price, delivery, and past performance.  Technical:  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description as specified above that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Price:  Price will be evaluated for realism.  Delivery:  Offerors shall discuss whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements; proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Past Performance:  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references shall be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references shall be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.

The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description as specified above that highlights specifications and qualifications).  The technical quote will be more significant than the price quote.  Delivery schedules will not receive any scoring but will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Price and past performance are of equal importance.

Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFP requirements will not be sufficient.  Proposals must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

(b) Options:  Not applicable

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of provision)

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract, with desired staggered delivery commencing 60days after receipt of order.  The vendor must state actual delivery time in the offer.  

All interested, responsible firms should submit quotes (original plus one redacted copy of quote and applicable documentation in accordance with FAR 52.212-1) no later than 5:00 P.M. (Baghdad Time), 5 October, 2005, to the following email address:  walter.walter@pco-iraq.net.  Questions in regards to this quotation shall be directed in writing to Mr. Walter at email walter.walter@pco-iraq.net. Faxed quotes will NOT be accepted.

Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX) Automation

Posted:  15 Sep 05  Closing Date:  13 Oct 05

The Joint Contracting Command – Iraq/Afghanistan has a requirement to select a System Integrator (Contractor) for the installation, implementation, and training of software and specification of hardware for the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX) and the Depository (D).  This RFP includes the selection or procurement of software but excludes the procurement of hardware, other than providing specifications for the purchase of hardware for Government approval, which the Government will either provide to the Contractor or have the Contractor procure as an option line item.  The ISX is striving to re-establish its presence among Middle Eastern stock markets through the use of contemporary technology and superior service to brokers, listed companies, and investors alike.  Specifically, the provisions of the present law include graduation from the current manual trading floor of the ISX to an automated trading system; de-centralization of the trading function; de-materialization of traded securities through the permanent assignment of stock certificates in a Depository; establishment of a share registry to coordinate with the depository to expedite the settlement of trades to conform with international “best-practices”; and implementation of software that facilitates a trading, settlement, clearing, and depository system (the System).  The System should be able to handle both Arabic and Latin characters for input/output.  The ISX's goal is to establish an orderly, liquid, and efficient stock market by expediting securities settlements through de-materialization; minimizing settlement risks through a delivery-versus-payment protocol; instilling public and investor confidence through transparent pricing; reducing operating expense burdens by accommodating high trading volumes, reducing the impact of fixed costs through automation, and eliminating much of the paperwork of the current manual system; connecting the ISX with the Iraq Securities Commission (ISC), the Depository, and the Central Bank via the Wide Area Network (supplied by the Offeror) thereby facilitating effective oversight; and de-centralizing brokerage operations away from the trading floor via the Wide Area Network.

The Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO) is engaged on behalf of the Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX).  The essential components of the effort are: 1.) the delivery of a software package that meets all of the requirements set forth in this RFP of functionality for the ISX; 2..) the installation and implementation of electronic trading systems for the Iraq Stock Exchange; and 3.) an electronic Clearing, Settlement, and Depository system for a Depository facility.  Another essential component of this RFP will be: 4.) training and related deliverables for all involved staff at the ISX, the Depository (D), and others designated. Computer hardware to support the operation of the trading systems of the ISX and the clearing, settlement, and depository functions of the D will either be provided by the Government or purchased from the Contractor as an option.  This RFP establishes detailed business, operational, and technical requirements to be distributed to potential Contractors.  The ISX seeks to automate the securities market life cycle from the trade through to the settlement.  The Contractor selected under this RFP will be obligated to provide ten (10) essential services to the ISX:  Identify and deliver software for the automation of the ISX that meets all of the required functionality and specifications noted in this RFP;  Develop detailed specifications for the hardware to be used in automation that is best suited, both economically and technically, to the supplied software and deliver the hardware at the Government’s option;  Build a Wide Area Network for the operations of the ISX and the D;  Oversight and installation of a fully automated trading, clearing, and settlement system and the creation and installation of a depository system (all are to be referred to as the System);  Follow-up refinement of the newly installed System including making necessary and desired modifications for present users’ needs and configuration requirements, and to eliminate programming errors and procedural inefficiencies;  Utilizing the Wide Area Network provided by the Contractor, insure that the installation of the software and the hardware enable total connectivity with other key end-users including, but not limited to, the ISX, banks, the ISX Board of Governors (BOG), the Iraq Securities Commission (ISC), and other entities as identified; Utilizing the Wide Area Network provided by the Contractor, to insure that the installation of the software and the hardware enable confirmed trading transactions away from the ISX;  Up-grading of the skill-base of current and incoming ISX training staff and all users to effectively operate the advanced Systems and to provide inter-active data feeds to the ISC and other outside parties critical to the governance of Iraq’s capital markets; Review and modify as necessary the operating manuals (develop operations & maintenance and training manuals) to be provided to all the users of this System insuring that comprehensive manuals are provided that meet a wide variety of user’s needs and;  Provide a one month help desk for responsive and effective support for the required period after installation is complete; assisting the users with all issues that arise from the installed software.  Any interested party with advance knowledge of this Request for Proposal or who participated in the development of the requirement will be declared non-responsive.  Proposals will be evaluated using best value methods.  Further details are available in the RFP.

<SUBJECT>30 -- Rectifier Transformers for the AGS Main Magnet Power Supply
<SOLNBR>AGSTXF1
<RESPDATE>092305
<ARCHDATE>10082005
<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>********** This Amendment, extends the date for which responses are due for this RFP, from 4:00 pm, 16 September 2005 until 4:00 pm, 23 September 2005.**********
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) operates a fully controlled 72 MW DC power supply, which energizes the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) Main Ring Magnet system.  The Magnet system represents a 0.75 Henry, 0.25 Ohm load.  The controlled rectifier assembly is feed from a 95 MVA Motor Generator Set through eight phase shifting / step-down rectifier transformers.  The secondaries of each of these transformers are bifilar wound, so that there are 16 secondary windings in total.   BNL will solicit bids to replace the existing rectifier transformers with new units.  It is critically important that the prospective Vendor have extensive experience with rectifier transformer of this size and service and a thorough understanding of how these transformers interact with the Motor Generator set.  The prospective Vendor shall insure that the new Transformers are completely compatible with the existing rectifier modules and the Motor Generator Set.  The Vendor shall build and thoroughly test and document the transformers.  BNL will install the transformers with engineering supervision by the Vendor.  The Vendor shall participate in the commissioning and turn on of the systems after the new transformers are installed.

Operating Parameters:
The Transformers will be operated 24 hours per day 7 days per weeks 10 months per year.  The operating cycle will drive the rectifiers to full rectify and then to full invert continuously with a repetition rate of from 1 cycle per second to 1 cycle in 10 seconds.  During each cycle power will flow from the transformers to the magnet load and then from the magnet load back through the transformers to the Motor Generator Set.  In one typical cycle the DC current will rise from 200 amperes to 6000 amperes in 500 milliseconds and then immediately return to 200 amperes in an additional 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 1.1 seconds.  In another cycle the current will rise from 200 amperes to 4500 amperes in 500 milliseconds and stay at 4500 amperes for 6 seconds and then return to 200 amperes in 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 9 seconds.  The transformers must be designed and braced to handle this service, including the harmonics generated by the rectifier modules.  The transformers must fit the footprint of the existing transformers.  Any modifications required to the existing transformer yard will be prohibitively expensive.   

Specific requirements for the transformer are:
1)  		Eight phase-shifting / rectifier transformers each with bifilar secondary windings.  These transformers will be housed in four tanks suitable for outdoor service.
2)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 431 volt (output), 2.65 MVA.  These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
3)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 2288 volt (output), 11.5 MVA.   These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
4)      Four transformers will be connected via cable and four will be connected via circular aluminum bus.
5)		The lower power rated transformers will have no load manually selectable taps at 100%, 90% and 80 %.  These will be full current taps. 
4)       Delivery of the transformers shall be within 10 months after receipt of order.

This Request for Proposals (RFP)will be a Best Value with trade-offs procurement based upon price and other factors.

<SUBJECT>A--Low Cost Ferroelectric Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays Clarification to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401
<SOLNBR>DAAB07-03-R-P650
<RESPDATE>030504
<ARCHDATE>10192005
<CONTACT>Charles Ade, (732) 427-1334
<DESC>Low Cost Ferroelectric Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays Clarification to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401 See the US Army CECOM Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at abob.monmouth.army.mil under BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401, Amendment A00006  MS Word attachment for fine details or clarifications to the description of this Topic reflected below.  1.1 ARMY NEED:  The Army is pursuing technologies to meet transformation goals of a lighter, faster, more lethal force with integrated on-the-move communications from sensor to shooter.  Affordable Phased Arrays provide the means for this high data rate, B eyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS), on-the-move communications.  The Army Objective Force and Transformational Communications Architecture require small, low profile, affordable, mobile SATCOM terminals. The major contributor to the cost of phased array antennas i s the current high cost ($50-100) of packaged Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) phase shifters.  Ferroelectric phase shifters provide a low cost option for these costly items. The successful completion of this ManTech program will result in a cost reduction of up to 33% for SATCOM and UAV phased arrays for FCS and WIN-T operating in the K, Ka and Q frequency bands.  PM efforts affected include the WIN-T communications vehicle an d PM WIN-T Multifunction Integrated SATCOM Terminal (MIST).  Neither of these efforts will be able to utilize phased array antenna systems without the cost reductions provided by this ManTech program. 1.2 TECHNICAL CONCEPT:  This ManTech program leverages and builds upon DARPA, ARL and CECOM programs addressing the development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  Specific programs include the DARPA Frequency Agile Materials for Electronics (FAME) program, the ARL SBIR program for development of ferroelectric phase shifters, and a subcontract for ferroelectric phase shifters under the CECOM DUST (Dual Use Science & Technology) program for low cost phased arrays (STO IV.G.07, Antennas Across the Spectrum and STO IIII.C4.2001.02, Advanced Antennas).  These efforts, however, only address the initial development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  This ManTech program is expected to reduce costs by establishing cost effective manufacturing methods and techniques of  fabrication and packaging. Specific goals of this ManTech program are to:  Ã‚Â·	Improve device design and fabrication processes Ã‚Â·	Reduce device application voltage Ã‚Â·	Reduce loss of ferroelectric devices from 9 dB to  5 dB Ã‚Â·	Develop low cost packaging techniques Ã‚Â·	Package-less solder bump bonded ferroelectric phase shifter Ã‚Â·	Increase operational lifetime to  20 years Ã‚Â·	Reduce phase shifter device cost from $50 to $10. 1.3 BENEFITS:  This effort will yield significantly less expensive (from  $50 to  $10) phase shifters for phased array antennas.  Additionally, it will identify potential low-cost technologies for robust, mobile, embedded antenna systems that can replace t he current high-cost solutions.  These cost reductions will help reduce antenna costs to a level where it becomes practical to utilize these antennas extensively in tactical communications systems.  The ultimate goal of this ManTech program is to make the procurement costs of Phased Array Antenna systems feasible for the WIN-T and FCS communications architectures (including FCS UoA (Unit of Action) and UoE (Unit of Employment) vehicles with embedded SATCOM).  These antenna systems will provide a new high da ta rate, On-The-Move communications capability via Satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  (This capability is specifically addressed in the WIN-T ORD and the FCS Block II requirements.)  Affordable phased array antennas are a key component of the Transf ormation Communications (TC) terminal technology insertion/phasing plans.  As part of TCS, the Transformational SATCOM (TSAT) terminals include the technology insertion of phased array antennas in the 2005 -  2009 time frame.  Having phased array antennas in these terminals will increase communications capability and decrease the probability of enemy detection/identification because of their smaller, conformal profile. This ManTech program will develop low cost materials, novel techniques and manufacturing processes that can be applied to high volume production of ferroelectric materials/devices for phased array antennas.  The On-the-Move SATCOM and UAV communication systems enabled by this program represent a new and unique communication system for the FCS Warfighter in the field.  The use of the ferroelectric phase shifters will reduce the size, weight and power consumptio n of phased array antennas.  Reliability is also expected to increase, although system reliability will still be limited by performance of MMIC power amplifiers.  (There are concurrent efforts to address this component.) 2.1 SCHEDULE:  This effort will start in FY 04 since the technology is mature enough to enter the ManTech program.  The first set of ferroelectric phase shifter device samples are required no later than six months from the start of the program.  Four addit ional sets of samples are required at 6-month intervals (total of five (5) sets).  This allows time for analyzing each batch and modifying the design and manufacturing processes to overcome problems.  Initial samples will be for the 18.5 to 21.2 GHz freque ncy range, followed by samples at 27.5 to 31 GHz and 43.5 to 45.5 GHz.  These frequency ranges are those required by PM WIN-T and FCS for use with Global Broadcast System, Wideband Gapfiller, MILSTAR and Advanced EHF satellites.  Packaging issues are addre ssed from the outset (and throughout the duration) of the program.  Advances in design and manufacturing processes must justifiably result in reduced loss, increased reliability and yield, and lower phase shifter cost.  Reliability testing will be conducte d on all samples.  Benchmark testing procedures will be developed to demonstrate and compare the performance of the actual ferroelectric components against predefined goals for performance, yield, reliability and operational lifetime.  Please note that dur ing the sample device testing sequence, devices will be randomly selected, enclosed in suitable packages, tested and analyzed. 2.2 PERFORMANCE:  Improved performance is an integral part of this program.  Note: Failure to meet the goals established in this SOW may lead to reduced funding for the ManTech program.  The following are the performance requirements which are required to be reported to US Army R&D Command on a quarterly basis:         FY05		   FY06	           FY07		       FY08 1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss	 9dB	        7dB	               6dB		           5dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Yield	35%	        50%	               60%	           80% Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Cost	 $50	        $30	               $15                      $10 2.3 Electrical Requirements: Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss			 Ã¢Â€Â“	18.5 - 21.2 GHz						3.0-5.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	27.5 - 31.0GHz						3.5-5.5 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	43.5 - 45.5 GHz						4.0-6.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Return Loss								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Isolation								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output								50 ohm microstrip Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift						400 degrees min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Variation over temp, voltage			Less than  11 degrees Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss variation over temp, voltage			Less than   3 dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	RF Power Handling Capability					100 mw Watt CW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed						Less than 300 nanosecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Total Settling Time					Less than 1 microsecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage					Less than 30 Volts Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption					Less than 4 mW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching								Hot (RF applied) Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion						-22dBc Ã¢Â€Â¢	Size									0.8 x 1.7 mm max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Operational Lifetime					Less than 20 years 2.4 Test Methods (per MIL-STD 883E and MIL-PRF-38535J): Ã¢Â€Â¢	Screen Ã¢Â€Â“	Vi sual Inspection			M2010 Ã¢Â€Â“	Physical Dimensions			M2016 Ã¢Â€Â“	Stabilization Bake			M1008	Cond B, non-operating Ã¢Â€Â“	Thermal Shock				M1011.9	Cond B  -55oC to + 125oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Constant Acceleration			M2001.2	15,000G, Y1 axis only Ã¢Â€Â“	Serialization Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Pre Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Burn-In						M1015.9	Cond B Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Post Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Percent Defective Allowable					5%, all lots Ã‚Â·	Group A  Electrical Tests Ã‚Â·	Static								-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Return Loss Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Impedance Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage 	Dynamic							-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Shift vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Settling Time Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Handling Capability Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion Ã‚Â·	Seal						M1014 Ã‚Â·	External Visual					M2009 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group B Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Resistance to Solvents		M2015 Ã¢Â€Â“	Bond Strength			M2011 Ã¢Â€Â“	Die Shear Strength			M2019 Ã¢Â€Â“	Solderability				M2003 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group C Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Life					M1016	TBD* Hours @ +TBDoC 									100 mw min RF power Ã¢Â€Â“	End-point electrical parameters *  Accelerated life test conditions will be proposed/developed by the offeror and approved by the Government to justify 20-year operational lifetime.

<DESC>Amendment 001 is issued to make corrections in the requirements of the solicitation on pages 6 and 9, deleting any reference to the term “collar.” The required boat is an inflatable hull and the term “collar” is typically used in conjunction with “rigid inflatable boats” which is not desired in this case. In addition, clarification was provided on page 6 with regard to CBP’s requirement for “isolated” chambers or compartments, such that if one or more become deflated due to puncture, cuts, etc., the remaining chambers or compartments remain inflated, providing floatation for the boat. See amended replacement pages 6 and 9 to be inserted in the solicitation.

Interested firms are encouraged to download the amendment for complete details. 

The offer quotation due date and time has been extended until Monday, September 26, 2005, 2:00pm, Dallas, TX local time. 

 * * * In addition, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is contemplating adding new requirements to this solicitation calling for the acquisition and delivery of items similar to existing CLINs 00010, 00020, and 00030 but for performance of the associated training in Podgorica, Montenegro, as follows:

New CLIN 00040	Boat and engine, same as CLIN 00010, 4 or more;
New CLIN 00050	Training same as CLIN 00020, 1 each;
New CLIN 00060	Spare engine, same as CLIN 00030, 1 or more;

Once CBP confirms these requirements, an amendment to the solicitation will be issued (www.fbo.gov) listing the total requirements for each destination. This amendment will be issued on or about September 22, 2005, to confirm the final requirements. Interested firms should already be developing quotations for CLINs 00010, 00020, and 00030 as they remain in effect. In the interim, interested firms should also develop pricing and delivery information for providing items in response to proposed CLINs 00040 through 00060, if these new requirements are confirmed. As in the case of CLINs 00010 and 00030 above, all equipment items including CLINs 00040 and 00060 if required, will delivered to a Virginia, USA location.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions submitted by potential offerors. No additional questions will be accepted. Q1. Will there be additional detailed requirements or specifications that are made available? Response: There are no additional requirement or specifications that the Gov’t can make available. As stated in the solicitation notice, the tester the Gov’t is seeking is a commercial item capable of testing a COTS transmission. Additional information, if required, should be sought from the manufacturer of the transmission. Q2. Is there any other detailed design information for the product that will help in defining the test equipment that would be required? Response: See the answer to Question 1. Q3. Are there detailed test requirements available for the actual tests that the tester will have to perform? Response: There are no detailed test requirements available for the actual tests the tester will have to perform. The tester, using a commercial transmission tester, will test all parameters of the COTS transmission as specified by transmission manufacturer and in accordance with tester’s Operator Maintenance/Technical Manual. Q4. Is it possible for visits in person to review documentation and define requirements? Response: As this requirement is for a commercial item, the Gov’t has not determined a need for discussions or additional requirement definitization. The response date and time remains unchanged.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Repair, Upgrade and Modernize the Audio/Visual and Telecommunicatins Equipment which was posted on September 2, 2005. You are notified that the following changes are made: Answers to questions are as follows: 1.  Is installation of the equipment listed in the "Custom Room Integration" being requested in the solicitation?     Answer: Installation is only being requested for line item      #7 (VSX 7000e -- BTC System) 2.  If the only installation required is for the Polycom equipment, what configuration is that equipment to be installed in (i.e. single monitor, tied into projection system, Integration with Extron Switcher)?     Answer: Please refer to the drawings on Pages 7 & 8 of the Upgrade Spec Document (See VTC) 3.  Is the company expected to include the programming of the Creston control system?  I notice that we aren't installing it, but I wasn't sure if we are to provide the programming of it or not.      Answer: No 4.  Is this an All or None bid      Answer: Yes 5.  Who is the manufacturer of the CP1100-01 Ultra GT Compact Keyboard Suite?      Answer:  Gyration, Inc. 6.  If our prices on the requested equipment is lower than those of the companies quoting the equipment with the installation of it (we would still be meeting the extended warranty requirement) is there a possibility that the award would be split (1 for installation/service & 1 for goods)?     Answer:  We do not anticipate splitting the award.	Awarding      will be on an all or none basis as is stated in Question #4 7.  There was Middle Atlantic equipment on the original RFQ - this equipment is not on the official solicitation - is this a typo, or was it intentionally left off?      Answer:  According to the solicitation, items are identical       to those of the written request for quotation, therefore,      please refer to the listed items that are submitted      in the Written Request for Quotation.  8.  On item 18, which Crestron accessories are you looking for?     Answer:  Accessories should be applicable to items      companies are proposing.	       The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). [INSERT ANY APPLICABLE NOTES]

<DESC>TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) located at White Sands Missile Range, NM intends to add a three month extension and an option for an additional three months to their contract with Advanced Systems Technology, Inc. (AST).  This extension is necessary to  cover services while the ACA-NR Contracting Office awards a new contract and to cover a phase-in period if required.  It is not feasible to contract with any other company to perform these services during this period.  All others would require a transitio n period that would leave TRAC without full-service coverage for 1-2 months and cost about $500,000 for actual costs and as much as another $500,000 in cancelled or unsupported missions.  In addition there are several hundred lines of Government Furnished Property that would have to be 100% inventoried and transitioned to a new contractor and would cause further delays. Performance by any other contractor would not be performance or cost beneficial to the Government. Note 22.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a market survey to determine potential sources.  The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Global Information Grid Systems Group, Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Office (GIGSG/KM) is seeking a qualified contractor for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), to include both hardware and software, for the Defense Injection/Reception Emergency Action Message Command and Control Terminal (DIRECT) (formerly the Defense IEMATS Replacement Command and Control Terminal) for mid-FY06 through mid-FY07 with options for mid-FY07 through mid-FY10.  DIRECT was developed, produced, and installed by General Dynamics C4 Systems (formerly GTE Government Systems), Needham, MA, under contract F19628-96-C-0126.  General Dynamics is currently providing CLS under contract F19628-01-C-0053.  A Bridge contract for the period Sep 05 - Feb 06 is expected to be awarded to General Dynamics in the very near future.  Seven systems are currently installed in Nuclear Combatant Commander command centers at NMCC, NMCC Site R, USJFCOM, USSTRATCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USEUCOM.  Additional systems may be added to alternate locations in the future.  An additional system resides at General Dynamics as a development/test and sustainment system.  DIRECT consists of both commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment and equipment designed and built by General Dynamics.  DIRECT utilizes a two-level maintenance concept--organizational and depot.  Organizational level hardware maintenance will be performed by contractor on-site technicians in TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI facilities and will consist of system restoration by fault verification/isolation, removal/replacement of the faulty Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and functional checkout using existing technical manuals and other technical data.  Potential sources must provide appropriately cleared maintenance technicians at each site which can be utilized on an on-call-as-required basis to support DIRECT.  For newly designed equipment, depot level hardware maintenance will consist of diagnostic analysis, using contractor-provided common support equipment, of returned LRUs to isolate faulty Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs), the removal and replacement of faulty SRUs, and functional checkout.  SRUs in most instances will consist of circuit cards, power supplies, or fiber optics transmitters/receivers.  The CLS contractor will determine the most cost-effective means of repair for each COTS hardware item consistent with meeting required system performance criteria and availability of commercial technical data.  A commercial drawing package, an organizational level maintenance manual, and depot troubleshooting procedures for General Dynamics-designed LRUs are available.

<DESC>1.	Purpose

The U.S. General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Governmentwide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget OMB, seeks information related to government-wide efficient and effective information retrieval and sharing.  The objective of this initiative is to identify and promote the most cost-effective means to search for, identify, locate, retrieve, and share information, and assess the net performance difference (including cost-benefits) of assigning metadata and/or a controlled vocabulary to various types of information versus not doing so.  That is, does current search technology perform to a sufficiently high level to make an added investment in metadata tagging unnecessary in terms of cost and benefit? This objective is characterized throughout this RFI using various terms including most commonly retrieval and sharing.  Such terms refer to the complete objective.   

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services.  Please be advised that the government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. 
 
Please mark any proprietary or confidential information as such in your response.  Any segments of the RFI response that are marked proprietary will NOT be made available to the public or other private firms.

This RFI serves several purposes: 1) to inform the government about potential approaches for information retrieval and sharing; 2) to inform the government on the type and scope of work expected; and 3) to receive information and feedback on interest and capabilities of potential sources.  We request that respondents replying to this RFI provide a response to each question listed in Section 4.

2.	Background

The Federal Government is the largest single producer, collector, consumer, and disseminator of information in the United States.  

Government information is a valuable national resource and the free flow of information between the government and the public is essential to a democratic society.  It provides the public with knowledge of the government, society, and economy    past, present, and future.  It is a means to ensure the accountability of government, to manage the government's operations, to maintain the healthy performance of the economy, and is itself a commodity in the marketplace. 

It is also essential for the government to minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the public, minimize the cost of its information activities, and maximize the usefulness of government information including effectively sharing it among agencies to improve mission performance.

Efficient and effective sharing of information is needed for virtually every business function in government and is especially apparent in the areas such as health and benefits programs and national/homeland security.  

Today, Federal agencies are making increasing investments in information technology products and services providing information search, retrieval, and sharing capabilities.  There are many different technical approaches for providing these capabilities including the use of sophisticated search technologies and adopting metadata tagging. 

The primary goal of this RFI is to evaluate various approaches and carefully consider factors such as cost, ease of implementation, interoperability, and sustainability of operations to identify ways to promote greater public access to and Federal agency sharing of information.
2.1.	Example Scenarios

To help provide the context necessary to elicit quality responses from respondents, this RFI provides seven scenarios describing various common information discovery, retrieval, aggregation, and sharing needs.  Respondents are encouraged to use the scenarios below to provide context and examples for their responses to the specific questions found in section 4 below, specifically sections 4.2 and 4.3.  In addition, respondents may develop their own scenarios to provide better context for their responses.  The following scenarios are included: 

1.	Researching Unexplained Illnesses among Defense Contractors
2.	Performing a Search for an Expert
3.	Performing Academic Research
4.	Conducting an Information Audit Trail
5.	Sharing Law Enforcement Information across Jurisdictional Boundaries
6.	Possible Forged Identity
7.	Citizen looking for all online government information regarding a unique topic

2.1.1	Researching Unexplained Illnesses among Defense Contractors Supporting U.S. Military Operations

A primary care physician is treating a patient suffering from an unexplained illness.  He learns this patient was a defense contractor, having supported U.S. military operations in various countries worldwide.  The physician suspects that his illness might be linked to his participation in these operations, but needs to perform detailed research in a fairly short period of time to confirm or deny that hypothesis.  Given the relatively small population sample involved, there is little research available in academic or commercial medical literature definitively addressing the patient’s symptoms.  Therefore, the physician needs to perform a fairly exhaustive search for government information on the topic of unexplained illnesses among U.S. military veterans, the hypothesis being that illnesses impacting veterans will also likely impact the contractors deployed with them.

The physician knows intuitively that the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) are two good potential sources of information on this topic.  What he does not know is that there are also government information holdings addressing this topic at other agencies, including National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as the legislative branch (the House, Senate, the Library of Congress, and the Government Accountability Office), and some state and local governments. Relevant information is also potentially available from non-government sources, such as commercial entities (e.g., insurance companies) and academic organizations (e.g., research universities). Relevant information exists in a wide variety of formats:  electronic documents (e.g., plain text, HTML, XML, Adobe PDF, and other formats), tabular data (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, etc.), multimedia (e.g. sound, video, etc.), and biometric (gene databases, etc.). Some of these information resources are “deep web” or “hidden web” assets, not easily accessible from typical Internet search engines.

When conducting his search, the physician needs to be able to aggregate, analyze, and manipulate the information relevant to the topic.  For example, he needs to correlate general symptoms with information found in his patient’s medical records.  These records are mostly hand-written forms that have been digitized.  He might also need to correlate data geospatially (i.e. compare his patient’s overseas travels with overlays showing disease patterns in various locales worldwide). Since time is of the essence, he needs to have the ability to analyze large data sets quickly and accurately.

Once he is completed with his research, the physician will probably want to publish a paper to share his findings with the medical community.  This scholarly paper will contain citations to electronic government records available on the Internet.  The physician will want to ensure that his citations will still be attainable at some arbitrary point in the future. Finally, the physician will want to be automatically notified if any new government or other information concerning unexplained military service-connected illnesses is published.

2.1.2	Performing a Search for an Expert

The government needs to rapidly set up a work group to study an urgent, complex, yet relatively obscure technical issue.  The government wants to identify personnel throughout the Federal Government (civil servants, military personnel, retirees, and contractors) who are true experts in this area, and for that reason does not want to rely solely on self-selection (volunteers) or manager selection.  Since the technical issue is relatively obscure, it is unlikely (but still possible) that the skills related to it have been captured in human resources (HR)/personnel management systems.  A more likely source of identifying experts in this field will be through an analysis of subject matter related work products or websites the individuals or their employing organizations have created or helped to create.  Many of these work products are published on agency public websites, but some are located on internal Federal Government information systems or elsewhere outside the government.  Some of these information resources are “deep web” or “hidden web” assets, not easily accessible from typical Internet search engines.  Depending on how many Federal experts are found, the government might also want to broaden the search to include experts from state/local/tribal governments and the private sector, especially academic and non-profit organizations.

2.1.3	Performing Academic Research

A student is preparing a class report on Poland’s involvement in the Cold War including the extent to which the Poles, their leaders, and security services, were reluctant or willing participants with the Soviet Union. In addition, the student seeks to discover the significant impact that Pope John Paul and Lech Walesa had in contributing to the end of the Cold War.   As a part of his research for this report, he wants to locate and quickly analyze all government and other information resources covering this topic.  As a part of this analysis, he wants to be able to:

1.	Identify all government and other resources related to the Cold War pertaining specifically to Poland, with a preference for primary sources (e.g., reports, photos, maps, military unit histories, etc.) over secondary sources (e.g., textbooks, encyclopedias, etc.).
2.	Sort through all available information and retrieve those information resources most pertinent to his specific area of interest. 
3.	Translate any multi-lingual content into English.
4.	Derive an outline (taxonomy) describing the Poland’s involvement in the Cold War at a high level through an analysis of these resources.
5.	Extract relevant facts, summaries, and text passages from these resources – including some facts about Poland’s involvement in the Cold War that have not been widely reported and therefore providing a unique and valuable insight into this important period of history.
6.	Download maps of various Cold War hotspots, and add overlays to these maps to provide additional description and clarity.
7.	Organize everything using the outline created in step 2 above.
8.	Publish this information as both a paper and a website.


2.1.4	Conducting an Information Audit Trail

An individual or organization (e.g., policy official, land developer, commercial entity, etc.) must identify and track the flow of electronic information on a specific topic between government agencies to understand how and where that information was processed.  This individual also wants to identify the extent to which the information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.  This requirement may be driven by a routine or non-routine process such as an application filing, environmental findings, historical research, or a need to find more authoritative sources on this information.  

2.1.5	Sharing Law Enforcement Information across Jurisdictional Boundaries

A small local police department raids an apartment on a tip from a citizen alleging drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  A search of the apartment reveals documents containing handwritten notes in a foreign language, as well as a ledger documenting what appear to be financial transactions.  The investigators are able to lift numerous usable fingerprints from the apartment. Moreover, the walls of the apartment are decorated with fresh graffiti (they are unfamiliar with gang tagging and thus unequipped to decipher it).

The investigating officer processing the crime scene collects and inventories the documents and fingerprints, takes photos of the graffiti, and then submits these materials to the desk sergeant at the precinct, who digitizes everything and posts the materials to the appropriate regional law enforcement information sharing exchange. 

An investigator in a large municipality receives a notification that these documents, fingerprints, and photos have been posted to the regional information exchange.   The investigator translates/interprets the documents and photos, analyzes the materials, and correlates the information with other relevant information obtained from various law enforcement organizations at the Federal, state, local, and tribal levels. The investigator’s analysis reveals the local investigation is related to broader national-level gang related activities being investigated at the Federal level.

2.1.6	Possible Forged Identity

A credit card company has discovered a series of accounts that were fraudulently established on behalf of a group of unaware individual victims.  The credit card company notifies these victims who in turn must notify all pertinent organizations with which they have a financial relationship and governmental agencies they currently or potentially receive services from including Federal agencies.  

2.1.7	Citizen looking for all online government information regarding a unique topic

A citizen is searching for all available Federal Government information about a particular topic including information located on government websites.  A successful search will help her avoid using the complex, lengthy, and potentially costly Freedom of Information Act process.  There is no way to know in advance what any single individual citizen may be interested in but invariably the same, similar, or related government information is located at more than one Federal agency and comes in various types of online information.  Some of these information resources are “deep web” or “hidden web” assets, not easily accessible from typical Internet search engines.

 
3.	RFI Questionnaire
3.1.	General Approach

<DESC>NAVFAC requires the continued administration of the 360-Degree Feedback program in support of the FY-06 NAVFAC Leadership Development Initiative.

The 360-Degree Feedback program is administered to future leadership personnel who are in training.  It is designed to assist them in acquiring and maintaining superior leadership and directing skills, as well as improvement of interpersonal communications and relationships with superiors, peers and subordinates.

The required tasks are:  Administer the initial candidate survey for 100 LDI candidates.  This involves loading candidate names into a web-accessible database.  The candidates will enter names of individuals he/she will use as references.  The candidate then assesses himself/herself against a customized leadership skill survey, which inventories current skills and abilities.  The survey is tailored to the business lines present in NAVFAC and takes into account unique facets of this organization.  Candidate’s references fill out a separate web-based form evaluating the candidate in the areas requested.  Contractor collates and evaluates information received from candidates and their references, resulting in a baseline profile; the candidate uses this information as a baseline to meliorate knowledge and skills.  The Contractor performs feedback sessions, traveling to six regional NAVFAC locations to meet with LDI candidate groups to discuss survey results.  During these trips the Contractor also performs one-on-one sessions with candidates where necessary.  The Contactor will perform two Video Teleconference (VTC) sessions for candidates located in overseas and remote locations.  Contractor will use NAVFACHQ VTC facilities for these functions.  The Contractor provides continuous feedback to the NAVFAC LDI coordinator as to status of surveys, feedback sessions and candidate progress.

QUALIFICATIONS:  The contractor must be a certified professional, qualified to administer, evaluate and provide feedback for the 360-Degree Assessment.  The contractor must possess a comprehensive working knowledge of and experience specific to the significant features and functionality of  NAVFAC, Department of Navy, and the United States Government.

The period of performance is one-year.  

Qualified contractors shall submit expressions of interest by 5PM 29 September 2005.

From:		COMSC N1023

Subject:	AOE 6 Class Reduction Gear Replacement

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT AN OFFER.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY ANY COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION OF ANY SUBMISSION TO THIS MARKET SURVEY, OR TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES.

Introduction:

The purpose of this preliminary survey is to describe Military Sealift Command’s (MSC) AOE 6 Class reduction gear replacement program requirements and determine industry interest and receive comment from the gear community that will enhance the final technical requirements.  MSC wants to purchase four shipsets of gear components, plus spares, in the 2006-2007 timeframe.  The gears would then be stored at a warehouse facility for 2 to 3 years, at which time we would require installation oversight from the gear manufacturer for each of the four ship installations.  MSC would also require a minimum one-year warrantee period on all manufactured parts from the time of successful sea trial.  This survey in no way commits the government to the purchase of any products or services from responding vendors.  The information contained in the final request for proposals may differ from this initial description.

Additional information and drawings can be obtained at http://www.msc.navy.mil, under Contracts, then Active Request for Information (RFI)/Market Surveys.

<DESC>Subject: Historical Housing-Related Data


The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) has a requirement to secure specific types of housing-related electronic data.  The information will be used for basic research into historical price trends and for the analysis of mortgage delinquency and default phenomena.  The data sought include historical sale prices, property characteristics, mortgage information and foreclosure histories for single family residences in California, Illinois and Florida.  The information may be provided in multiple electronic tables (e.g., a mortgage history table, a mortgage recordation table, etc.), but a unique property identifier will be provided in each to facilitate the appropriate linking of information across the data sources.  The following delineates other minimum requirements for the data to be provided. 

For the majority of counties in California, Illinois and Florida, the historical sales information will report the following information in connection with property sales: a unique property identifier, the transfer price, the transfer date, flags for partial and non arms-length sales, property address, mailing address for the purchaser (containing at least the city, state, and zip code), the total assessed property value (land plus structure), the land assessment value, the improvements assessment, the annual property taxes paid, the year of construction, the lot size, the home square footage (heated or air conditioned area), the type of heating, the type of cooling, the number of fireplaces, the number of bathrooms, the number of bedrooms, an indicator for whether a pool is present, the census tract number, and the census block group.  For Illinois and Florida, transaction data must begin in 1998, if not earlier.  For California, transaction data must extend back to at least 1989.  Inclusive of transactions in all three states, the dataset will contain at least ten million property transactions.  

For the majority of the counties in California, Illinois and Florida, the mortgage data will show recording dates and lien amounts.  Lien recording information must be available in California beginning in at least 1989.  For Illinois and Florida, the data period must start in 1998, if not earlier.   In addition to recording dates and lien amounts, the data will include property address information.  For more than half of the counties in California, information will be provided on: noteholder name, notice of default dates, default amounts, opening bid amounts for trustee sales, REO recording dates and REO transfer values.

The contractor will also have available for purchase a dataset that, when used in conjunction with the historical transactions data, allows the user to identify houses that have undergone significant qualitative improvements.  The data will allow the user to compare house characteristics at different points in time and identify those characteristics that have changed (e.g., an increase in the number of bathrooms).  The contractor must have the capability of providing these data within thirty days of request.

All of the data provided to OFHEO must be of high quality and extracted from source records in a reliable way.  Dependable, prompt, and knowledgeable support must be provided so that questions concerning field definitions and data anomalies can be resolved in a timely and reliable fashion.  Prior to acquisition of any data, the candidate vendor also must be willing to provide prompt and detailed information concerning coverage levels, field definitions, and—if applicable—any apparent data anomalies provided as part of the review process.  The vendor must not require upfront payment prior to the provision of the data. 

It is OFHEO’s intention to negotiate this requirement on a basis of other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1).  The proposed source is DataQuick, 9620 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1963.  DataQuick is the only source identified to perform this effort for the following reasons: the comprehensiveness and depth of its coverage, the breadth of information collected, its timeliness, and its servicing capabilities.  Organizations that determine they meet the specific requirements must furnish detailed information concerning their capabilities.  This is not a request for proposal nor a promise to contract.  OFHEO will not pay any costs associated with the preparation and submission of organizational data.  Responses must be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice.  No solicitation exists.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No additional synopsis will be published.  Any RFP will be issued to all qualified firms that respond to this synopsis of intent.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Nancy Kennamer, Contract Specialist, Ph:null, Fx:(512) 326-6028
<DESC>The Department of VA Austin Automation Center (AAC) is in a transitional period of expanding its disaster recovery (DR) operations to accommodate additional customer applications at its Hines, Illinois facility.  This transition period is estimated not to exceed one year.  The AAC is interested in identifying sources that can provide an expeditious means of providing DR support for customer applications in the event of a disaster. To this end, we are interested in determining an accelerated process for the purchase, lease, or rental of replacement hardware with expedited shipping to the Hines, Illinois DR location.  An example list of equipment is included below. An on-site hardware maintenance contract with 24x7x4 hour response for the duration of the lease, rental, or up to one year period for purchased equipment is required.  To have 100% of the attached list of equipment in place at the Hines facility within XXX hours of a declared disaster. (Please specify) To accomplish this DR operation in the most cost effective manner with innovative approaches and capitalizing on industry best practices.  A short-term rental or lease of this equipment is preferred over outright purchase. Regardless of the proposed acquisition method, rental, lease, or purchase, all hard disk media will be retained by the government at the close of the contract.  Likewise, all maintenance services provided under this contract shall incorporate provisions for government retention of hard disk drives.

S pecifically, the Army is seeking sources having either previously developed and fully tested dual technology (metal detection and ground penetrating radar) handheld mine detector, or having the capability to design, develop, integrate and test a new dual t echnology mine detector and having demonstrated cost reductions in corollary detectors over the last year. The mine detectors shall be designed to meet or exceed the performance specifications listed below.  Specifically, the detectors must: 1)  detect 96%  of targets (or higher), with a false alarm rate of no more than 3 false alarms per 5 square meters, where such performance is against landmines of all types (constructed of metal, plastic, and wood), under all types of weather conditions, and in all types  of terrain; 2) detect targets on the surface and up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) below the surface; 3) weigh no more than 11 pounds; 4) provide near real-time (less than or equal to 1/30th second) mine detection audio and/or visual alerts; 5) have at leas t two sensors (metal detection and ground penetrating radar), with each of the sensors continuously operating with audio outputs capable  of being selected in combination or separately as determined by the operator; 6) have an independent power source (e.g . battery power) and provide an operational time of greater than or equal to two hours without battery change; 7) include a Built-in-Test (BIT) capability to provide clear indication of sub-system and system-level faults; 8) be capable of being operated, m aintained, and repaired with a minimal training; 9) include an Aided Target Recognition (AiTR) Detection Algorithm with a flexibility that can be programmed, reprogrammed and selectable to address specific mine targets and a specific region of humanitarian  demining operations. Additionally, the AiTR shall operate in a region processing manner with a mine/no-mine confirmation after the device has been scanned over a small investigated area; and 10) operator visual displays must provide sufficient contrast be tween all displayed information and the display background to ensure that information is visible under all lighting conditions.  In addition, the metal detection component shall be Continuous Wave Metal Detection (CWMD) and the ground penetrating radar com ponent shall be a stepped frequency design with a minimum of 1.4 GHz bandwidth in the 1 to 3 GHz frequency range.  The Government is looking for a detector with an initial unit cost of $12,000 of less for limited quantities and $8,000 or less for quantitie s of 500 or more.  Sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy these detector requirements through commercial or Non-Developmental Items (NDI) systems or commercial or NDI system components are invited to submit a ten (10) page White Paper providing a d escription of their system.  The White Paper shall include, as a minimum:  1) A description of the system and validating information supporting claims that the proposed system meets the system performance specification; 2) Test Report data to include verif ied probability of detection (Pd) and False Alarm Rate (FAR) from an official U.S. Government Test and Evaluation agency (not included in the page count); 3) Product literature; 4) Past performance information; and 5) Price schedules/catalogues (not includ ed in the page count). Respondents must also include information regarding 1) customary practices (including warranties, discounts, etc.), and under which comme rcial sales of the products are made, and 2) requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the item being acquired.

<SUBJECT>A -- GPO Future Digital System (FDsys) Oppurtunity
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only!

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is currently establishing a digital content system (FDsys) to allow government content to be created, managed, authenticated, versioned and subsequently preserved in perpetuity. 
The proposed FDsys will ingest, preserve, and provide access to the information produced by all three branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. The system will enable GPO customers to obtain hard copy publications and to electronically access the content they want, and it will enable GPO to deliver that content in the formats its customers desire. The system should automate many of the content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. The proposed system is required to support not only GPO’s current operational policies but also any changes that may emerge. 

GPO is requesting industry assessment of our documentation as well as information to determine the capabilities of vendors to provide some or all of the services required for the FDsys, including master integration and individual solution sets.  This information will be used to revise, if necessary, our Requirements and Concept documentation, Implementation plan and Acquisition strategy in order to deliver a world-class information lifecycle management system beginning in mid 2006.
Opportunity:
GPO is engaging in a two (2) phase process for development of the FDsys. Phase one (1) is to contract for a Master Integrator (MI). This phase will also include the identification and concept selection of the necessary solution sets required to deliver the FDsys. NOTE: The MI may be responsible for obtaining or purchasing on behalf of GPO the solutions sets. However, GPO will have ultimate authority for accepting and defining the methodology for selecting the technology components. Phase two (2) is the actual integration of the solution sets into a release based system by the MI.

It is anticipated that the MI contract will be based on GPO’s release schedule with initial award for a potential three year period which would culminate in the successful completion of FDsys release 1 (which includes 1A, 1B, and 1C). The MI will work collaboratively with the FDsys Program Management Office and GPO’s Office of the Chief Technical Officer to perform concept selection and reliability and robustness testing of the solution sets and clusters as identified by GPO. These selections will be based on the implementation plan and release schedule also identified by GPO. Once the selection of technology is accomplished, the MI will be responsible for integrating those solution sets into the subsequent working releases of FDsys. The ultimate objective for the MI will be to integrate and deliver a fully functional system to meet the requirements as defined in the FDsys documentation.

Informational Meeting (Industry Day):
On 6 October 2005 from 8:30 AM until 12:30 PM (prior to the release of any formal request for proposal), GPO will be conducting an informational meeting (Industry Day) at its headquarters in Washington, DC.  The meeting is open to any interested vendor who has products or services that are in direct support of the requirements identified for the FDsys. Space for the event is limited to 300 people and pre-registration is required. Vendors are allowed no more than two (2) representatives total for an entire company and GPO reserves the right to reduce that number to one (1) in order to mitigate overcrowding. Individual divisions or groups of a single company are considered a single parent company. It is strongly recommended that at least one (1) of the participants be from one of the vendor’s technical division(s).

All wishing to participate in Industry Day must pre-register by providing the names of attendees and indication of interest via email to int@gpo.gov (subject heading “FDsys Industry Day Pre-registration”) no later than 12:00 (noon) eastern time on 29 September 2005. The session will be open to only those vendors who have pre-registered. NOTE: Accessibility for persons with a disability is provided, but must be noted in the pre-registration email. Please include the type of accommodation required in the email. Industry day will include individual break out sessions. Due to logistics and space concerns, each attendee must select and identify in the registration email, no more than two (2) breakout sessions they would like to attend from the following list:

MARKET VALUE:	

The market value for this PSC is equivalent to a GS-14 level.  The salary range for a GS-14 level is $76,193 - $99,053. In addition, the Mission has 20% Danger Pay. The salary will be determined based on the individual’s salary history, working experience and educational background of the successful candidate.

BACKGROUND:  

The last four years of conflict and closures have resulted in significant decline in exports, investment, production, and employment. Current restrictions on movement of people and goods continue to cripple the economy by increasing transaction costs tenfold. These restrictions negatively impact the productive capacity of Palestinian producers and their capacity to increase income and employment.  In addition, the Palestinian Authority continues to be administratively, managerially, and technically weak in the areas of financial and economic management of the economy.  USAID is working to improve this situation.

The United States Agency for International Development for West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) is contracting for several technical assistance projects to increase Palestinian trade both with Israel and the rest of the world, as well as to improve the economic management capability of the Palestinian Authority.

This consultancy is located in the Private Enterprise Office (PEO), Strategic Objective No.1 (SO1), USAID/West Bank and Gaza, Tel Aviv. The primary purpose of this position is to advise and assist the PEO Director on economic strategic planning, program development and implementation.

4)	Draft and review scopes of work for consultants, work plans, budgets, procurement plans, and other pertinent documentation required for design, development and implementation of economic management and private sector development activities and develop monitoring and evaluation systems to determine effectiveness of implementation.

5)	Based on experience with highly complex and policy development projects in a politically charged environment, review assessments of accomplishments of targets and indicators and assure that appropriate methodologies are employed.  Review continuing appropriateness of indicators and suggest modifications where appropriate.  Fully document and verify that records are maintained to guide future decision making.

6)	As a recognized technical area expert on economic development issues, prepare scopes of work and related material for upcoming procurements and procurement amendments and secure consensus at the highest possible level in the Palestinian Authority (PA).

This is a amendment to solicitation FA4877-05-Q-QU015 which was posted on 6 Sep 2005.  A list is provided of Q/A's that were posed by various contractors.  The answers are from our Technical Representative.  Hopefully, this will answer any questions you may have had of your own.  Thank you.

Q – Are the control system processors (Crestron or AMX) already in place?. They are not spelled out in your bill of materials.

A - Processors are in place, however, since it is a modular system, it may need additional modules to support the upgrade

Q - Do you own the programming code for the control systems? If not, the prevailing bidder will have to rewrite the code.

A - No, the code would have to be re-written

Q - All the equipment is easy to get however it is not entirely obvious how you want the equipment configured. 5 projectors and 5 screens are easy enough to figure out but 28 speakers and the amount of touchpanel interfaces do not divide into the rooms evenly. Please clarify.

A - (Upon request from Curtis.Alexander@dm.af.mil) For a visual, there is a slideshow that shows more or less where we want everything.  The list of equipment does not cover things to nuts and bolts level like the bid does, so it is to be used as a simple visual aide only.  If you want more details, my opinion is that they need to come out and do a site survey.


Q - Is the site visit mandatory?

A - No, the site visit is not mandatory, but highly encouraged.

Q - For Line Item (1) Distributed Ceiling Speakers, Qty: 28 each.  In how many rooms are these speakers going to be installed, and how many speakers in each room are desired?  What are the dimensions (width, length, height from floor to ceiling) of the rooms?  Speakers usually are ordered in pairs.  Just to make sure: Is the requirement for 14 pairs of speakers, for a total of 28 units?   

A - Upon request from Curtis.Alexander@dm.af.mil) For a visual, there is a slideshow that shows more or less where we want everything.  The list of equipment does not cover things to nuts and bolts level like the bid does, so it is to be used as a simple visual aide only.  If you want more details, my opinion is that they need to come out and do a site survey.

Q - For Line Item (4) Electric 8ft. Diameter Video Screen, Qty: 4 each.  Would a screen measuring as closely as possible to 8’ on the diagonal be acceptable?  By “Electric”, is it meant that the screen would not be permanently fixed in place, but instead could be electrically lowered and raised?  Will this screen be mounted on a wall, on the ceiling, or in an above-ceiling mount?  For Line Item (5) Electric 12ft. Diameter Video Screen, Qty: 1 each. 
Would a screen measuring as closely as possible to 12’ on the diagonal be acceptable?  By “Electric”, is it meant that the screen would not be permanently fixed in place, but instead could be electrically lowered and raised?  Will this screen be mounted on a wall, on the ceiling, or in an above-ceiling mount?

A - Screens need to be ceiling mounted and be the same size as the others in place.  Not sure if an 8ft/12ft screen is exactly that size, but they need to be the same size as existing which are sold as 8ft/12ft.

Q - For Line Item (6) Projector Mounting Hardware, Qty: 5 each.  (ceiling mount; drop ceiling less than 3’) Can a 2x2 grid mount be used? Would the Chief CMA-450 2X2 Grid Mount (specification attached), be acceptable? 

A - Not an expert on fastening items to our facility structures.  I believe that there is at least 3ft clearance above the ceiling tiles though.
 
Q - For Line Item (9) Distributed Audio Volume Control, Qty: 2 each.  Are these units intended to control the output volume from the ceiling speakers (Line Item 1)? (If this is correct, and only two such controllers are required, does that mean the answer to the number of rooms in question 1, above, is “Two rooms”?) If these controllers are not intended to control output volume from the ceiling speakers, please explain what devices these units are intended to control.  What is the number of attached devices these units are intended to control?

A - The Audio controllers will be controlling speakers at the bar and the patio.  The wall units will take care of the audio in the other locations. 

Q - For Line Item (11) Color Touch screen Room Control, Qty: 5 each. The price of these screens varies widely depending on their size, and how they are mounted.  Attached are specifications for several representative units.  What size touch screen is desired?  Shall the touch screen be mounted on a wall, a desk, or podium?  Shall the unit be wireless or wired?

A - Touch screens are wired to the wall.  Wiring is provided already.  Need to match existing touch screens which are the CT-1000s.
 
Q - For Line Item (14) DVD/VCR, Qty: 3 each. Will these be used for recording A/V sources?

A - The DVD/VCRs will be used for sending video to any of the projectors.
 
Q - For Line Item (15) UHF Wireless Microphone System, Qty: 6.    Shall this microphone be a Hand-held mic, or one that’s clipped to the lapel of the presenter? 

A - Half and Half.

Q - Are the equipment locations class room settings or board room settings?

A - Upon request from Curtis.Alexander@dm.af.mil) For a visual, there is a slideshow that shows more or less where we want everything.  The list of equipment does not cover things to nuts and bolts level like the bid does, so it is to be used as a simple visual aide only.  If you want more details, my opinion is that they need to come out and do a site survey.

Q - What size ceiling speakers are you looking for 6" or 8"? 

A - Neither, JBLs are a 6.5" speaker.

Q - Do you want the speaker cones to be aimable?

A - Yes.

Q - Are the ceiling speakers needed 70vts.

A - Yes.

Q - Do they reside in one location or multiple?

A - Multiple.

Q - On the A/V plates are you looking for s-vid or composite vid? 

A - C-vid

Q - (Same plate) are you looking for audio to accompany the VGA input?

A - Yes

Q - (Same plate) how many network connections are needed?

A - One

Q - How are the plates to be mounted exterior or inset on the wall?
A - Flush

Q - For the projectors and screens does the rooms have a drop ceiling and if so what is the measurements from the lid to the ceiling tiles?

A - Dropped ceiling.  Not sure what the "lid" is, but there is anywhere from 3-5' clearance above the tiles

Q - How many VGA and video inputs are needed for the projectors?

A - Not sure how to answer this one.  I want to control the projector from the wall plate or from the central control system.  If they are asking about the projector itself, the XGA 3000 has 2 VGA inputs.

Q - What format and screen tension are the ones existing on site and are the new ones required to match them?

A - Don't know, as long as they are 8' or 12' and drop down electronically from the ceiling from the touchscreen controller.

Q - The out door speakers, wall mounted, ceiling mounted or a rock looking?

A - Yes

Q - Is the control system AMX or Crestron?

A - Crestron.  BTW, we need to ensure that whoever gets the contract is using a certified Crestron programmer.
 
Q - Are existing systems sharing a system controlled processor? (AMX or Crestron) 

A - Yes.

Q - Are the new systems to mimic the existing systems?

A - Yes, they need to be fully integrated into the existing system and match visually.
          
Q - Do you have the existing programs available to use as a template if the above is required?

A -  No, not gov't owned.

Q - Are the DVD/VCR units combo items?

A - Yes

Q - The wireless mics body packs, hand held or both?

A - Both, half and half

Q - The above A/V plate called for a mic input are you supplying the hard wired mics?

A - Yes

Q - What kind of racks are requested: ERK OR WRK with casters, wall mounted or pullout?

A - Not sure of the exact type, but they will be bolt mounted to the floor and open 

Q - Do the racks need front doors

A - No

Q - Are the rooms where the racks reside air conditioned?

A -  Yes
      
Q - Do any of these rooms tie into each other for over flow?

A - Yes on both, see slideshow for a visual

Q - Is there any switchers needed in the system?

A - Not real sure what switchers are, just need to be able to pipe A/V to all some or one projector/room.

To be considered nationally certified, an interpreter must complete and pass RID's written and performance tests.

VI. BILLING POLICY AND POC

VIII GOVERNMENT FACILITY ENTRANCE:   

All contractor personnel or any representative of the contractor entering any government facility or government leased facility shall abide by all security regulations and be subject to security checks.  Access to a DFAS site must be coordinated with the local point of contact to ensure that any site-specific requirements are met.

Security and Privacy Act Requirements: All work-performed relative to the tasking identified in the SOW are unclassified or carry a Privacy Act Classification.  System security shall be in accordance with DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for AIS.

Security Investigation Requirements: No classified work will be required.  However, the contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category ADP/AIS II.  Contractor must ensure sensitive (privacy act) information is properly safeguarded at the work site and not removed from the work site.  Also, the contractor will be required to comply with the security requirements associated with access to the DFAS enterprise network.  This requires individuals who perform duties at the ADP/AIS II category to have a favorable determination of requisite investigation IAW the specifications of the DoD Personnel Security Program as provided for in the DoD 5200.2-R.  If declared, the contractor may be requested to undergo a higher level of investigation.  The Government will not incur the investigation expenses caused by contractor employee turnover or replacement within a year’s time.  The National Agency Check (NAC) includes the following:

&#61623; Standard Form 85P - Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
&#61623; FD 258 - Finger Print Card

All contractor personnel requiring access to the DFAS systems will complete a National Agency Check (NAC).  The SF 85P will be completed using the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ).  EPSQs are available for downloading on the Defense Security Service (DSS) Web Site at www.dss.mil\epsq.  Completed EPSQs, to include a copy on a disk and a signed hard copy, will be provided to the Contract Officer’s Representative (COR) or Government Point of Contact (GPOC) elsewhere named in this award.  All 85Ps must be accompanied with a copy of the contractor’s birth certificate for citizenship verification.  Foreign Nationals must submit appropriate documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Employment of non-US citizens requires a fully completed and favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to beginning DFAS work. The COR/GPOC will notify the contractor when contractor employees have been approved for access to the facility.  The NACs should be completed before the contractor employee begins work. However, on an exception basis and if an emergency situation exists, a US citizen contractor employee may begin once the NAC has been reviewed, initiated, and there is no derogatory information and the COR/GPOC obtains contractor badges.  Those US citizen contractors needed to begin work prior to receipt of a favorable NAC must have a waiver of pre-appointment investigative requirements approved by the proponent Business Line Executive, Client Executive, or Corporate Director.    All contractor employees must receive a favorable NAC.  Unfavorable NAC findings will require individual determinations by the cognizant DFAS security office prior to allowing contractor employee access to the facility.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Senior Development Advisor (SDA) to SOCOM will serve as a key USAID lead in developing coordinated programs, systems, and coordination mechanisms in critical regions and program functions for the US national security interest.  

B.	BACKGROUND

The USAID Office of Military Affairs (OMA) was created as of March 2005.  It is housed within the USAID Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA Bureau, also home to the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), Food for Peace (FFP), Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Democracy and Governance (DG) Offices), but its responsibilities are Agency-wide.  Its objective is to help USAID and the military define, evaluate and develop programs and coordination mechanisms that address areas of common interest between the U.S. defense and development communities, including but not limited to the U.S. National Security Strategy.  

To accomplish this objective, the following tasks will be undertaken:

1.  Evaluate and develop joint and parallel planning and programs focused on regional and field missions supported through USAID regional bureaus and DOD combatant commands (COCOMs).  

2.  Develop mutually acceptable guidance, policy and doctrine as needed for effective program development and coordination.  

3.  Implement training, education and operational programs designed to build understanding and operational efficiency between the two organizations.

Program areas of common interest include, but may not be limited to, humanitarian assistance, the global war on terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, and transformational development.  

The office will serve as the Agency-wide unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship.  This responsibility includes program planning and implementation needed for effective operations involving USAID and the military, and the development of operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The office will consist of two divisions, one for planning and one for operations.  The functions of the planning division  is to serve as the overall coordination unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship, and for planning, program development/management needed for effective future joint and parallel operations involving USAID and the military (U.S. and others).  The operations division will serve as the lead unit to develop operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The locus of informed and enhanced field operations within the US military resides in the combatant commands, both regional and functional.  The key regional commands of specific interest to USAID are as follows:

CENTCOM, or Central Command.  Located at McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, CENTCOM is responsible for field operations throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.  This command covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Central Asia, making it the most important and active command at this point in time.

EUCOM, or the European Command.  Located in Stuttgart, Germany, EUCOM is responsible for North, West and Southern Africa, the Caucuses, Europe and Russia.  Africa is now its most strategically important territory.  

PACOM, or the Pacific Command.  Located at Camp Smith in Honolulu, HI, PACOM is responsible for Asia and the Pacific up to the border of Pakistan.  While northern Asia (China, Japan and Korea) are key areas of focus, Southeast and South Asia are increasingly important in the Global War on Terror.  Indonesia and the Philippines are of particular importance.  

SOUTHCOM, or the Southern Command.  Located in Miami, FL, SOUTHCOM is responsible for South and Central America.  Although natural disaster and counter-narcotics responses have been the major focus of civ-mil operations in the recent past, there is a growing list of countries of concern and joint interest on the development front in the region.  

SOCOM, or the Special Operations Command.  Located in McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, SOCOM oversees Special Forces of all services, Civil Affairs, and Psyops.  SOCOM is considered the lead command for the Global War on Terror.  Civil Affairs is a key interlocutor with USAID in most countries on humanitarian and development assistance, and will likely look to a more collaborative relationship with USAID under emerging stability operations programs under DOD.  SOCOM officially requested an advisor during a recent visit of Gen. Dailey to the USAID Administrator.  SOCOM’s role in Stability Operations, Civil Affairs and the Global War on Terror all involve a substantial intersect with USAID’s development agenda.  

C. 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) will serve as USAID’s senior development advisor to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  The overall objective is to strengthen both DOD and USAID planning and operations in SOCOM through improved coordination and joint action between the two organizations.  The PSC will serve for a period of two years, with option to extend an additional two years based on mutual agreement.  The PSC will be stationed at SOCOM in MacDill Air Force Base, and will work within the SOCOM Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG).  

The PSC will report to the Senior Military Advisor in the Office of Military Affairs (DCHA/OMA) in USAID/Washington, and will be supported and assisted by the relevant bureau representatives through the Office of Military Affairs Working Group.   

For day-to-day cooperation and guidance, the PSC will report to and come under the support, an appointed senior representative of the Director of the SOCOM JIACG.  The Director/JIACG will ensure the provision of support services for the PSC.  The Director, JIACG will provide access and interface to units and officers deemed essential to build a strong working relationship between USAID and SOCOM.  The PSC will also coordinate closely with the State Department Political Advisor (the POLAD) in SOCOM, providing information and input that would help State operations and ensure a close working relationship with the Ambassadors in the respective regions.  

The PSC tasks shall include, but not be limited to:

1.  Coordinate the evaluation, review and development of SOCOM and USAID assistance programs and plans deemed of mutual interest and objectives within the SOCOM area of operations.  This would include Theater Security Cooperation Plans, Information Operations Plans, emerging Stability Operations proposals, and USAID mission annual and sectoral planning documentation, among others as appropriate.  The Security Cooperation Plans represent DOD’s annual planning and budget document for most non-warfare programs.  The PSC will link together USAID’s regional bureau headquarters and their field missions with the SOCOM planning groups so that programs and budgets are developed that reinforce and support joint objectives and approaches in the region.  (25%)

2.  The PSC will lead or facilitate the evaluation and development of USAID assistance programs of mutual interest that may lie outside of the Theater Security Cooperation Plan.

Contacts in the US military will be guided by SOCOM, and should include relevant US and overseas training, pre-deployment and support units; key policy and support groups and leaders in the Pentagon, with point persons in Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); and other COCOMs including their USAID liaison officers.  The PSC will also develop relationships with other key donors and partners working in the region, including NATO, UN organizations, and other country militaries as recommended by SOCOM and OMA.  (20%)

6.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Senior Development Advisor (SDA) to the European Command (EUCOM) will serve as a key USAID lead in developing coordinated programs, systems, and coordination mechanisms in critical regions and program functions for the US national security interest.  

B.	BACKGROUND

The USAID Office of Military Affairs (OMA) was created as of March 2005.  It is housed within the USAID Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA Bureau, also home to the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), Food for Peace (FFP), Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Democracy and Governance (DG) Offices), but its responsibilities are Agency-wide.  Its objective is to help USAID and the military define, evaluate and develop programs and coordination mechanisms that address areas of common interest between the U.S. defense and development communities, including but not limited to the U.S. National Security Strategy.  

To accomplish this objective, the following tasks will be undertaken:

1.  Evaluate and develop joint and parallel planning and programs focused on regional and field missions supported through USAID regional bureaus and Department of Defense (DOD) combatant commands (COCOMs).  

2.  Develop mutually acceptable guidance, policy and doctrine as needed for effective program development and coordination.  

3.  Implement training, education and operational programs designed to build understanding and operational efficiency between the two organizations.

Program areas of common interest include, but may not be limited to, humanitarian assistance, the global war on terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, and transformational development.  

The office will serve as the Agency-wide unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship.  This responsibility includes program planning and implementation needed for effective operations involving USAID and the military, and the development of operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The office will consist of two divisions, one for planning and one for operations.  The functions of the planning division  is to manage the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship, and to plan and develop programs and coordination structures for effective future joint and parallel operations involving USAID and the military (U.S. and others).  The development advisor (the PSC) position is in the Planning Division of OMA.  This is one of five development advisor positions that USAID intends to place at selected regional and functional commands.  These commands form the core of US military joint leadership of field operations within respective geographic and functional specialties.  The priority initial combatant commands include EUCOM, Central Command (CENTCOM), Pacific Command (PACOM), Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  

The establishment of positions within combatant commands has been vetted with the Pentagon, and the specific agreement with respect to a position in EUCOM was reached in principle during a visit of USAID Assistant Administrators Dr. Edward Menarchik (USAID Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (AA/PPC)) and Mr. Michael Hess (USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (AA/DCHA)) with the EUCOM Deputy Combatant Commander General Wald.  EUCOM’s primary traditional role has involved the former Soviet Union and NATO.  Since 9/11, however, Africa has taken on more importance given the potential for failed states and ungoverned territories there.  Evolving US military priorities all point to increasing attention to pre and post conflict, fragile and failed states stability operations and counterterrorism.  Eastern Europe and the Caucuses, as well as continued interest in Russia, are also continuing priorities, and areas where USAID has large program interests.  Development objectives are a key component of the US national security agenda, and are becoming more prominent within US military objectives.  

C. 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) will serve as USAID’s development advisor to the European Command (EUCOM).  The overall objective is to strengthen both DOD and USAID planning and operations in the EUCOM region through improved coordination and joint action between the two organizations.  The PSC will serve for a period of two years, with option to extend an additional two years based on mutual agreement.  The PSC will be stationed in Stuttgart, Germany, and will work in the Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG).  The JIACG resides within the Operations (J3) command, which is the unit responsible for operations in the EUCOM geographic region.  The PSC will report back to the senior military advisor, Office of Military Affairs (DCHA/OMA) in USAID/Washington.  OMA will be responsible for developing a strong working relationship with the three USAID regional bureaus in Washington that oversee the missions in the EUCOM theater, including Africa Bureau, Asia and Near East Bureau, and the Europe and Eurasia Bureau.    

For day-to-day guidance and support, the PSC will work with the JIACG Division Chief.  The JIACG Division Chief will be responsible for the provision of agreed upon support services for the PSC and will provide access and interface to units and officers within EUCOM deemed essential to build a strong working relationship between USAID and EUCOM throughout the region.  This relationship will be key since the direct relationship between USAID and the U.S. military is likely to be more robust than the interagency dialogue.  The PSC will also coordinate closely with the State Department Political Advisor (POLAD) at EUCOM.  

The PSC tasks shall include, but not be limited to:

1.  Coordinate the evaluation, review and development of EUCOM and USAID assistance programs and plans deemed of mutual interest and objectives within the EUCOM area of operations.  This would include Theater Security Cooperation Plans, Information Operations Plans, and USAID mission annual and sectoral planning documentation, among others as appropriate.  The Theater Security Cooperation Plans are the annual DOD program and budget documents for most humanitarian, civil-military and non-war-fighting components of regional operations.

5.

This will include assistance on the negotiation of effective working relationships in the field between the NGO community and the military.  USAID’s Washington units involved in the region include the Africa Bureau, especially the West Africa and Southern Africa regional desks, Africa/Development Planning and front office; the Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&E) Office of Eurasian Affairs, Office of Eastern European Affairs, the Program Office and the front Office; the Asia and Near East (ANE) Office of Middle East Affairs, the Office of Strategy and Program Operations, and the front office; the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian (DCHA) Bureau, including OMA, CMM, OFDA, OTI, DG and FFP; the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (PPC); and the relevant special assistant in the Administrator’s office.

Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 31 AUG 2006.  FOB Point Destination Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk, VA 23511 and Norfolk Naval Ship Yard, Norfolk VA 23502.  Contractor shall adhere to all requirements and regulations of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the USS Harry S. Truman and the Norfolk Naval Shipyard once established. 
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause), FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN 2004) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003)(a) Inspection/Acceptance:  Contractor shall expect a reasonable degree of pre-acceptance inspection by ship’s representative(s) to validate and confirm all final product conforms to the specifications described in this solicitation and in conjunction with what is considered industry standard on U.S. Navy vessels here in Norfolk, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (JAN 2004) within this clause, the following clauses apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.219-06 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003),   52.222-19 Child Labor—Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (JAN 2004)(E.O. 13126), 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (APR 2002) (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998) (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (OCT 2003) (E.O.S, proclamations, and statutes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of Treasury), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3322), FAR 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests (DEC 2003), FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (OCT 1997).

<DESC>The receipt date for submittal of your quotes is hereby extended to Wednesday, September 21, 2005 at 2:00 PM local time.  Assumptions to be made when pricing your quote:  All work will be done in phases to coincide with the construction contractor.  All movement and reconfiguration of furniture will be done between 4:30 PM and 6:00 AM, Monday through Friday or on weekends.  (This is the preferred work schedule.  Some work may be able to be accomplished from 6:00 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and will be discussed at a joint post award conference to be held with all contractors involved in the project.)    

It is anticipated that the initial phase of the movement will take place on or about October 6, 2005 but is subject to change.  Actual dates to be discussed during the post award conference.  

NRCS-Indianapolis may have sufficient equipment to enable the new configuration to be completed; however, some new pieces may need to be provided by the contractor since some panel pieces may not be the correct size.  (Any new pieces shall be similar in color and patterns already in place.  The furniture is a mixture of Steel Case and Haworth.) New furniture will be purchased for the receptionist area and furnished by the contractor.  

It behooves anyone who is going to submit a quote to perform a walk through prior to submittal of their quote to confirm quantities and sizes.   Contact Marla Sparks at (317) 290-3200 ext. 330 to arrange a walk through.  

Submit the following along with your quote:  (1) an itemized break down of your quote to include pricing for all additional pieces to be furnished by the contractor; (2) two optional proposals for new furniture for the receptionists (one for systems furniture along with several color and material options and one for wood furniture); and, (3) options for mail room cabinets to include under counter storage and mail bins.  Specifications should be discussed during your walk through.) All computer equipment and peripherals will be moved by NRCS staff.  It is anticipated that nearly 100% of furniture and equipment in the areas will be moved or reconfigured.  Some may need to be moved more than once to accommodate construction.  

All boxes needed for personal items will be provided by NRCS-Indianapolis.  The Product Service Code for this acquisition is K071, Movement of Furniture.  The NAICS code is changed to 442110 and size standard is $6,000,000.

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS FROM SITE SURVEY CONDUCTED SEPTEMBER 9, 2005
Q1: What is the make/model/part number for the JBL speakers? 
A1: JBL Control Contractor Ceiling Loudspeakers /24CT
Q2: Based on the number of  microphones and speakers, is the XAP 800 required, or can another mixer with less capability be used? 
A2: No, the XAP 800 is no longer required.  
Q3: What is the make/model number/part number for the Extron VGA Amp?
A3: Cross Point/ 88-IVA
Q4: What is the make/model/ part number of the ceiling mounted microphones?
A4: Ceiling mics are no longer a requirement.  (request two Polycom P/N 2201-09174-004)  Mics on Table will be sufficient.
Q5: Will this application work as ISDN or IP?  
A5: ISDN
Q6: Since the PolyCom ViewStation FX that was called out in the SOW is MDA, please confirm that a modern equivalent PolyCom is acceptable.
A6: Yes.  Modern equivalent Polycom is acceptable 
Q7: Is the requirement for a "PTZ camera with voice tracking" an absolute customer requirement or will a PTZ camera with built-in or even AMX programmable, multiple camera presets be acceptable?  
A7: Yes, a PTZ camera with built-in or even AMX programmable, multiple camera presets will be acceptable.
Q8: Can we substitute the Crestron control system with one from AMX. We assume that a wireless touch panel is preferred. These come in four different sizes... 5.5", 7.5", 8.5" or 10" the larger the size, the more space they take up and they cost more...does the customer have any preference on the size of the touch panel?  
A8: Yes, 7.5.
Q9: Does the customer intend to increase the capabilities (add more video or audio or PCs), in the immediate future? If not, we would recommend decreasing some of the spec's for some of the items. As long as our "substitution or elimination" retains the capabilities of the SOW, is this acceptable?  
A9:  Yes, there are possibilities for future requirements/expansion. In regards to your separate question, as long as your “substitution or elimination” retains the capabilities of the SOW, that is also acceptable.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ).

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The following industry questions and Government responses are provided as follows: Question 1:  The solicitation states that "Once developed and approved, courses shall be conducted ..."  Is there a standard guideline on how long
it takes to get a course approved by DHS?  Which entity will approve the course?  Is it possible to get a copy of approval guidelines so that we understand the time and steps required to obtain approval for a new course of this type? Government Response: The selected vendor will work with the Director of Education and Professional Development for the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection and the Chief Training Officer for the Office of Information Analysis to integrate DHS/Directorate/Office and Intelligence Community specific writing, analytic thinking and critical information needs and materials unique to aforementioned organizations into the curriculum.  At present, there are no approval guidelines established.  The approval process involves working with the POC referenced above to create acceptable course syllabus and to instruct the courses. Question 2:  The solicitation states that this is a Performance-based FFP contract.  We are very experienced in the management of Performance-based contracts which are becoming standard in many areas.  PB contracts
typically reference one or more performance metrics against which
performance is assessed.  What metrics will be established and applied to this training contract? Government Response: Performance metrics will be based on key performance standards in the PWS identified at at time of contract award and included in the award document, as modified. Question 3:  The solicitation briefly mentions the use of an "on-line format" for instruction, but doesn't detail expectations for the delivery
of on-line content.  What guidance is available on the extent to which instructor-led training needs to either be partially supported by on-line content (read-ahead and some course material accessible via a password-protected online learning environment, for example), or should the entire course be mirrored in a real-time on-line environment such that it
can be taught to non-DC based students?  Would the on-line content be available on an internal government network, either classified or SBU? And/or will unclassified portions of the on-line content be available through password-protected learning environments on the Internet? Government Response: The selected vendor will primarily instruct in a classroom environment although as stated in the SOW Scope of Work..."will combine instructor-led and (to the maximum extent possible) online learning formats".  At present, the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection anticipates at a minimum the potential need for students to submit materials and assignments via electronic medium to instructors however that has yet to be determined and as such, a decision will not be made until after review of the quotes and syllabi from contractors responding to the RFQ.  The Directorate desires that this course be constructed in such a manner as to make it accessible in an instructor led format as well as in an on-line format.  If offered in an online format, anticipate that it will be offered over government secure systems. Any remote students (outside of the DC area) attending an instructor-led class will be brought to the DC area at government expense (contractors are not required to factor this into their quote). Question 4:  The solicitation references "templates and examples of written products" that must be referenced in the training.  So that we can accurately estimate how long it will take to integrate these products into the training we develop, how many templates and written products will be referenced, what is their format and length, and can you give us an example of a written product? Government Response: n the SOW Scope of Work section d, it is requested that "The course instruction will integrate a variety of “templates” and examples of written products used in DHS/IAIP and the IC, as well as those templates and forms used by many of the aforementioned governmental agencies. The contractor will work in close coordination with the DHS/IAIP Director of Education and Professional Development and his staff to identify applicable templates and forms and integrate them into the course.  The contractor should be prepared to modify (integrate templates and other related forms into their existing course(s) NMT 15% to accommodate DHS/Directorate/Office specific needs. 
Question 5:  The solicitation requires that a total amount for the base period and each option period and an aggregate amount for all CLIN?s combined shall be provided.  Is it correct to assume that the reference to CLINs in this statement is "Course" CLINs only? Government Response: No. The total amounts for all CLIN's, which includes both course instruction and single rates for cost per additional trainee per class in excess of 20 trainees shall be added together to provide the aggregate amount for base period and option periods.

<DESC>Questions related to solicitation VA-101-05-RQ-054 1)	T.O. #1 asks for a reconciliation of the VA records to the Treasury for monthly reconciliations.  Is there a current state of records or history of reconciliations to date?  If so, are they available for the consultant to review? 	Yes and Yes.  The records will be available to the awarded financial consultant 2)	The VA narrative states thousands of transactions and numerous points of input to the VA system are made monthly which are by definition done each month.  Therefore, given the 50 hours for Task Order #1, are we to assume 4 hours per month is to be dedicated to the monthly reconciliation? 	Your assumption is correct.  Since this is a monthly reconciliation the 50 hours       	divided by 12 (months) comes to approximately 4 hours per month 3)	What level of VA staff participation has been allocated for this project? 	Minimal VA staff is allocated and the financial consultant will be working    	independently 	unless clarification or information is required 4)	Are the consultant’s efforts to be oversight of an existing process with general suggestions for improvement or does the VA expect the consultant to perform reconciliations and critique the system for corrective actions? 	The expectations of the financial consultant are to perform the monthly 	reconciliations and provide Journal Vouchers which are entries to correct the 	general ledger and fund balances 5)	Does the VA expect the consultant to implement corrective actions? 	Yes as mentioned in # 4 the Journal Vouchers 6)	What is the current reconciliation process and have corrective actions been taken as a matter of normal business practice? 	The current reconciliations are monthly reviews with Journal Vouchers processed 	when necessary 7)	What level of VA staff participation is allocated for monthly analysis of corrective measures or standardization of processes?   	Please see #3 and in addition VA staff reviews the Journal Vouchers (corrective 	measures) prior to submission into the financial system 8)	Is the information from the August 05 close available for review? 	Yes for the awarded consultant 9)	How did VA arrive at its’ estimate of 150 labor hours to satisfy the requirements of the task orders? 	The 150 hours were derived by the 50 hour breakdown as mentioned in #2 and 	100 hours were estimated for necessary travel to VACO and Austin Finance 	Center along with any additional time needed for end of fiscal year review  NOTE: THE 150 HOURS IS AN ANNUAL ESTIMATE NOT A MONTHLY ESTIMATE.
