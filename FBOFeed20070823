By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that Dell will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on site service and parts when necessary.  As this is a brand name only justification no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification.  Rather,the services identified by bran name herin have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. Due to CA's investemnt and overall satisfaction with Dell servers and the service Dell provides, it would be counter productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for Digital Video Systems Study. The Abort Flight Test of the Orion Command Module has the need to acquire high-rate video images in flight to assess the deployment of various parachute systems for stabilizing the capsule flight and for recovering the capsule at an acceptable rate. [SPECIFICATIONS] A study is envisioned to determine what imaging capability is possible from incorporating state-of-the-art technology to upgrade an existing Ecliptic Enterprises flight imaging system. The most important additional features are (1) the ability to capture high frame rate images at 200 frames per second and (2) to subsequently compress the video data stream so that it can be telemetered  to a ground station within the available telemetry data bandwidth. If the results from this study predict that the enhanced system will meet the AFT requirements, a prototype flight system will be built for evaluation. [SOLE SOURCE EXPLANATION] Ecliptic Enterprises Incorporated manufactures video imaging equipment designed for use in aerospace flight applications within the atmosphere and in space. The hardware is ruggedly fabricated to operate and survive in the extreme flight environments. The video imaging equipment is fabricated to interface with avionics equipment on the flight vehicle to synchronize timing and processing of video images that has proven to be an effective approach that is easy to use and configure for special situations. If other sources were used, the experience and design background that Ecliptic brings to the work would be lost and system designs would need to be re-engineered at an unacceptable cost in time and resources that the program cannot afford [FOLLOW-UP AND LEGAL] The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 6, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<ARCHDATE>10142007
<CONTACT>Robert Valdes, (202) 385-8644
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in a continuing effort to improve runway safety, has identified the need to implement RWSL Systems at selected airports. The purpose of this announcement is to inform interested industry participants of the FAA plans to procure the RWSL System in FY08. RWSL will directly aid in furthering the FAA mission goal of enhancing runway safety while maximizing operational efficiency and ensuring airport capacity. RWSL offers a means of reducing runway incursions considered as one of the most important aviation safety initiatives critical to improving runway safety and accident prevention. The RWSL System integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal indicating to pilots and vehicle operators that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on a runway. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway. The FAA has tested and proven the concept of RWSL and the viability of existing technologies via prototype systems currently in operation at Dallas Ft. Worth and San Diego airports. The main system components include: â¢	The RWSL Processor: The processor determines the appropriate activation and deactivation of the Runway Entrance Lights (RELs) and Takeoff Hold Lights (THLs) and sends the appropriate commands to the Field Lighting System (FLS). â¢	RWSL FLS:  The FLS includes a light control computer, in-pavement light fixtures, and all light system circuitry. The FLS receives the light commands and illuminates and extinguishes the lights as commanded by the RWSL Processor. o	RELs indicate that a runway is unsafe to enter o	THLs indicate that a runway is unsafe for departure The anticipated procurement of the RWSL system is expected to include the following requirements: â¢	Develop the source code required to enable the RWSL Processor to perform the RWSL light control functions and to interface with the existing surface surveillance system and the FLS,  â¢	Installation of RWSL FLS at designated airport runways/taxiways, â¢	Integrate the RWSL Processor and RWSL FLS so as to achieve FAA standards applicable to a fully operational component of the NAS, â¢	Development, production, and field testing of a RWSL prototype (First Article),  â¢	Production, delivery, and installation of RWSL systems defined as production deliverables,  â¢	Logistics including training development and engineering support. â¢	 Utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)hardware and software to the maximum extent possible The specific objectives of this public announcement are as follows: â¢	To inform interested industry participants that the FAA has identified the procurement of RWSL as a planned acquisition in FY08.  â¢	Gauge industry capability and interest in actively participating in a competitive procurement.  â¢	Solicit industry feedback to the enclosed FAA RWSL system operational design concept as described in the enclosed DOT FAA NAS High Level System Description for RWSL. Specifically, industry suggestions for alternative hardware architectures which may provide equivalent functionality to that described herein. Additionally, the FAA is interested in the risks industry may identify in connection with the operational design concept, and what mitigation strategies industry can propose. â¢	Solicit industry feedback to the below RWSL High Level Procurement Schedule:   Runway Status Lights Milestone	                      Projected Completion Date Joint Resources Council (JRC) Initial Investment Decision	July 2007 Request for Offer	                                        January 2008 Vendors' Submit Proposals	                                April 2008 JRC Final Investment Decision	                            July 2008 Contract Award	                                           August 2008 â¢	Request interested industry participants to submit a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the Software Lines of Code (SLOC) for the RWSL Processor to achieve the operational performance described by the enclosed DOT FAA NAS High Level System Description for RWSL, RWSL Preliminary Requirements Document (PRD), and RWSL Engineering Brief (EB) 64a. The FAA considers the data made available herein adequate as the basis for developing a ROM for SLOC. â¢	The reference documents noted above represent the current versions thereof and are subject to change.  However, the DOT FAA NAS High Level System Description for RWSL is more current than the PRD.  The PRD is being updated to a final version. Contractors interested in assisting the FAA in this effort are invited to respond to this announcement by submitting a capabilities statement, not to exceed 10 pages in length, addressing the following: â¢	Provide a synopsis of experience gained with systems that form part of the NAS, and in particular, familiarity with NAS requirements. â¢	Provide a synopsis of experience gained in the area of software development and integration particularly suited to interfacing separate systems, which when linked, provide expanded capabilities. â¢	Provide a synopsis describing experience gained in performing and management of construction projects within airport grounds and in particular the airport movement area (runways and taxiways). â¢	Provide a synopsis of experience gained in the development, testing, manufacturing, installation, and life cycle sustainment of complex electronic systems.   Please note that respondents should not include any information deemed proprietary. Also note that information requested herein, or responding to this announcement will not result in the elimination of any industry participant from further consideration.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR OFFER. THE FAA WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY COSTS RELATED TO RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Responses or questions to this announcement may be submitted via hard copy or email to the address noted below. Email responses are preferred.

<DESC>THE USDA, ARS, USALARC intends to purchase one version of a software program called EthoVision Color-Pro 3.1 Animal Behavior Software from Noldus Information Technology (NIT).  This is a highly sophisticated software program dedicated to video tracking animals for behavioral research.  To our knowledge, NIT is the sole source provider of an insect (video) tracking software that can simultaneously track the behavior of multiple subjects. This system has the unique ability to simultaneously monitor the interactions of up to 16 individual insects within the same arena (which is of paramount importance for many of our studies examining mating behavior, predator behavior, etc.).  Moreover, the software can be programmed to concurrently monitor single individuals in multiple arenas (which eliminates the need for direct observation of the individuals ? one at a time). Furthermore, EthoVision software is fully compatible with other products that we have purchased from NIT in the past (e.g, The Observer 5.0, VideoPro and MatMan).

A solicitation is not available for this requirement, but interested parties may submit proposals to the attention of Regan Alexander as listed above.   See numbered note 22.  Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations with Noldus Information Technology will be held without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 07, 2007.

<DESC>The USDA, ARS, USALARC intends to purchase from Seed Research Equipment Solutions (SRES) one 4 Row vacuum Mini-Seed planter, MS 4-3-0, Bersion A 40" row spacing.  Includes rigid 5 X 5 Tool Bar Frame, adjustable Drive Wheels, seed spacing transmission, secondary air system, vacuum cleanout, Turbofan with PTO drive, rubber front wheels, narrow shoes.  Includes 4 wire mesh rear press wheels in-lieu of stainless steele flat press, with 4 cover assembly air MS.  Includes set-up and onsite training and freight to laboratory in USALARC, Maricopa, AZ.

This is a specialty built piece of equipment.  SRES is the only company that we have found that builds individual row seed-drop, self cleaning and loading vacuum air planters, for seed this small and for small plot planting.  Each Lesquerella seed weighs only .06 mg.  This planter meets the specifications for our needs and allows the flexibility of adding or deleting custom options to the equipment.  The investigating individual spent the past year interviewing other ARS, public, and private scientists concerning companies that built custom plot planters.  He also visited equipment company booths at technical conferences to determine if various companies built custom small plot planters.  Eight companies making planters for small seeded vegetables and flowers were contacted, but they did not have a suitable planter.  Numerous phone calls were made and no other companies were identified.  A web search failed to identify any further companies that build vacuum air planters capable of planting small research plots with small seed.

A solicitation is not available for this requirement, but interested parties may submit proposals to the attention of Regan Alexander as listed above.   See numbered note 22.  Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice.  If no affirmative written responses are received, this contract will be awarded to Noldus Information Technology without further notice.

The existing gage block comparator must work with other gage block comparators (Model 130B-16) that the FRC East currently has and the new one must be compatible with the others.  Procuring the same gage block comparator will also avoid additional maintenance costs.  Delivery shall be made to:  Fleet Readiness Center East, Receiving Officer, Cherry Point, NC.

The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the CLIN(S) required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.  Proposals shall be valid for a period of thirty (30) days.  Applicable Provisions and Clauses.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a!   web-based system that centralizes  and standardizes the collection, s torage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitation.  With OCRA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer.  To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into OCRA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provi!  sions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provision .  You will need to review and/or update your OCRA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding OCRA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on OCRAS homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  Full text of FAR and DFAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure integrated modeling and simulation (M&S) and Battle Lab support for the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM).  The USJFCOM requires support to design, execute, and assess plans, applications, processes and events in the C4ISR field with an emphasis on the use of M&S in an expanded Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environment.  Support is required to test, demonstrate and evaluate a variety of simulation concepts, serve as a cost efficient method of site certification, event coordination, criteria evaluation and to provide an independent analysis of applications and tools.  Support is required during the period from 1 February 2008 through 31 January 2010 with two (2) option periods that will also be two (2) years each.  It is intended to procure the required support on a sole source basis from Old Dominion University Research Foundation (ODURF) pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  ODURF is the only source with a Battle Lab and M&S program for command and control programs that parallels the needs of the USJFCOM.  ODURF is the only source that supports the integration of LVC simulations for C4 applications and that possesses all of the major military models needed by the USJFCOM M&S support requirements.  ODURF is the only source with the requisite resident expertise related to the integration of LVC simulations into Joint Command and Control.  ODURF has the capability to host a persistent version of USJFCOM's Joint Federation that can directly and continuously support the ongoing integration of simulation federates and underpin the joint training and experimentation mission of the USJFCOM.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 541511 and the small business size standard is $23,000,000.00.  Numbered notes 22 and 26 apply.

<SUBJECT>59--REPLACEMENT GRAPHICS CARD
<SOLNBR>N0016707Q5288
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 56 provides support including installation, testing and shipboard operation of the Seawolf Class Portable Ship Control Unit (PSCU). To repair a failed PSCU, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with WEMS Electronics in Hawthorne, CA for one (1) replacement Graphics Card 6956647 (also L535 111 015). WEMS Electronics last produced this graphics card about 5 years ago for Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC), of Manassas, VA, and is the only company that has produced this graphics card. Additionally, they are the only entity in possession of the drawings, schematics and instructions to produce additional cards. The Graphics Card was proprietary to LMC. The Navy never received full technical documentation to enable NSWCCD to bid/build/manufacture these cards independently, but has received approval and a waving of proprietary rights from LMC for the Navy to have additional units fabricate!  d. Even though LMC has since lost some of the critical documentation for the Graphic Card, WEMS Electronics has saved all the documentation and information they need to reproduce more Graphic Cards. As such they are the only company that is able to produce these cards with out reverse engineering and the ensuing reduction in quality and cost of first article testing. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 09/07/2007 and referencing RFQ N00167-07-Q-5288.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 613, has a requirement to determine cavitations erosion resistance of coatings that are being considered for potential use as LCAC lift fan blade coatings. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Dynaflow Inc. (DynaFlow), located in Jessup, MD to provide specialized technical services to support its research and development efforts through conduct of preliminary small scale testing, visualizations, investigation of cavitations erosion issues, development of measurement techniques, and comparison of cavitations erosion resistance characteristics of selected coatings. Dynaflow's expertise in cavitations erosion testing and characterizations as well as the equipment available are unique.  DynaFlow has a suitable experimental test assembly, complete with high speed video equipment, intended to test the type of phenomena of interest to NSWCCD.  Dr. Georges Chahine is the principal investigator for this work and has extensive experience in cavitations erosion testing, flow visualization and numerical analysis.  Current research indicates that DynaFlow, Inc. has developed an alternative cavitations erosion test method for testing a material for erosion resistance. The cavitations generated by a cavitating jet provides realistic cavitations bubble clouds with distribution of various size micro bubbles, shear flows with vortices, and hemi-spherical bubble clouds around the test sample. The cavitating jet is also flexible that any sample shapes can be used as long as the size and weight are in a manageable range. The method is faster than the ASTM G-32-98, a standard test method for cavitations erosion using vibratory apparatus. DynaFlow will support NSWCCD's research and development efforts through conduct of erosion testing using cavitations jets for several coatings intended to be put on LCAC lift fan blades. The results are to be presented in terms of damage versus time. For comparative purposes, the results are also presented in removal rates per energy spent. All responsible sour!  ces submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 09/07/2007 and referencing RFQ N00167-07-Q-5291.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) â San Diego intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price contract to Law Enforcement Associates Inc., 100 Hunter Place, Youngsville, North Carolina 27596 on a sole source basis for the purchase of 30 units of the Wireless Video Kit.    This sole source procurement is in support of the Technology Transfer Program (TTP) at the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC), Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Law Enforcement Associates Inc. is the original developer and sole manufacturer of the Wireless Video Kit.    The Wireless Video Kit is a covert, wireless surveillance system that incorporates four (4) disguised audio/video transmitters  for both on-the-body and off-the-body applications.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in an unacceptable delay and a duplication of cost associated with developing/testing a new product that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  It should be noted that a new competition to identify state-of-the- art technologies for law enforcement counterdrug operations in support of the TTP is planned beginning 3rd Qtr 2008.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334220, and the size standard is 750 employees.   The anticipated period of performance will be approximately one year with an estimated value of $645K.   Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to Esther E. Christianson at esther.christianson@navy.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) â San Diego intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price contract to Tactical Technologies Inc., 500 Pine Street, Suite 3-A, Holmes Corporate Center, Holmes, Pennsylvania 19043 on a sole source basis for the purchase of 11 units of the JOEY J2 Series Transcorder and 2 units of training.    This sole source procurement is in support of the Technology Transfer Program (TTP) at the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC), Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).    Tactical Technologies Inc. is the original developer and sole manufacturer of the JOEY J2 Series Transcorder.  The JOEY J2 Series Transcorder is a covert audio transcorder system that combines a 500mW body worn transmitter with a self-contained digital recorder.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in an unacceptable delay and a duplication of cost associated with developing/testing a new product that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  It should be noted that a new competition to identify state-of-the-art technologies for law enforcement counterdrug operations in support of the TTP is planned beginning 3rd Qtr 2008.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334220, and the size standard is 750 employees.   The anticipated period of performance will be approximately one year with an estimated value of $131K.   Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to Esther E. Christianson at esther.christianson@navy.mil.  See numbered note 22.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13.  Organizations that believe they are capable of performing the described work may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30pm EST on September 5, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for one (1 EA)Oculometer System.  The oculometer system will be used to measure eye gaze point and head pointing data on pilots in aircraft motion base simulators and during test flights.     NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Smart Eye, who is the only responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy Agency requirements. Smart Eye's unique features are: uses remote cameras, requires no intrusive eyewear, helmet or headset; camera can expanded from its' original three camera configuration to a six camera configuration to provide better tracking within a larger head box; camera placement is not required to be fixed, thus cameras can be placed in available locations in an aircraft cockpit without having to extensively modify the aircraft instrument panel.	Smart Eye's oculometer system matches the data collection software already available and funded, thus saving the expense and time delay of having to develop new software from scratch.	The Smart Eye is the only product through market research which possesses all these qualities.	  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 6, 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a level of effort, time and materials order to procure detailed written procedures to design changes to the engine oil tank for the CH-46 series helicopter, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The CH-46E engine oil tank assemblies, A15P3518-1, are experiencing high failure rates due to handling damage and repeated repairs.  Boeing, the airframe OEM, will incorporate design improvements into the oil tank and associated aircraft support structure to eliminate the problem areas on the supply ports and increase the durability of the design by adding doublers to the supply and vent ports. Additional strapping will also be added under the non-cradle regions and a third band clamp will be added to the assembly to better secure the tank the aircraft. This design effort includes the design engineering, stress analysis, and the update of associated drawings (kit and manufacturing) to reflect the new configuration.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Ridley Park, PA for an estimated period of performance of eight months after the date of contract award.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the H-46 series helicopter and retains exclusive proprietary rights to all technical data.  The Boeing Company is the only firm that possesses the knowledge, experience, technical expertise and technical data required to perform these efforts.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Optical Technology Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Spectrum Detector, Incorporated of Lake Oswego, OR for Model SDX-1004 Pyroelectric Hybrid Detectors, Model SDX-1005 TEC Pyroelectric Hybrid with T Controller and P.S., Model SDX-1006-OB Pyroelectric WedgeTrap and Model SDX-1006-NT Pyroelectric WedgeTraps.

Sole source determination is based on the following:  The purchases of the above listed Models are required from Spectrum Detectors. Spectrum Detectors is the sole vendor capable of implementing the frequency compensation method, which was discovered by NIST, using the special organic black pyroelectric detector coating. NIST has also developed calibration methods for similar pyroelectric detectors within a Missile Defense Agency project, and the compatibility with the existing calibrated detectors and detector calibrations is a must. No other vendor is capable of producing low NEP, high absorption, high roll off frequency, improved spatial uniformity of responsivity, and temperature dependent responsivity correction within 0.06 percent, as required. 

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by September 06, 2007, will be considered by the Government.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Army Sustainment Command is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey for potential sources to recapitalize approximately 7,500 to 50,000 155mm M864A1 Extended Range, Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) projectiles for FY08 throug h FY12.  The recapitalization process involves removal of the expulsion charge and baseburner assemblies, download of the M42/M46 grenade payload from the projectile, removal of the existing M223 impact-initiating grenade fuze, attachment of a pyrotechnic Self Destruct Fuze (p-SDF) and Load, Assembly and Pack (LAP) of the projectile reusing the fuzed grenades and expulsion charge and baseburner assemblies.  The requirements shall potentially be broken down into the following increments:  up to 1,500 project iles for FY08 and approximately 1,500 to 12,000 projectiles per year for FY09-12.  It is anticipated that this resulting requirement will be restricted to the National Technology and Industrial Base (United States and Canada). Respondents must demonstrate that they have the capability to download M864 projectiles, replace the existing grenade fuze with a p-SDF that meets a less than one percent unexploded ordnance requirement, and LAP 155mm projectiles with available skills, equipment, personnel, and facili ties.  A respondent to this Market Survey should be able to show that they have the Technical Capabilities, Manufacturing Capacity and good past performance as indicators of existing qualifications.  Interested companies who have the necessary capabilities  should respond by providing the following information:  A summary of your companys capabilities; description of facilities, personnel, and manufacturing capabilities and experiences, and how they relate directly to the planned procurement; and your estim ated minimum and maximum monthly production capacities.  Interested companies should also state if they have performed this effort in the past.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of a sub-tier vendor or subcontractor, the same information ide ntified above that the interested party provides should also be provided for the vendors or subcontractors.  A TDP is not available for this announcement; however, one will be made available should a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) be released at a later  date.  Offerors should have the ability to provide required information based upon the product information provided above.  Responses to this survey shall be submitted via email within 15 days of the release of this publication to HQ, Army Sustainment Com mand, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-R/Adria Hemmen & Chris Calhoun, Rock Island, IL 61299-6500.

<SOLNBR>W911PT07R0024

<ARCHDATE>11062007
<CONTACT>Sherman Mayle, 518 266-4631
<DESC>These forgings are needed to finish testing on prototype guns for a new weapons system that has a significant reduction in weight.  A good portion of the the weight reduction is due to a new high strength, high toughness steel currently not available  in the production of large caliber guns. This contract action is the acquisition of forgings which have been determined to be available from only one responsible source.  In order to satisfy cannon safety testing requirements we must utilize the same identical forging materials as were used in th e original cannon prototypes, therefore we must obtain the forgings from the same contractor who provided the orginal forgings. It is not feasible to use a different source at this time, however, once testing is completed future requirements are expected t o be competed. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest.  However, as this acquisition is associated with  an earlier contract they will not receive the proposal for the reasons mentioned above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to  this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THE PROPOSAL RECEIPT DEADLINE IS CHANGED TO 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME, DECEMBER 21, 2007.

Introduction<br/>
<br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<br/>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about August 15, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

<DESC>DRAFT SRD Info (23 Aug 07): Attached is the draft System Requirements Document (SRD) for the T-38C  Improved Brake System Program (IBSP).  We will be having a telecon on  Wed - 5 Sep 07, from 1400 to 1500 (2-3 pm EST) to answer questions and  address any concerns on the SOO or SRD.  The toll-free dial in number is  888-381-5770 and the Participant Code is 39205. We are requesting that you  submit written questions by Fri - 31 Aug 07, to Ms Karen Shelley.  We will  record each question submitted prior to the telecon anonymously as a  "Contractor Question," and if possible, we will address each question  during the telecon.  If time allows, additional questions will be fielded  during the telecon, and if possible a real-time "Government Answer."  In  the event we need to conduct further research, the answer will be included  in a follow-on PIXS posting that records each "Contractor Question" and  the "Government Answer."   Again, if possible, please send your questions  in advance to the Contract Negotiator (karen.shelley@wpafb.af.mil).  The  toll number for foreign companies is 1-210-839-8503 and please use the  above Participant Code. DRAFT SOO Info (17 Aug 07): The attached draft IBSP Statement of Objectives (SOO) is being released  for Industry comment. In the next two weeks we will also be releasing the  draft System Requirement Document, a draft Section M and a draft Section L  for Industry comment.   Please send written comments to Ms Karen Shelley  (Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil) and in the r-mail subject line please add the  name of the document to which the comments refer (EX:  SOO - Comments,  SRD - Comments). Be advised, that it is likely that the complete DRFP release will be  delayed until Sep and RFP release not until Oct.  If you have any  questions, you can contact the acting program manager, George Sarmiento,  at his new e-mail address:  george.sarmiento2@wpafb.af.mil or myself. Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8 ½ x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.	Describe your present technical capability and past aircraft-specific history of meeting similar requirements. 2.	Describe in some detail your companys proposed approach for meeting  this requirement. 3.	Identify any commercial item solutions that your company will  incorporate into proposed design. 4.	Identify any non-developmental solutions currently used on military aircraft that your company will incorporate into proposed design. 5.	Describe what portion of the proposed work will be accomplished  in-house versus subcontracting. 6.	Describe the technical risk and problem areas for this requirement, including any anticipated interfaces/technical inputs required to  implement a (system) solution. 7.	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline (proposed schedule) of major milestones. 8.	Describe proposed support approach 9.

<DESC>The government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type purchase order for material in accordance with FAR part 13.5 (Clinger-Cohen), for Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight (EODMU8) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The material is required for EODMU8 to provide for the safety of the forward deployed units of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thermo?s Identifinder is a lightweight hand held device used to identify isotopes when radiation is present or suspected.  It captures a spectrum which is immediately compared to its internal library of isotopes for instantaneous computer interpretation of the isotopes present.  The spectrum is then downloaded and transmitted to Subject Matter Experts (SME) at the Department of Energy (DOE) for further analysis.  This acquisition is in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Government?s minimum needs have been verified by Certifying technical and requirements personnel.  This requirement is for items solely manufactured by Thermo Scientific.  The IdentiFinder, p/n IDF-EODKIT, is a patented unit and therefore is only available through Thermo Scientific.  Thermo Scientific, 27 Forge Pky, Franklin, MA 02038, is also the only know source of supply for this unit.  Substitutes in brand name would not be feasible because this is a technical unit requiring extensive training in the operation and is already in use in the field by other EOD units.  
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.  A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 9 JULY, 2007.  All responsible sources must submit pricing and past performance data by 3:00 p.m. on the date the offer is due.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>B -- Follow-up technical assistance on approved conservation plans for CRP
<SOLNBR>PR105420
<RESPDATE>082807
<ARCHDATE>10152008
<CONTACT>Alonzo Jacobs, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9471, Fax 202-690-0689, Email alonzo.jacobs@wdc.usda.gov
<DESC>This Amendment is issued to provide the following Questions and Answers to the RFP Number: PR105420 / AG-3151-S-07-0035, entitled "Follow-up Technical Assistance on Existing Conservation Plans". QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES
To Solicitation No. AG 3151-S-07-0035
Follow-Up Technical Assistance to 390 Conservation Plans


1.)	Can you provide an average acreage of each of the CRP contracts?   

USDA RESPONSE:  Information requested is not available.
 
2.)	It appears there are multiple pieces to the scope of work as indicated in Section
C.3., of the RFP.  Is it acceptable to provide a firm-fixed price per each element of the scope of work?  It will be very difficult to roll all the scope of work elements into one price because it appears that some of the elements will not be required on all CRP contracts, for example, elements C.3.2 and C.3.4 may only be required on a subset of the CRP contracts.  If we have to roll all the costs into one fixed price, then we need some idea of the percentage of the CRP contracts that will require these ?occasional? items.  

USDA RESPONSE: 
CEPD designed the SOW to require a one flat fee per contract regardless of the type follow up Technical Assistance work, per year.  CEPD has no data to support a task by task form of pricing.  We are basing our per contract rate on what NRCS has charged for similar work in the past.  We realize as is customary in a ?Fixed Price contract? arrangement, that FSA may take a hit on the price of those contracts that require little Technical Assistance work, however, the contractor may take a bit of hit with some contracts that may require a bit more work than another.  We in CEPD feel it will balance itself out and while in this contract we can work on a task by task comparison.  However, until then we only have the basis and data to support a set price per contract per year.
 
3.)	Do you want the firm-fixed price to include only labor or labor and travel expenses?  Because the contractor has to visit every site, travel will be required.  Paragraph C.7 of the RFP states that all travel must be approved in writing, in advance, by the COTR. 

USDA RESPONSE:  The contract price from the contractor should include an estimated cost of travel to and from possible sites.  Travel to sites will be paid at actual cost in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations.  Contractor must submit documentation to support all travel costs.  Any travel to the national office in Washington, DC must receive prior approval by the COTR.
 
4.)	Do you want us to provide a labor rate schedule to determine potential labor costs for scope of work items such as C.3.2 that only occur on an occasional basis? 

USDA RESPONSE:  Answered in response provided for #2.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES
To Solicitation No. AG 3151-S-07-0035
Follow-Up Technical Assistance to 390 Conservation Plans

This amendment to RFP PR105420/AG-3151-S-07-0035 is issued to provide the following information in response to the questions listed. 

This Amendment also extends the Due date for receipt of proposals.

1). In Section C.3.3 in the Scope of Work, the RFP states that the review of CPR participant practices be completed within 15 calendar days of notification by the FSA county office.  Is it possible to extend this timeline in the event of weather-related issues, (e.g. winter) or to bundle several CRP site visits together within a county?  In other words, it will not be cost-effective to make multiple trips to a county to conduct individual CRP site visits, if the work is spread out. 
 
USDA RESPONSE: The 15 calendar day is a policy determination and is required by CRP policy.  Should there be a natural disaster or other act of God that would delay a participant for more than 15 days a possible waiver could be awarded.  However, that waiver would need to be submitted to the FSA National Office Program Manager (PM), and it would be at the PM?s discretion to grant such a waiver.
 The site visits need to be completed on a timely basis.  Payment can not be held up because participant A's waterway was done in week one, but wasn't inspected until week 4 when the contractor inspected his/her bundled site visits. 

2). May the offerors propose on any or all of the States and Counties? 

USDA RESPONSE: Offerors are required to submit proposals on an All or None basis. Offers are NOT being accepted on quantities that are less than the entire list of States as shown in the solicitation.

Reference is made to the 1 August 2007 announcement, reference number 06-51023B, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal to develop a feasibility study for the Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center project.

On August 17, 2007, USTDA received an inquiry requesting clarification regarding Task III-1 of the Terms of Reference, titled "Perform Security Requirement Analysis."  The inquiry requests whether the main objective of Task III-1 is to review Panama's policies and agency capabilities, including technology, in responding to or preventing security incidents or provide a formal security vulnerability analysis and assessment of marine operations in Panama.  In consultation with the Garibaldi Consulting Group, USTDA hereby provides the following clarification:

Task III-1 requires that the selected Contractor perform a security requirements analysis of the AMP.  In support of this task the Contractor will need to identify the major vulnerabilities and deficiencies in the AMP's existing security procedures, systems and facilities. This is effectively an analysis of the "gaps" between where the AMP is (i.e., its current capabilities) and where it should be (i.e., its future requirements). This is not intended to be a full-blown, formalized vulnerability analysis of all of the marine facilities in Panama.  However, the level of detail of this analysis does need to be sufficient to allow the Contractor to determine what are the critical upgrades to technology, infrastructure, procedures and operating practices that will help AMP address its current and emerging security threats.

USTDA is sharing this information for the benefit of all prospective bidders.

The response date for this RFP remains 12:00 PM LOCAL TIME, September 7, 2007.

<u>Proposal Submission Place:</u>
Mr. Ivor Pitti, Panama Maritime Authority, Diablo Heights Edificio 5534, Estafeta 0843, Apartado 00533, Balboa, Ancon, Panama, Tel:011-507-232-8973, Fax:011-507-501-5255 

<b><u>Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center</b></u>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center.

AMP is an autonomous government agency established in 1998 to unify the maritime responsibilities of the National Port Authority; the Directorate of Vessels and Consular Affairs within the Ministry of Treasury and Finance; the Directorate of Marine Resources within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Nautical School of Panama within the Ministry of Education.

The Government of Panama (GOP) is interested in implementing security measures which meet international maritime trade security standards. These international security initiatives include 24-hour manifests, Container Security Initiative (CSI), Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), the International Maritime Organization's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Long Range Identification and Tracking Systems (LRIT), Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) and Vessel Monitoring Services (VMS).  The implementation of the Center would help AMP to manage the compliance of the entire Panamanian maritime sector with these international security standards while more effectively, efficiently and safely processing the increasing volume of commercial cargo and vessel traffic in the principal ports of Balboa, Col?n and Crist?bal.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $331,341 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>. Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 PM LOCAL TIME, September 7, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The primary objective of this standa rdization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Sterile Powder-Free Surgical Gloves products that represent the clinically preferred product.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program .  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army M edical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.

In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) AND a separate commercial agreement with the  DoD Prime Vendor(s) for the program.

Evaluation Criteria:  The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the deci sion makers for this initiative and evaluate the recommendations from the Clinical Product Team (CPT).  The CPT is comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines applicable to the product line under review. The CPT will initially rate the tech nical criteria.  A rating of zero on technical criteria number one will disqualify the vendor from further participation in this solicitation.  All other technical criteria will be weighted equally.  Vendors achieving an overall technical score of 26 or hi gher will be invited to participate in the clinical evaluation.  Those receiving a technical rating below 26 will be notified of their elimination from further participation.  Those vendors who meet the technical criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical evaluation and will be asked to supply samples for evaluation and submit a best price offer.  Vendors are required to supply samples at no cost to the government.  A three-week period will be allotted to vendors to supply evaluation products.  Vendors failing to supply samples will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The CPT will evaluate Sterile Powder-Free Surgical Gloves products and recommend the preferred product based upon clinical evaluation of the  products.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale from one (Strongly Disagree - worst score) to five (Strongly Agree - best score).  All clinical criteria are weighted equally.  Minimum clinical acceptabil ity is considered a total average score of three or above on a five scale rating.  Clinical results lower than three will be considered unacceptable and products will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Vendors should submit a best price offer based on committed volume of 80% of th e total requirements of the MTFs in the Central Region and with required discounted pricing off DAPA price based on both a single vendor award and the potential for a multi-vendor award.  However, multi-vendor award pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. E. Technical Criteria Evaluation:  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical criteria includes responses to al l questions in this section that demonstrate the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of the subject medical/surgical consumables; and, based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line  or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. 1.	Company supplied DAPA number or DAPA log number documenting request for DAPA, with solicitation response. (0 = no; 5 = yes)  Note: a rating of zero on technical criteria number one will disqualify the vendor from further participation in this solicitati on. 2.

<DESC>The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative's (DeVenCI) Critical Defense Priorities Sector will conduct a workshop on Power and Energy on October 30 & 31 in the Washington, DC area. The workshop will provide selected innovative companies who do not normally conduct business with the Department of Defense with an opportunity to make short presentations to DoD representatives about their technologies and products. DeVenCI is looking for companies who have Power and Energy solutions in energy storage at higher densities and/or energy independence in remote locations. DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs. Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before September 6, 2007. Selected companies will be responsible for travel and all other expenses associated with their participation in this workshop.

<DESC>Request for Information

Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (DHS/ICE)

Full Service Case Management with Electronic Monitoring Devices    

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DHS/ICE is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at responder expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information.  

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  Detention and Removal Operations, Alternatives to Detention Unit issues this Request for Information regarding full service case management, including electronic monitoring device installation and management, for supervision of non-United States citizens released from ICE custody into the community, who reside within a managed service area.  The goal of this RFI is to identify companies with readily available assets that can develop and operate a case management program that incorporates electronic monitoring technology, supervision services, and day reporting centers specific to the needs of DRO.
 
Contractors as well as Government personnel will review the responses to the RFI, unless the Responder specifically states that only the Government may view the submission.  Responders are advised that their submissions will receive greater consideration if the entire Government and Contractor team can assess its potential.

Background

DHS/ICE/DRO is the primary agency responsible for managing the administrative process to determine if non-US citizens may enter or remain in the United States, commonly known as removal proceedings.  ICE/DRO currently has more than 30,000 aliens in custody each day.  The majority of bed space is currently used for mandatory detention cases and the need to manage the remaining bed space is high.  
The Alternatives to Detention Unit within ICE/DRO supervises aliens who are not detained in DHS custody.  Congress has specifically earmarked funding for ATD programs as one way of addressing the multitude of issues associated with illegal immigration and detention space issues.  To improve ATD functions, the ATD unit must implement contractor case management tasks to focus on home and office visits, electronic monitoring programs, and the acquisition of travel documents for departure from the United States.  The DHS/ICE/DRO Alternatives to Detention Unit is currently exploring new case management services and supervision technologies that can encompass DRO requirements, yet remain flexible in the selection and frequency of those services.  Services shall include monitoring and reporting program compliance, including positive and negative program termination, absconder rates, appearance at immigration hearings, and length of time in program modules and provide a cost effective solution versus secure detention to provide progressive supervision for aliens who are released from ICE custody to the community.  The supervision technologies are to include, but are not limited to, non-removable bracelets using radio frequency (RF) or GPS (active and passive) that operate either over landline or cellular technology, and multi-lingual telephonic reporting.

              Temporary Housing  
    Joint Housing Solutions Group Initiative

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: 
DHS - Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Assistance Directorate, 500 C Street, S.W., Room 350, Washington, DC, 20472

DESCRIPTION: 

FEMA is seeking to partner directly with the industry to provide quality housing which meets the needs of Americans after a disaster strikes.  To provide "Alternative Housing Assistance other than Travel Trailors for Disaster Victims."  To aid with this effort, FEMA is seeking input from the industry concerning housing solutions which can be used to quickly and effectively house displaced victims for durations both short and long-terms.   The Joint Housing Solutions Group (JHSG), created and headed by FEMA to spearhead this initiative, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) seeking industry?s input. 

The goals of this Request for Information (RFI) are twofold:  
1) Identify and evaluate a broad range of housing options that can supplement existing stocks of travel trailer, park models and manufactured homes.
2) Seek industry?s input into whether existing production capacity will be sufficient to meet the demands of a variety of declared disasters. 
To respond to this RFI, FEMA invites industry to complete the Housing Assessment Tool (HAT) online at https://asd.fema.gov/inter/hat/home.htm  The HAT is designed to collect preliminary but critical information on housing products and help FEMA determine if these options are suitable for disaster housing needs.  The HAT helps assess the difference between proposed products and existing options (i.e., Recreational Vehicles, Manufactured Homes), specifically with respect to their design and safety performance, livability, costs, and timeliness.  The HAT is a comprehensive tool: it contains a great deal of questions, and may require collaborative response from multiple individuals within your company.  Providers will be able to create a company profile in the HAT, and submit multiple housing options.  More detail instructions will be provided on the HAT, and JHSG staff will be available to assist you throughout the process.  
FEMA appreciates any and all replies to this RFI. All responses are to be used solely by FEMA as research and will not divulge individual responses to the RFI.  The RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. 


POINT OF CONTACT:
Should you have any questions regarding the RFI and/or the Housing Assessment Tool please email FEMA-JHSG@dhs.gov or contact by phone (202)646-2980.
Please submit the HAT via the internet by September 10, 2007

Statement of Work

Mine Safety and Health Administration
National Air and Dust Laboratory
Mount Hope, West Virginia


This Statement of Work (hereinafter ?SOW?) is made to be entered into by and between Mine Safety and Health Administration (hereinafter ?Purchaser?) and the selected robotics system vendor (hereinafter ?Vendor?), for the selection and purchase of an appropriate process automation robot to be utilized in the laboratory analysis of mine atmosphere samples for the presence and quantity of poisonous or explosive gases, and the quality of air in which the miners breathe.  This SOW incorporates by reference the terms and conditions which will be detailed in an official Purchaser Purchase Order between the Purchaser and selected Vendor.  The terms and conditions of this SOW cannot conflict with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Order.  In case of any conflict, the Purchase Order shall prevail.

Now therefore, Purchaser and Vendor mutually agree as follows:


Objective

The goal of this SOW is to update the robotics automation system currently in use in the Air Section of MSHA?s National Air and Dust Laboratory.  This laboratory analyzes mine air samples for the presence of poisonous or explosive gases, and coal mine dust samples for total incombustible content (TIC), particle size, and coke and silica content.  This is the sole MSHA facility that performs the routine mine inspection air analysis procedure, and the test is done for all MSHA coal districts nationwide.  Samples are also analyzed for many Metal/Non-metal field offices across the nation.  The Air Lab utilizes a Zymark Zymate XP robot to automate the routine air sample analysis.  Significant increases in the number of mine air samples submitted for analysis, and aging and outdated systems have reduced the robot?s effectiveness and created unacceptable periods of down-time due to equipment failure and repair.

Scope and Description of Work

1.	The Vendor will provide an updated, state-of-the-art system automation robot to replace the aging equipment currently in use in the air laboratory.  The updated robot will be designed and programmed to work within the current robotics system set-up, utilizing existing equipment such as vial racks, injection systems, and chromatographic equipment.  The robot and all automatic functions shall be driven by an existing compressed air system within the laboratory.
2.	The robotics system will analyze up to two hundred (200) air samples per analytical run.  The robot will select the first sample vial, which has been properly logged and prepped by a laboratory technician.  The robot will place this vial into the sample injection station for injection onto a gas chromatography column.  The robot will wait until the selected sample is injected into the gas chromatograph and the analytical procedure completed.  The robot will then remove the sample vial from the injection station and return it to its place in the vial rack.  The robot will then move to the vial in the next position and repeat the procedure.  This procedure will be carried out for all samples in the analytical run.
3.	The robot will be engineered to work within the parameters of the existing system.  It will also be designed to handle the 16 x 100mm, 10-milliliter Vacutainer air sample vials currently in use in the Air Lab.

Timeline and Period of Performance

Vendors will submit bids and detailed proposals within the time frames stipulated by the Purchaser?s formal Request for Bid.  The selected vendor will provide delivery of the complete system within 12 to 16 weeks of receipt of the signed purchase order.  On-site installation and training will immediately follow the system delivery, within seven (7) days.

Vendor Responsibilities

1.	Assign a dedicated project manager (PM) to oversee the planning, manufacture, and installation of the robot.  The PM will work with laboratory personnel to plan, develop, and implement the robot.
2.	Attend a Project Initiation meeting and Final Review Meeting at the Purchaser?s facility in Mount Hope, West Virginia.
3.	Provide all project drawings and documentations to Purchaser three (3) working days prior to the Final Review Meeting.
4.	Provide all engineering, design, hardware, software, fabrication, and assembly of components of the system as described in the proposal.
5.	Package, prepare, and ship the system to the Purchaser?s facility in Mount Hope, West Virginia.
6.	Provide installation, startup, and acceptance testing supervision at Purchaser?s facility.
7.	Provide all related documentation and drawings, including operation and maintenance manuals, assembly drawings, materials lists, and system warranty information.
8.	Provide in-depth system training, including operation, programming, and maintenance.  System overview and programming training should be at the Vendor?s facility for at least two laboratory employees.  Specific system operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting training should take place at the Purchaser?s facility.
9.	Respond promptly to all problems or issues brought forth by the Purchaser regarding the system, within five (5) working days.

Purchaser?s Responsibilities

1.	Conduct Project Initiation and Final Review meetings at Purchaser?s facility in Mount Hope, West Virginia.
2.	Provide specification drawings and all components required for design and testing.
3.	Respond promptly to all project design drawings and documentation with any comments, within five (5) working days.
4.	Provide all utility and control access as specified in the site preparation drawings.
5.	Provide payment in accordance to the terms specified in the final Purchase Order.
6.	Reserves the right to terminate the contract if Vendor fails to deliver or fails to comply with the terms of this SOW or the terms of the Purchase Order.


Deliverables

All system components shall be packaged, prepared, and shipped to the Purchaser?s facility in Mount Hope, West Virginia by the Vendor.  Delivery shall be within 12-16 weeks of receipt of the signed purchase order.

Project Cost

The projected cost is only a government estimate.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) is posting this sources sought notice on behalf of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) prepares the Nation?s economic accounts, covering all sectors of the economy.  Data underlying the accounts vary in terms of quality and timeliness.  The state and local government sector depends heavily upon a set of annual surveys conducted by the Census Bureau.  While the surveys are comprehensive, detailed, and of high quality, they are not timely.  Generally, two years pass between the end of the reference year and completion of preliminary statistics.  Furthermore, the Census statistics are based on fiscal years, while BEA?s statistics are quarterly.  

BEA?s Strategic Plan for 2007 ? 2011 calls for continuous improvement of National Income and Product Account (NIPA) statistics.  A new source of real-time expenditure data for state and local governments would do much to improve the accounts.  Real-time expenditure surveys have been considered in the past, but they have never been attempted.  

Although one company has been identified, the objective of this sources sought notice is to identify other companies capable of collecting near real-time quarterly financial data on a nationwide basis at the state level in accordance with the mandatory technical requirements described below.

This market survey is being conducted through FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience, to gather current market information and to determine the availability and potential technical capability of businesses to provide these services.

BEA identified the following mandatory technical requirements for the acquisition of the pilot study to collect real-time expenditure statistics from selected local governments:

Task 1:	In collaboration BEA and with input from the Census Bureau?s Governments Division, continue collecting expenditure data from a sample of nine local governments and continue to develop/modify (as appropriate) the survey questions used to collect these expenditure data.  Ensure that the sample is designed so that the Governments Division can accelerate its independent collection of data from the selected local governments, and so that the data collected by the contractor and the Governments Division can be compared in a timely fashion.  The survey questions may be designed/modified to collect data on expenditures by function and by type or object classification.    

Task 2:	Conduct the survey on two occasions during or after fiscal year 2008 so as to capture total fiscal year spending for certain categories for the local governments in the sample; these data should be comparable to those collected by the Governments Division for fiscal year 2008.  

Task 3: 	Employ an effort-tracking system to capture information about the time, technological, and human resources required to conduct the survey from a support and follow-up services perspective.  Use the information on resource requirements to estimate the human, technological, and human requirements for conducting a similar survey should the survey be extended to collect national-level statistics on local government expenditures.  The latter should be performed under the assumption of both manual and automated data collection processes.  


SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES

The following schedule of deliverables is proposed:

1.	Continue the semi-annual surveys and provide a report on the statistical and effort tracking system results.  ? Six months after the contract is initiated.

2.	Modify the pilot study as required in response to the results obtained from the previous surveys.  ? Nine months after the contract is initiated.

3.	Conduct the final semi-annual surveys and provide a report on the statistical and effort tracking system results.  Also, provide a final summary report on the pilot study.  ? Twelve months after the contract is initiated.


PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA

The tasks completed under a contract that is based on this statement of work will be evaluated on the following criteria:  (1) The representativeness of the sample selected for the pilot study; (2) the survey?s functionality in collecting financial statistics on expenditures that are consistent with those collected by the Census Bureau?s Governments Division and in collecting data that BEA can use directly to prepare estimates of state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment for the NIPAs; (3) the comparability of the statistics collected through the pilot study and those collected by the Governments Division; (4) the reasonableness of the effort requirement estimates that are produced during the pilot study as assessed by data collection agencies such as BEA and the Governments Division.  

A fixed price, single award is anticipated, with an estimated performance period of one year.  

If your organization has the capacity to perform these services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., large business, small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; 2) Business size information which states, the business size, annual receipts (average gross revenue) for the last three (3) fiscal years, and whether or not the firm has been approved as a small business by the SBA under the applicable NAICS code; and 3) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort and any pertinent supporting documentation that clearly demonstrates the company?s ability to deliver these data sets according to the technical requirements described above.  Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.  

The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) documented evidence which clearly reflects their organizational experience in providing these data sets.  To be considered an affirmative response, the response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. Interest parties must address each of the mandatory data requirements listed in the Justification in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.     

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND ONE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  Again, this is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received in response to this notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Responding firms should provide one (1) electronic copy of a tailored capability statement by Thursday, September 06, 2007 via email to Sheila.Adjei@noaa.gov. Reference: ?BEA Financial Statistics - Sources Sought? in the subject line.

<SUBJECT>70 -- UPS  Power Supply
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

Joint Communications Support Element, Bldg 861, 8532 Marina Bay Drive, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5101, requires twenty-three (23) DRS Technologies model 1500TR-III-359 UPS systems. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to DRS Technologies, 4230 Lafayette Center Drive, Chantilly, Virginia 20151.  DRS Technologies is the manufacturer and sole proprietor of the 1500TR-III-359 system.  Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Monday, 3 Sep 07, 4:00 p.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Monday, 3 Sep 07, 4:00 p.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

DRS Universal Power Systems is the only company that produces the 1500TR-III-359.  The 1500TR-III-359 On-line UPS has characteristics and electrical specifications that MUST be met in order to fully safeguard and maintain continual classified uninterrupted operations of deployed mobile communication systems.  

The DRS Universal Power Systems model 1500TR-III-359 is a modified UPS system specifically designed to support the Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) deployed mobile communications commitment.  The -359 option adds a "Stand Alone Faceplate which allows the UPS to be used in a stand alone (out of rack) application.  From a previous purchase of the same item, we found that DRS Universal Power Systems model 1500TR-III-359 is the only system on the market that meets all electrical specifications and can handle 200 percent output rating for 8 seconds with a rear connection for additional battery packs.  The electrical specifications are: 
-	1500VA/1050W Global UPS
-	Automatic Input Voltage sensing: any source of input voltage between 92 to 254 Volts AC - world wide input voltage selection
-	Built-in input isolation transformer 
-	user-selectable output voltage 100/110/115/120/127 VAC
-	Auto input frequency Selection 40-70 Hz
-	User selectable output frequency 50-60 Hz
-	120VAC output voltage +_ 3%
-	No more than 5% THD full non-linear load
-	Auxiliary output receptacle NEMA 5-15R
-	Removable battery storage
-	Automatic bypass capability for servicing batteries
-	Rear connection for additional battery packs
-	Front Panel Indicator for battery conditions/status
-	7 min. battery reserve
-	NEMA 5-15P input power cable
-	Four NEMA 5-15R output receptacles
-	Handles 200% of output rating for 8 seconds.
-	Meets MIL-STD-167-1

The mobile communication system does not allow for an alternate back up power source.  If any other electrical configurations are used with the mobile communication system it would create fluctuation/variation in power voltage.  A fluctuation/variation in power voltage would within seconds damage over $9,000,000.00 worth of deployed mobile communication equipment and leave JCSE unable to provide uninterrupted communications to the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and war fighters, which would be catastrophic.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Promina Digital Support System
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) requires the continued maintenance support services of 20 Promina Digital Network Exchange Systems.  The maintenance support services includes access to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC), 24 hours a day / 7 days a week phone support, software upgrades, and next business day hardware replacement.  Promina Digital Network Exchange Systems are exclusively designed, developed, and fielded solely by Network Equipment Technologies (N.E.T.) Federal.  N.E.T. Federal is the only authorized distributor and CACI is the only authorized provider of the services required to support and maintain these systems.  Any interested parties may e-mail joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Joyce Wright, no later than Monday, 3 September 2007, 4:00 p.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V.  	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The Promina Digital Network Exchange Systems were purchased from N.E.T. Federal.  After systems were purchased N.E.T. Federal designed and configured a multi-service access platform to meet the specific needs of JCSE.  The configuration provides an adaptive and reliable foundation for building Wide Area Networks (WANs) and interfacing with other carrier services.  This allows for the consolidation of a variety of user traffic and applications on a single platform while supporting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Frame Relay, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and Internet Protocol (IP) Transport Techniques.  To purchase another system would mean forfeiting a system currently valued at $9M and absorbing the costs and efforts (i.e., new system cost, time to employ new system, training of personnel, etc.) involved in procuring and implementing another system.  It is not reasonable nor would it be cost effective to purchase another system when it too would require the same continued services.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

NOTE:  FAR Clause 52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds is in effect for this requirement. 

52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Governments obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>R -- Civil Engineering - Material Acquisitions Services Streamlined Competition Results
<DESC>STREAMLINED COMPETITION DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT  

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE MATERIAL ACQUISITION SERVICES 

The Civil Engineering Squadron, Lt Col Michael Roth, 30 CES/CEO has announced a performance decision of Material Acquisition Services.  Competition between agency tender and contract performance determined agency performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  This competition affects a total of 5 DoD personnel:  0 officers, 0 enlisted, 5 civilians, and 0 Contract Manpower Equivalents.  We anticipate no affect to these employees.

This streamlined competition was conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, that implements the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the Government's policy to rely on the private sector for commercial products and services.  When in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer, however, if contracting out is not more cost effective the service will stay in-house.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Embedded I-Dot Sensor for Measurement of the Dynamic Current Distribution within Transmission Line Structures
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Embedded I-Dot Sensor for Measurement of the Dynamic Current Distribution within Transmission Line Structures

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize its Embedded I-Dot technology for measuring dynamic current distribution in transmission line structures.

Background:  There are numerous methods to measure current in a circuit, including the use of current viewing resistors, Rogowski coils, and current transformers.  Current viewing resistors could be deemed too intrusive to make this type of measurement. Other I-dot or B-dot measurements measure the changing magnetic fields by either placing a loop(s) around one conductor in the circuit to measure a net current or measuring fringing fields. Neither of these measuring techniques provide information on the spatial distribution of the current.

Description:  LLNL?s Embedded I-Dot sensor technology is a probe designed to be embedded in a transmission line structure to measure dynamic current distribution in the transmission line structure.

Advantages:  Non-intrusive probe. Current can be calculated by integration. Spatially positioned to measure dynamic distribution of current for AC and transient pulses. High signal to noise ratio and high bandwidth.

Potential Applications:  Measuring current distributions in transmissions lines for optimization of Geometric Transmission Line Design. Measuring current distributions in power switching applications. Measuring current distribution within switch arrays. High bandwidth current measurements and high bandwidth dynamic current distribution.

Development Status:  LLNL is filing a patent application for this invention. A prototype has been developed and tests have been performed for proof of concept.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Embedded I-Dot technology for measuring dynamic current distribution in transmission line structures should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 152-07

Justification for Sole Source:  The Microsoft Campus Agreement is a 3-year program through Microsoft and its resellers that allows accredited academic institutions to take advantage of academic pricing.   DINFOS relies on the Microsoft suite of applications, server products, and operating systems both for staff and faculty daily operations, as well as, classroom instruction and student computer labs.  This Campus Agreement provides license coverage for 300 staff and up to 1200 student workstation loads for its core systems and applications.  This service is vital to the mission of DINFOS.  This proprietary, vendor-specific hardware/software is currently in operational use at DINFOS.   This is a 3-year lease agreement renewable yearly with CDW-G that was awarded the contract in FY2005 through competitive acquisition.  The process to initially establish the paperwork baseline required by Microsoft for this service was extensive.  The current documentation required by Microsoft to remain in the program resides with CDW-G.

<DESC>Solicitation number 2007-Q-10035 is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). RFQ 2007-Q-10035 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-4.  This procurement is not a small business set-aside.

One of the outcomes of the Futures Initiative was the decision to transform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into a performance-based agency whose budget is aligned with its goals for health protection. CDC's health protection goals are the basis for all of CDC?s priority decisions. 

A vital step in the reorganization is effectively communicating to CDC partners these health protection goals and strategic imperatives. The American Public Health Association's (APHA) annual conference and exposition draws most of CDC's strongest and most long-standing partners. Annual attendance is in the 10,000-13,000 range. APHA?s annual conference provides CDC with an opportunity to keep its partners and stakeholders informed of the goals process and gather feedback on CDC's direction.

In the past two years, CDC has presented a consolidated, "one agency presence" at APHA conferences. Prior to this, our representation was spread among the various CIOs. The consolidated display at the APHA annual conference allows CDC to present a unified visual representation of our direction, unity and purpose. 

The purpose of this procurement is to acquire the services of a vendor, who,as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, shall furnish all personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies and transportation necessary to erect /establish an exhibitor?s booth at the 2007 Annual Conference of the American Public Health Association (APHA), to be held 03-07 November 2007 in Washington, DC.  The contractor will have a management level person assisting on-site at the conference with technical issues and installation.  Specific tasks to be performed are as follows:(1)Provide layout consultation for entire exhibit area to include:four sections for the people,place, preparedness and global goals; recommendations on how best to position CDC's goals to APHA attendees;ten individual sections/stations for each Center/Institute/Organization (CIO), which must include at least eleven tables measuring at least eight-feet in length;two sections for information booths; two common areas for networking; which include at least four couches and a loveseat;incorporation of Vision Dome immersive display,which will be incorporated in the center of the exhibit. (2)Produce four new artwork panels, banner stands and additional artwork and signage as deemed necessary.(3)Attend / participate in a minimum of two meeting with CDC personnel in Atlanta, GA regarding the CDC's exhibit's presence at APHA.(4)Ship the existing hardware, new artwork and all exhibit materials including the Vision Dome) to the APHA conference location.(5)Provide four (4) laptop computers, each with internet connection.
(6)Renting and setting up additional equipment items for the e-health download stations and the new media marketing area (7)Contractor is responsible for the cost of CDC?s booth rental, shipping, labor and rental equipment costs, and all exhibit fees.  For more information on exhibit fees, please access APHA's website at www.apha.org.(8) Securing a hospitality suite through the hotel.

Inspect and tighten all fastenings on the main pier extending from boathouse platform (piling G in drawing, Fig. 2) to end of pier. Replace missing or damaged hardware with hot-dip galvanized steel material sized and configured to match existing adjacent hardware (assume 2% of the pier hardware will require replacement).  2. Conduct visual inspection of floating concrete docks and provide verbal report to POC. Contractor shall arrange for site access and sequencing of work by contacting Ben Haskell on (781) 545-8026 x207.  Drawing and Figure available by emailing request to Sabrina.tippins@noaa.gov.

5.4	Enhance GeoBase Desktop Toolkit (GDT) Application

Contractor shall enhance capabilities of existing GeoBase Desktop Toolkit (GDT).  This application shall include all existing functionality of GDT (zoom in/zoom out, identify, measure, modify features, etc.) plus enhancements.  Contractor shall upgrade application within the current ESRI ArcGIS Engine (version 9.2) development environment, meaning users will require only an ArcGIS Engine runtime license in order to install and run GDT.  Contractor shall work with HQ ACC staff to ensure application has the desired interface (i.e. look and feel like an ESRI ArcGIS tool).

5.5	Application Code Cleanup

Existing application code needs to be cleaned up to facilitate easier bug fixes and upgrades. Application code shall be refactored using standard programming practices.

5.6	Data Display

Contractor shall enhance GeoBase Desktop Toolkit?s GIS data display capabilities.
5.6.1	Source Tab ? Add a Source Tab in the table of contents that displays location (path) of data in map.
5.6.2	Layer Symbology ? Give users more symbology choices. Add ability to change sizes and colors of symbols, and to use graduated points, different linetypes, markers, polygon hatching, etc. Add ability to add in different ESRI style set (.style) files.
5.6.3	Scale Box ? Add box to existing toolbar that shows current map scale, allows user to enter in a scale (and hit Enter and zoom to that scale), and contains a dropdown for choosing some common scales such as 1:100,  1:1000, 1:250,000, etc. Desired functionality is the same that currently exists in ESRI ArcMap.  
5.6.4	Coordinates ? Add box to existing toolbar that displays scrolling coordinates of current position on the map of the mouse pointer/selection tool/draw tool. Coordinates should be displayed in the coordinate system of the data frame.
5.6.5	Map Units ? Add Nautical Miles to choice of available map units, especially in the Layout View. Nautical Miles are critical for USAF operations maps and charts used by pilots.
5.6.6	Map Export ? Current application has no map export capability.  Contractor shall enhance GDT so user can export data frame and layout views (created maps) to JPEG, PDF, Bitmap, TIFF, and GIF formats. 
5.6.7	Layout View Legend ? Legend in layout view cannot be manipulated. Give user more choices to modify and customize the layout view?s legend similar to ESRI ArcMap functionality.


5.7	Data Properties

Contractor shall enhance GeoBase Desktop Toolkit?s GIS data property capabilities.
5.7.1	Expand Data Source Options ? Allow user to pull in data from SDE and ArcIMS services.
5.7.2	Layer Properties ? Add a mechanism for determining layer properties, specifically which fields comprise a layer?s attribute data, and information about those fields including type, length, alias, and number format. 
5.7.3	Data Frame Properties ? Add a dialog box (accessible via right-click inside data frame) that shows data frame properties and allows user to change projection, display units, and choose between automatic scale, fixed scale, or fixed extent.
5.7.4	Coordinate Tool ? Create a tool with 2 functions:
1.	enable a user to click on the map and see coordinates for that location displayed in Lat/Lon (user set choice of DD or DMS.ss), UTM, MGRS, and (if applicable) the data?s native coordinate system (i.e. State Plane, USNG, etc.).
2.	Allow user to type in coordinates (with Lat/Lon, UTM, MGRS, or native coordinate system chosen from a dropdown) and have map frame center on that position, i.e. ?zoom to coordinates? functionality.


5.8	Data Editing

Contractor shall enhance GeoBase Desktop Toolkit?s GIS data editing capabilities.
5.8.1	Edit Tool ? Improve edit tool so that it has functionality similar to edit tool in ArcMap.  Specifically, allow user to modify and delete features using edit tool.
5.8.2	Edit Data in Different Coordinate Systems ? Current application does not allow user to edit data in different coordinate systems within one map project (.mxd). Contractor shall enhance GDT to allow users to edit data with different coordinate systems in the same map project data frame.
5.8.3	Connect to SDE Data and Edit in a Versioned Environment ? GDT shall be upgraded to allow users to connect to versions of an enterprise geodatabase (ESRI ArcSDE) and edit data within those versions. 
5.8.4	Selection Tools ? Current selection methods are inadequate and shall be improved to have similar functionality as selection tools in ArcMap.  Specifically, allow user to right click on feature in table of contents and choose select all, clear selected features, and switch selection. Current Select All tool does not seem to be functional.
5.8.5	Attribute Selection ? Enable selected map feature(s) to be highlighted in the attribute table, and features corresponding to selected attribute record(s) to be highlighted in the map data frame.
5.8.6	Add X,Y Table ? Enable other data formats to be imported for x,y tables. Specifically user shall be able to import x,y tables in .dbf, .xls. Dbase, and tab delimited formats.
5.8.7	Export Data ? Contractor shall enhance GDT so user can export GIS data (either all or selected features) to shapefile and geodatabase feature class formats. 


5.9	GDT User Help

Contractor shall upgrade User Help contents to describe the functionality of each tool and document the added enhancements and changes to GDT application. 


5.10	Application Configuration and Testing

Contractor shall install, configure, and test application at HQ ACC server to meet HQ ACC GeoBase GDT enhancement requirements.  Contractor shall ensure that application runs properly on the HQ ACC and Air Force GCSS portal enterprises.

I.  REQUIREMENT:

The Contractor shall provide the following items as specified as the requirement is Brand Name only.  The 112th Signal Battalion requires purchasing four (4) each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (shelter) model number AC1209L, four each L-band fiber optic transceiver systems (remote) AC1209L-R and eight each fiber optic jumper cables J-Im4-TFOCA2-FC/APC.  The fiber modems are used to extend the RF capability in order to support Phoenix satellite terminals and baseband communications equipment for the Battalion. Currently the 112th are using two sets of these models for fiber modems to provide services in the CENTCOM AOR.  Four (4) more of these sets are needed and it is needed as well that they are compatible with the set presently in use in order for the Phoenix systems can be operated  remotely and TDMA signals sent without changing any protocols or dropping the shot.  This will also cause less down time to troubleshoot a component that is not compatible with our existing architecture.  The modems required must also meet the following specifications:

?	The RF path must have transmit and receive isolation on the link
?	The modem must have an Ethernet interface using a single fiber strand.
?	The modem set will need to be furnished with a 1000M 4 channel single mode fiber reel with TFOCA II ends.  This will also require a 2 ea TFOCA II fan-out per modem set (2 meters long) with FC ends on the fan-out ends.
?	The modem must have LED status indicators for both the optics side of the links as well as the RF and Ethernet side of the links.
?	The modem must have an LED status indicator for power state.
?	The modem must be matched to 75 Ohm impedance.
?	RF Link gain must be between -2dBm to +2dBm
?	Modem optical interfaces must be SM FC/APC
?	Modem RF interfaces must be N type
?	Ethernet interface must be 8x8 Rj45
?	Link will be modeled for 1--- meters
?	The input to the optical transmitter must be capable of withstanding signal levels of -40 to 0dBm(+10dBm as absolute maximum) (RF Uplink)
?	RF Downlink maximum RF input to fiber optic transmitter is less than 0dBm.
?	Modems must operate in temperatures of -30 Degrees C to 75 Degrees C.
?	Modems will be designed to fit in standard 19 inch rack mounts, with front and rear supports.

Along with the material support of acquiring the modems the 112th requires technical support in order to ensure that this equipment is compatible with our Phoenix Satellite Communications Systems:

Pre-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the installation location, 112th Signal Battalion, Fort Bragg, NC and meet with the 112th engineers to determine specific engineering and functionality requirements of the Fiber to RF modems.   Tasks would include pre-engineering design discussions and assessment of required RF component interfaces.  This work should be accomplished in 24 work hours.

Post-Engineering Support:  Vendor will be required to visit the same installation site and assist with the initial installation of equipment.  Tasks would include fault discovery and troubleshooting, product acceptance testing and delivery acceptance testing, initial item training and familiarization, and engineering recommendations for product improvement.  This will be considered complete when the 112th engineers are able to remote the modems from the terminal and see no degradation of RF performance.  This work shall as well be accomplished in 24 work hours.  The installation, testing and training shall take place at the 112th Signal Battalion motor pool area (Building E-4166).  The hours of operation will be during the regular duty hours of 0900 ? 1700.

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire a Program Manager to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities.  The Program Manager will assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.  OTI currently has three regional teams: Asia and Near East (ANE), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide additional PSC staff to provide program management functions for OTI's regional program teams.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Program Manager must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and a well-developed understanding of US policy interests. The successful candidate must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc) to help ensure programmatic success.
The Program Manager will be based in Washington, D.C. and will be a member of one of DCHA/OTI's regional teams responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  The incumbent will report to and be supervised by one of the Regional Team Leaders.  The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

GS-12 - Duties and Responsibilities.
* Implement and manage assigned country programs, including the work of contractors and grantees working under country programs, and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for up to one month or more if required;
* Initiate and manage the preparation of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;
* Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;
* Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;

* Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;
* Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;
* Participate in the design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues; 
* When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;
* When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example;
* Mentor/train other OTI program managers as required; and,
* Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

 SCOPE OF WORK:   

The Contractor shall provide a trawl vessel with the equipment identified elsewhere in this document; captain and crew; fuel; food and berthing accommodations equal to that of the crew for up to two NOAA Fisheries gear specialists; and all other material necessary to complete the work identified below.

BACKGROUND:
1.   Flynet trawls are currently exempt from turtle excluder device (TED) regulations.   NOAA Fisheries is considering the implementation of TED regulations for the flynet fishery, pending the development of practical and efficient TEDs for these large trawls.   The NOAA Fisheries Harvesting Systems Team has worked cooperatively with several North Carolina flynet fishermen to develop a working TED and to assess the effect which TEDs may have on the target catch. However, quantifying catch loss for the various TED prototypes developed for this fishery has proven difficult.  

2.   Vessels that participate in this fishery are rigged to tow a single net.  This feature combined with a fishing technique that targets individual dense schools of fish results in highly variable catch rates and poses a problem when it comes to traditional gear evaluations designed to determine the amount of catch loss associated with TED use.  The traditional method used with vessels rigged to tow single trawls is the alternate haul method and would consist of alternating tows with and without a TED installed.  Sample size calculations based on observed catch variability for this fishery and the alternate haul experimental design projected that between 720 and 2,184 total tows would be needed to effectively test a single TED.  Based on the sample size calculation and projected costs, it is clear that this technique is not cost effective for this fishery.  

3.   A better alternative is the ?trouser trawl? technique, which consists of a standard trawl modified with two codends and dividing panel that runs the length of the trawl body.  The advantage of this technique is that it takes simultaneous samples in each codend resulting in lower variability between control and experimental catches producing a cost effective technique that requires fewer tows to detect significant differences between treatments. The Harvesting Systems Team has purchased a standard 85 ft flynet and recently applied a trouser trawl modification with a vertical dividing panel.  The trawl was modified and inspected by the Team?s Fisheries Methods and Equipment Specialist staff and has been recommended for commercial evaluations.

4.   The proposed work will assess the use of the flynet trouser trawl as an effective comparative towing technique for the flynet fishery.  In addition, the work will determine the amount of catch loss associated with TED use in this fishery and operational feasibility of each TED design.  The trouser trawl and TED assessment will be completed through the charter of a commercial flynet trawl vessels.  The proposed charter will be conducted on traditional flynet fishing grounds along the North Carolina coast during the flynet fishing season, which typically occurs between October and March.  The chartered vessels shall notify NOAA Fisheries staff regarding target catch availability, weather and vessel dates of availability during this time period.  NOAA Fisheries staff will coordinate sailing schedules among vessels to prevent conflicts and ensure all work can be completed during the time period.  The chartered vessels shall be used to evaluate the trouser trawl as an effective comparative towing technique and to determine target catch loss associated with TED use in this fishery.  The work shall be conducted in two phases:  

?	Phase I	Comparative towing with a flynet trouser trawl to determine catch loss 	associated with three TED prototypes.
?	Phase II	Determine the operational feasibility of prototype TEDs

Phase I of the study shall last for a period of 15 working days. Using the chartered vessels as a platform, the gear modifications will be evaluated by NOAA Fisheries gear specialists.  Phase II of the study shall last for a period of nine (9) working days.  Using the chartered vessels as a platform, prototype TEDs will be evaluated by NOAA Fisheries gear specialists and certified observers. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  
The work described herein shall be performed in two phases.  Phase I shall be completed during 15 days between October 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008.  Phase II shall be completed during nine (9) days between October 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008.

Description of Work:

Phase I   October 1, 2007-March 31, 2008

The Contractor shall notify NOAA Fisheries staff of vessel availability dates based on target catch availability and weather.  Once notified, NOAA Fisheries gear specialists will travel to the vessel and meet with the captain to go over gear testing protocols, load equipment, TEDs and install the flynet trouser trawl.   When weather permits, the Contractor shall depart for the fishing grounds (up to 8 hour run).  Individual vessels trips shall be up to three days in length.  

Once the vessel arrives on the fishing grounds, the captain shall begin towing and shall continue around the clock for up to three days or until contract days are complete.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quotation has been determined acceptable ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price. 

1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the Halon Recovery Systems in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any ?significant problems? encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer?s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.			

4. Complete the following Certifications and/or ORCA

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is September 6, 2007 ? 2:00PM local time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.  FAR Subpart 13.5 procedures are being utilized.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for training of NIST staff and foreign NIST Associates on-site at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland and in Boulder, Colorado to explain U.S. Federal and State tax regulations as they apply to foreign NIST Associates and as they relate to their respective countries, including those with which the U.S. has tax treaties.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

Statement of Work (SOW)

Background:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) like many other Federal research and development organizations, hosts hundreds (currently 731) of Foreign Guest Researchers (FGR) each year to collaborate with NIST scientists in their research work.  Their collaboration contributes significantly to the research ongoing at NIST, and thus, to the NIST mission accomplishment.  Tax treaties and the tax rules that apply to foreign nationals is a very complicated area of the U.S. and State tax laws.  The NIST accounting staff has no expertise in the many different tax treaties that apply to FGRs home countries.  FGRs represent at least 65 to 75 different countries during the course of the tax year with various lengths of stay.

Objective:  NIST requires training services from a contractor with expertise in foreign tax treaties, as they apply to NIST Foreign Guest Researchers.  This training service is a benefit to NIST in attracting world-class guest researchers, and in assisting NIST with the administrative requirements of obtaining the services of guest researchers.

Purpose:  The Contractor shall train NIST staff and foreign guest researchers on U.S. tax liabilities and obligations for subsistence allowances paid to foreign guest researchers.  

Contractor Requirements:  The contractor shall provide training to NIST staff and foreign guest researchers on-site at NIST to explain U.S. Federal and State tax regulations as they apply and as they relate to the respective countries with which the U.S. has tax treaties.  The contractor shall train NIST staff and foreign guest researchers on-site about U.S. tax liabilities and obligations for subsistence allowances paid to guest researchers by NIST which shall include the following:

1.	Provide to the COTR one reproducible copy of a written hand booklet explaining U.S. Federal and State tax regulations for NIST Gaithersburg, MD foreign guest researchers and NIST staff, to include tax information for both resident and non-resident aliens.  The contractor shall update the hand booklet as necessary throughout the year.

2.	Update the above hand booklet (in 1. above) for NIST Boulder, CO Foreign Guest Researchers and Boulder NIST staff to include Colorado State specific information.

3.	Provide training and written descriptive materials interpreting tax regulations for NIST foreign guest researchers and NIST staff (Gaithersburg and Boulder), regarding tax obligations and liabilities for resident and non-resident aliens, including providing instructions on completing IRS Form W-8-BEN and determining what treaty benefits apply to foreign guest researchers.

4.	Prepare and present an annual one-half day seminar for non-resident aliens and NIST staff at NIST Gaithersburg on tax liabilities and preparation.  

5.	Prepare and present an annual one-half day training seminar for resident aliens and NIST staff at NIST Gaithersburg on tax liabilities and preparation.

6.	Prepare and present an annual one-half day training seminar for non-resident aliens and NIST staff at NIST Boulder on tax liabilities and preparation.

7.	Prepare and present an annual one-half day training seminar for resident aliens and NIST staff at NIST Boulder on tax liabilities and preparation.

8.	Costs for airfare and costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of the travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations prescribed by the General Services Administration.

The contract line items for this solicitation are:

CLIN 0001:  Contractor performance of SOW requirements; Quantity:  Not to Exceed 289; Unit:  Hours.

CLIN 0002:  Other Direct Costs including Travel.  Contractor travel costs to be reimbursed in accordance with FAR 31.205-46.  Quantity:  1; Unit:  Lot

The resulting contract will be awarded on a time-and-materials basis and the Government will pay for only the hours expended providing the services.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 03 - THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY OFFERORS.

1.	Question:  Do you have a list of interested vendors for this solicitation that you could provide to me?

Response:  Please refer to www.fbo.gov there is an Interested Vendors List (IVL) active for this procurement.

2.	Question:  I am interested in learning, is there an incumbent contractor for this requirement?  Or is this a new requirement that the NRC is looking to procure?  

Response:  There is not an incumbent contractor for this requirement.  Yes, this is a new requirement that NRC is procuring.

3.	Question:  Can the NRC provide the terminal course objective?  Would the following objective be accurate?

"Upon completion of the course the student will be able to: articulate the design basis purpose of each major system comprising a (reactor type here) reactor, and state the regulatory documents that provide the criteria for validating that the system design meets that purpose."

Response:  The above state of objective is incomplete.  A more complete statement can be developed from section 3.1 of the statement of objectives.   The statement that was provided (above) is clearly missing section 3.1 (v) and (vi) and appears to cover part of section 3.1 (i) and (ii).

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 04 - THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY OFFERORS.

1.	Question:  For the training outline provided the technical specifications refer Condition I, II, III and IV events. The following is provided as requested:  I'm not familiar with the "Condition I, II, III, IV" terminology. However, I suspect it relates to the following event classifications which are "defined" in subsection 15A.2.2 of the NSOA for the ABWR (see attached ABWR DCD/Tier 2, Appendix 15A):

(a) Normal (Planned) Operations
(b) Moderate Frequency Incidents (Anticipated (Expected) Operational Transients)
(c) Infrequent Incidents (Abnormal (Unexpected) Operational Transients)
(d) Limiting Faults (Design Basis (Postulated) Accidents)
(e) Special (Hypothetical) Events

Specific events in each of these classes are identified in tables 15A-8 thru -12.

I recommend that you the NRC contact to clarify their expectations for that subtopic.

Response:  NRC Regulatory Guide 1.70 Revision 3 address these as initiating events (for example see section 15.x.x. Event Evaluation; where these are listed as (a) Incidents of moderate frequency, (b) Infrequent incidents, and (c) limiting faults). American National Standard N18.2-1973 section 2.1 provide definitions of Condition I: Normal Operations, Condition II: incidents of Moderate Frequency, Condition III: Infrequent Incidents, and Condition IV: Limiting Faults and gives more specific details. ANSI/ANS-51.1-1983 categorizing schemes is based on frequency of occurrence and use Plant Condition PC1 through PC5. Terminology used in NRC certified Design Control Document (DCD) will be acceptable.

2.  Question: Is there any way to request an extension of the submittal deadline?

Response:  The close date for this combined synopsis/solicitation is extended from September 10, 2007 to September 13, 2007 by 12:00 noon (local time).  The hard copies are due on September 14, 2007 by 1:00 p.m.

To date, the Department maintains over 220 million dollars worth of radio communications equipment worldwide. To maintain this equipment, a procurement vehicle has been in place to cover the need to purchase parts and life cycle replacement radios.     	This procurement vehicle, an IDIQ contract SLMAQM 01 D 0013 with Motorola Corporation has exercised its last option year, and a new refresh contract is in negotiations between Motorola and Department of State. The life cycle for the deployed radio system has four more years in which operations and maintenance are required to continue. 	The justification for sole sourcing with Motorola Corporation is due to the Motorola proprietary embedded signal algorithms essential to the compatibility of the network.  In addition, the Federal Flash algorithm which allow the federal government to deploy the zoned radios globally. Without it a radio can not access these networks and communicate emergency instructions.  This is the MDC1200 signaling algorithm. 	The Radio Programs Branch relies on Motorola equipment to meet the requirements of the O&M phase now in existence.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial items listed below and prepared in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation number, DOL072J10045 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are incorporated through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541511.The Department of Labor?s Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index (PPI) is seeking a contractor to provide data and services to aid in constructing an output price index for new warehouse construction in the United States. The data will be used to determine high level specifications for the models and as a frame source for survey respondents. Services will include the development of four detailed regional warehouse models.  The contract length will be two years. If your company is interested in this requirement, contact Vanessa Reynolds for a Statement of Work at reynolds.vanessa@bls.gov. Please submit a technical and cost proposal no later than August 24, 2007, at 3:00PM ET .  Questions should be submitted to the same email address and must be received no later than August 9, 2007 at 3:00PM ET.  The Technical Proposal should not exceed 40 pages, plus resumes and attachments.  All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria.  The BLS will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer to this solicitation is the most advantageous to the Government.  The anticipated award date is September 14, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be evaluated by BLS. Technical Proposals must contain the following information:

1.  Name of: (a) project leader (b) person(s) directly responsible for model development, (c) person(s) responsible for completing quarterly cost updates, and (d) person(s) directly responsible for answering questions.

2.  A description of the source data to be used to satisfy deliverable 1 as shown in the Statement of Work.  The description should include where and how the information is collected, the frequency of collection, and the scope.  The description should also state how the data are verified.

3.  The number of records that would be provided to BLS to satisfy deliverable 1.

4.  A complete listing of the individual fields (which make up a single record) that the offeror is able to provide information for to satisfy deliverable 1.

5.  An example of 20 project records in the vendor?s database that would be used to satisfy deliverable 1.  This should be provided in a Microsoft Excel format with each row being a single project record.

6.  A list of any additional fields not specifically requested by BLS for deliverable 1 but which the offeror believes might be important to include in each project record.  

7.  A description of the proposed methodology to be used by the offeror to select specific assemblies/components not imposed by BLS for inclusion and which represent current ?typical? construction practices.

8.  A description of the origin and scope of all primary and secondary source data that will be used to satisfy deliverable number 5 (cost updates) as stated in the Statement of Work.  Primary data sources are those directly surveyed by the vendor.  Secondary data sources are those surveyed by anyone other than the vendor.  If no secondary sources of data are used please state that explicitly.  Information must include: the total number of discrete materials for which costs are directly collected in the vendor?s cost surveys, the number of survey respondents participating in the vendor?s survey, the frequency of survey respondent contacts, and the average number of survey respondents per state.  The description should also state how the data are verified, validated, and, if applicable, modified.

9.  A description of how data in the offeror?s cost surveys are gathered and verified.

10.  A description of the proposed methodology to update the model costs on a quarterly basis.  The proposal should explain in detail how the update process would occur and describe the basis for updating the costs.  If both primary and secondary source data are to be utilized explain any differences between how each is used.  If there is no difference then state that explicitly.  The description must explain how the costs will be regionalized.

11.  A description of how the percentage changes between cost updates for individual assemblies and the building as a whole are expected to compare against secondary sources of price movement for the same time period.  For example, a description might state, ?The percentage change from one cost update to the next for each assembly is expected to very similar to the movement seen in secondary source data.?  Another example might be, ?The percentage change from one cost update to the next will exhibit a lag when compared to secondary sources due to the cost data from our survey respondents being reported on a 2-month lag.?

12.  Since the cost updates are intended to accurately reflect current market material, labor, and equipment price trends for the assemblies and the building as a whole, provide a summary narrative explaining why the proposed cost update methodology is the best method to capture this.

Offeror?s must provide three Past Performance references.  Please include Contract Number, technical and contracting points-of-contact including phone numbers and email addresses.  Past performance references should be similar in nature within the last five years.
 BLS will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria:

?	Scope and completeness of available project data to satisfy deliverable 1.
?	Clear and objective methodology for detailing warehouse models.
?	Proposed cost update methodology reflects actual cost changes observed in the market place.
?	Scope of survey used to gather current cost data.
?	Past Performance
?	Cost

<DESC>This amendment number two provides QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES

Proposals are due no later than 9:00 a.m. on September 4, 2007

0 - QUESTON:  What is the Contracting Officer?s e-mail address?  RESPONSE:  CLEMENTINE.CAUDLE-WR@DOT.GOV

1 - QUESTION:  Can you provide an indication as to its expected budget, budget range, total level of effort (hours) or estimated level of effort by Task?  RESPONSE:  THE GOVERNMENT HAS A $1.2 MILLION BUDGET FOR THIS STUDY.    

2 - QUESTION:  Are there any explicit instructions regarding the detail required and the formatting of the Cost Proposal?  RESPONSE:   WHEREAS THE CONTRACTOR IS EXPECTED TO PROPOSE ITS COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD COMMERCIAL PRACTICE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD, THE COST PROPOSAL SHOULD FURTHER DEFINE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPOSED SKILL MIX THAT THE CONTRACTOR CONSIDERS NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROJECT.   THE PROPOSED COSTS SHOULD BE FURTHER ALLOCATED AMONG THE VARIOUS TASKS AND FULLY DETAILED AS TO WHY THE ALLOCATION WOULD BEST ADDRESS THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENTS.  THE SPECIFIC COSTS PER TASK AS DERIVED FROM THE PROPOSED NUMBER OF HOURS AND HOURLY RATES ARE TO BE USED TO MEASURE THE EFFORT THE CONTRACTOR PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE TO EACH TASK.  

3 - QUESTION:  The press is reporting that the STB wants its prospective contractor to have ?no ties to the railroad industry.?  That is not the same standard described at 4.1.6 wherein ?the PM nor the Key Personnel will be subject to a conflicts screening ? must demonstrate that do not have an interest that would bias the results of the study.? Which is it?   RESPONSE:  THE STANDARD DESCRIBED AT 4.1.6 IS REQUIRED AS THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY WANT PEOPLE WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO INSURE THAT THE SUBMITTED REPORT IS NOT TAINTED BY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  AT MINIMUM, A FIRM CAN SHOW THAT IT HAS RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT DEPEND INORDINATELY ON FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ONE STAKEHOLDER INTEREST. 

4 - QUESTION:  Is there any way that the deadline can be extended even three business days to increase the chances that your client receives at least one, responsive proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE IS MODIFIED TO SEPTEMBER 4, 2007.
 
5 - QUESTION:  A 25 percent hold back is by far the most exorbitant.  Will the Government consider reducing that amount to a more conventional 10 percent?   RESPONSE:  AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH, THE GOVERNMENT AGREES TO REDUCE THE HOLD BACK TO TEN PERCENT.   
  
6 - QUESTION:  Other than the ?Combine Synopsis/Solicitation? and the ?Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation? post on August 13, 2007 on the Federal Business Opportunities web site, is there any other version of this request for proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE LINK IS AT HTTP://WWW.STB.DOT.GOV, SEE "ITEMS OF INTEREST" AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AUGUST 24, 2007.

7 - QUESTION:  In the six page document on page 2 of 6 it states:  ?The Contractor shall offer pricing for each of the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) and corresponding Tasks:?   Should this response be included as part of the technical proposal or submitted as a separate cost proposal?  RESPONSE:  THE CLIN AND CORRESPONDING TASKS SHALL BE INCLUDED SOLELY WITH THE COST PROPOSAL.

8 - QUESTION:  The CLIN task list on page 2 of 6 of the six page document does not match up exactly with the task list in Section 4 on pp. 4-5 of 10 of the ten page document. Should the CLIN task list be adapted to match the task list in the Technical Proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE CLIN TASK LIST SHOULD MATCH THE TASK LIST OF THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.  End of Amendment number 2.

CLOSING DATE: September  6, 2007, 5:00 p.m. EDT

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Program Manager (GS-12) in Washington, DC.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide the attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.

QUESTION:  When our scientist ran sample B, they noticed the bright white images indicated in the spectra.  Our assumption is this is just dust particles but wanted to know if the customer could verify the cleanliness of the samples?

RESPONSE:  These samples have been prepared in a clean room environment but no special treatments were performed to remove surface contamination.  Residual "white spots" seen in images may be due to contaminants.  In the case of contamination, images will be evaluted based on the background regions in the areas between the contaminants.

<CONTACT>DANIEL HERRING, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 717-770-6030, Fax 717-770-5689, Email daniel.herring@dla.mil
<DESC>DDC has received the following questions from contractors concerning the requirement for Audio-Visual Teleconference systems at DDAA.  Answers to these questions are included below.  

The Scope of Work will be revised, and will be issued via a separate Amendment to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Contractors must refer to the amended Scope of Work for changes to the requirement, and must provide quotes based upon the amended Scope of Work.

The period to schedule site visits is extended to August 29, 2007, and the closing date for receipt of proposals is extended to September 5, 2007.


Contractor No. 1:
DDAA Commanders Conference Room
1. Does the VTC need to have multipoint capabilities? If so, how many locations?

No. 

2. Will the VTC need to have ISDN capability at time of installation or will the standard IP interface be utilized and ISDN is to be an option for the future if needed?

It will need ISDN connectivity initially, but we would like to be able to connect it to an IP connection in the future.  Currently the room has one ISDN line, but will have two or three ISDN lines at the time the work is performed. VTC equipment should be ready to accept up to three ISDN lines at time of installation.

3. Does the VTC need to be High Definition quality at time of installation and subsequently the camera? If not do you want the option to unlock that feature in the future on the CODEC?

No. Neither device needs to be High Definition quality at this time, but it would be good if the CODEC has the capability to provide High Definition quality in the future.  The Scope of Work will be revised to request that contractors quote a High Definition VTC and camera as an option. 

4. Would you like to have the VTC capable of sharing presentation and source content during the meetings? This is called People+Content.

Yes. The Scope of Work will be revised to add this feature to the RFQ for the Commanders Conference Room only.

5. Is there a preferred location for the guest laptop connection such as the table or a wall plate? Will you want a network connection available at this input as well?

The laptop connection should be able to reach the middle of the table on the side closest to the projection screen. We need to be able to coil the cable up behind the armoire out of sight when not needed.  A network connection would be desirable.

6. Do the microphones need to pickup the peripheral seating locations or just the primary table attendees? Is there a preference between table boundary microphones or ceiling mounted?

The microphones need to pick up the primary table attendees. Table microphones (with mute buttons) are acceptable. If ceiling mounted microphones are used, there needs to be some means of muting / un-muting the microphones easily.

7. Is there 19? rack rail installed in the armoire for required AV equipment? If not is there room to install a 19? rack rail frame for same purpose?

No, a rack is not currently installed in the Armoire. It is large enough to accommodate a rack rail frame. 

8. Regarding the control system touch panel:
a. Is there a size requested?

A small LCD touch panel 7 ? 8.5 inches (diagonally) is sufficient.  The control panel will normally be located at the Armoire, but should be movable. Some means of operating the VTC, microphones, and camera from the table should be provided.  The Scope of Work will be revised to address this.


b. Will you need video preview capabilities on the panel for ?far side? VTC viewing?

No, not on the touch panel.


Contractor No. 1:
DDAA Training Room
1. Questions 1-5 from above apply for this room as well?
1. Does the VTC need to have multipoint capabilities? If so, how many locations?

No.

2. Will the VTC need to have ISDN capability at time of installation or will the standard IP interface be utilized and ISDN is to be an option for the future if needed?

It will need ISDN connectivity initially, but we would like to be able to connect it to an IP connection in the future.  VTC equipment should be ready to accept up to three ISDN lines without requiring additional equipment, though the room will have one ISDN line at the time the work is performed.

3. Does the VTC need to be High Definition quality at time of installation and subsequently the camera? If not do you want the option to unlock that feature in the future on the CODEC?

	No. Neither device needs to be High Definition quality at this time, but it would be good if the CODEC has the capability to provide High Definition quality in the future.  The Scope of Work will be revised to request that contractors quote a High Definition VTC and camera as an option. 

4. Would you like to have the VTC capable of sharing presentation and source content during the meetings? This is called People+Content.

No. This feature is not necessary for the training room. 

5. Is there a preferred location for the guest laptop connection such as the table or a wall plate? Will you want a network connection available at this input as well?

The laptop connection should be on the lectern. A network connection is desired.


2. Will the control system touch panel location be at the lectern or is a wireless unit to ?float? with the presenter a better option for you? 

A small LCD touch panel 7 ? 8.5 inches (diagonally) is sufficient. The control panel will be located at the lectern.  Some means of operating the VTC, microphones, and camera from a chair on the front row should be provided.  The Scope of Work will be revised to address this.

Will video preview be required / desired for ?far side? VTC viewing?

No, not on the touch panel.


3. Will the presenter typically be located at the lectern and necessitate a lectern mounted microphone?

No.  The room is small enough that a microphone is not necessary. Also, on-site instructors often move away from the lectern, especially if they are using the whiteboard.

Contractor No. 2:

1. When the describing the new VTC, it is unclear whether you expect one or two cameras?  

One camera per room is sufficient.  The Scope of Work will be revised to address this.

2. Do you need IP only or IP and ISDN?  
	Both IP and ISDN.  See questions and answer for contractor no. 1 for details.

3. Do you need secure VTC capability?
	No. 

4. When you describe microphones "must provide sufficient coverage for the entire conference room for video teleconferences and local presentations" do you mean desktop, wireless, or ceiling microphones?  How many?

For the Commander?s conference room, tabletop microphones should be sufficient. The table is approximately 6 x 9 ft, and the microphones need to pick up the primary table attendees.  

For the Training room, there are three rows of tables (four tables per row), so either ceiling or tabletop would be sufficient. This room primary function is classroom training, not VTC?s, so we don?t need a microphone on every desk. 

The Scope of Work will be revised to address these.
