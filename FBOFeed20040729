<DESC>Sole Source Contract Modification.  This is notice of the United States Army Yuma Proving Grounds (USAYPG) intent to negotiate a contract modification on a sole source basis with Copestone Resources LLC., 2318 Madelyn Circle, Tucson, AZ 85712 under e xisting contract number DATM07-02-C-0033.  Contract DATM07-02-C-0033  currently provides for research, development, deployment, software, documentation, testing and support for the Developmental Test Command, (DTC) Virtual Proving Ground, (VPG) effort, commonly known as the Integrated Test Management Framework (ITMF).  Work to date under the contract has provided the initial stages of a functioning ITMF software system that is now in the latter stages of development and must be continued by Copestone to avoid a substantial duplication of cost and time.  The anticipated modifi cation is a 9 month extension to the existing effort for continuation of the required support and will be focused on the DTCs requirement to interconnect multiple installations.  While the coding, programs and related equipment developed to date are govern ment assets, they are in an incomplete state of development and much of the knowledge, relative to the development of this software, resides within the personnel of  Copestone Resources LLC.  The NAICS code of 541511 with a size standard of $21 million app lies to the anticipated action.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Energy intends on awarding a sole source contract to the National Institute of Building Services (NIBS).  Congress chartered NIBS in 1974.  The sole source justification is based on one responsible source under FAR 6.301-1. NIBS has a proprietary software program called "Whole Building Design Guide" and "Construction Criteria Base".  The DOE is acquiring access to the "Whole Building Design Guide" and "Construction Criteria Base". No other organization has the "Whole Building Design Guide" and "Construction Criteria Base". NIBS created the CCB, which provides a complete collection of project planning, design, and construction documents from all Federal agencies.  The resulting "library" contains thousands of documents, and allows word/phase searches to quickly compile the Government?s documented knowledge on a subject. Although the CCB makes available virtually all Government issued property development/delivery/management documents, there are thousands of related documents that are not included, such as industry standards/guidelines, code references, research findings, guide specifications, and manufacturer?s data. Currently, the only means of linking both Federal and Private Sector property development information is through the WBDG website, also owned and maintained by NIBS. Interested firms, who may want to challenge the sole source to the NIBS, must do so by providing detailed information and pricing to Mr. Timothy Jackson. The due date is August 16, 2004 at 1:00p.m. Local time.  See note 22.

<DESC>In accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2.2.4 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), this public announcement is hereby issued to declare the intention of the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) to award additional effort on a single source basis to Sunhillo Corporation of Berlin, NJ, under existing contract DTFACT-04-C-00002. The Air Traffic Organization â€“ En Route (ATO-E) and National En Route Automation Division, AOS-300 have a requirement to provide second level support of systems after Government Acceptance (GA).  Those systems include the Series 1 Replacement (S1R), the En Route Communications Gateway (ECG), and the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) systems External Communications Server (ECS).  The corresponding Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) acquired these under the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  Failure to support these systems could result in a loss of air traffic control automation for En Route and Oceanic airspace. This effort will be for Software Engineering support of the En Route Communications Gateway (ECG), Series 1 Replacement (S1R) and the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) systems External Communications Server (ECS).  These systems are essential to Air Traffic Control in both the En Route and Oceanic domains of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Each of these systems utilizes proprietary software owned by Sunhillo Corporation; therefore software engineering support for all of the systems listed is only available through Sunhillo Corporation.  Contract DTFACT-04-C-00002 will be modified to support this effort on a labor hour basis for an additional four (4) year time period.  Approximately 37,000.0 labor hours will be awarded for this effort. A competitive solicitation is unavailable for this effort due to the proprietary nature of the software being utilized. If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the above services and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  Any inquiries/questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Chris Gallagher, Contracting Officer, by phone or e-mail (see above).  All responses to this announcement must be received in writing by 3:00PM EST, August 3, 2004.

A selection committee will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select a minimum of three (3) of the most highly qualified D-B firms/teams based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process.  During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements.  The RFP will contain the requirements necessary for the short-listed D-B teams/firms to submit both a Technical Proposal and a Price Proposal during Phase Two.  Those firms will be required to provide the necessary information to the EFLHD within 60 calendar days after receiving the RFP.  A site visit/pre-proposal meeting will be held within the first 21 days of this period to provide additional information.  It is anticipated that a stipend will be awarded to each Phase Two offeror who provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal (see Subsection I.A.6 of the RFP).  A copy of the draft RFP is available to interested D-B firms/teams during Phase One.

After receipt of the Phase Two Technical and Price Proposals, an Evaluation Board will conduct a “best value” analysis (see Subsection I.B.6 of the RFP), and submit their recommendations to the Selection Official for approval.  Award of one Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated approximately January 15, 2005, with Notice to Proceed issued approximately February 15, 2005.

It is not the intent of EFLHD to receive project specific design or engineering recommendations as part of this Phase One selection process.  Offerors should limit their submittals to the information required by this Notice, and other information that may be relevant to the qualifications and experience of the Offeror.  No reimbursement will be made for any expenses associated with the preparation of Phase One submittals.

Phase One Submittals:  Interested firms/teams may use Standard Forms (SF) 330 U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, as the basis for their submittals.  SF 330 is available on the Government Printing Office’s website at: http://hydra.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_files.  Although SF 330 is formatted for Architect-Engineer and Related Services, the construction elements of the firms/team’s submittal may also be included on SF 330.  Alternate forms and formats may be submitted, provided that the applicable information from SF 330 is included.  The Phase One submittals shall be bound and tabbed with the major headings.

Send eight (8) copies of the completed submittals to the following address:

	Federal Highway Administration
	Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division
	21400 Ridgetop Circle
	Sterling, VA    20166

1.1  General

This Statement of Work (SOW) details the requirements for the contractor to provide delivery of Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS) data to the Government at Headquarters Air Force Weather Agency (HQ AFWA) in its native alphanumeric format or after conversion to a World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-compliant format.  

1.2  System Description

Through cooperation between commercial airlines , a system of weather data compilation has been established to provide non standard MDCRS aircraft reports from the airlines, coded in a format of their choosing.  These reports are required for all Department of Defense (DoD) operations and are an addendum to normal information provided by Aircraft Reports (AIREPS), Pilot Reports (PIREPS), Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) reports, and Coded Aircraft Reports (CODAR) formats which are obtained by other standard weather reporting methods.  The non-standard aircraft reports can be transmitted in alphanumeric format or translated into the Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR), a WMO-compliant format per a separate agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Weather Service. 

1.3  Operational Description

Provide HQ AFWA with all automated digital reports and all non standard aircraft reports from U.S. airlines operating worldwide.  This information will be passed to HQ AFWA, in the format required, either alphanumeric or BUFR, without delay.  Data integrity from the contractor to HQ AFWA is required.  The reports are transmitted to the contractor's data center by airborne aircraft and transmitted to the HQ AFWA via the internet.

2.0  REQUIREMENTS

2.1  General Contractor Requirements

2.1.1  The contractor shall forward, without delay, all automated digital aircraft reports and all non standard aircraft reports from U.S. airlines to the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS) via the internet.  The elapsed time between transmission of the report(s) by airborne aircraft and receipt of the reports at WPMDS shall not exceed five minutes.


2.1.2  Airborne aircraft are required to transmit mandatory weather data reports.  Aircraft may also transmit random reports providing information on changing conditions.  Both the mandatory and random reports include details on current and factual weather information; including route of flight, current position and direction (longitude and latitude), altitude, time, temperature, wind speed and direction, turbulence, sky conditions, and, if applicable, icing conditions.  The contractor shall receive all mandatory and random reports transmitted by airborne aircraft and re transmit all reports to WPMDS.

2.1.3  The decoder system designed to handle the required data will process only the required data and ignore all other message traffic.

2.1.4  HQ/AFWA may request a change in format of the reports, either alphanumeric, BUFR or any other mutually agreed upon format, at any time.  This change request shall be furnished to the contractor in writing by HQ/AFWA.  The change request shall include details about the format requested and the expected date the change should be made.

2.2.  Dissemination of received data

AFWA reserves the right to disseminate all data received without restriction.

3.0  Preparation for Delivery

Delivery of data shall be in accordance with the contract.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard(USCG), Office of Contract Support, General Contract Division (G-ACS-2A) has a requirement to purchase five each Class A to Class B upgrade kits for the Spilled Oil Recovery System (SORS) aboard the Seagoing Buoy Tenders.  USCG has issued a contract to procure 11 production run Seagoing Buoy Tenders.  In compliance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), the SORS Tank on the lead vessels has been converted into a SORS Hold, for the exclusive stowage of the containment, collection, and temporary storage components of the B-Class SORS.  These components have been containerized, allowing rapid deployment in the event of a pollution incident.  This requirement is for the procurement of those portions of the B-Class SORS containment and collection system necessary to reconfigure the existing A-Class SORS containment and collection system to B-Class.  The specific items needed to make this conversion are as follows: (1) Upgraded Control Stands; (2) Hose package and outrigger assembly changes; (3) Fast Sweep Boom Assembly and Skimming System Storage Containers; (4) Skimming System Assembly Tools; (5) Coast Guard Fast Sweep Boom Tools and Spares; (6) Skimmer Spares; (7) Control Stand and Hoses Spares; (8) Outrigger Spares; (9) Boom Spares; (10) Deck Fittings Kit; (11) SORS Hose Upgrade Package; and (12) Other B-Class Items consisting of: Final B-Class Manuals, Laminated Content Cards, Container Protective Cover and Accessories, and JJ Sling.  A complete breakdown of the above items will be provided to interested parties, upon submission of an email request to Eric McDoniel, Contract Specialist, at EMcDoniel@comdt.uscg.mil.  Any other kits would force retraining and reengineering of the seagoing buoy tenders that would not be cost effective to the U.S. Coast Guard.  Delivery of the first kit shall be 60 days after date of award, and subsequent kits will be delivered one each every 30 days thereafter.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis, Hyde Marine, Inc. 28045 Ranney Parkway, Cleaveland, OH 44145.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  However, if your firm believes it could accomplish this effort in the requested time frame, indicate this interest and submit a qualifications package not to exceed 10 pages explaining your capabilities to the above listed Point of Contact no later than fifteen days after the date  of this notice.  Oral Communications are not acceptable.  Facsimile number is (202) 267-4025.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute an IFB or acquisition approach.  The Government will solicit firms meeting the screening criteria in the synopsis.  All responsible sources will be considered for note 22 and note 26.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 339999 All Other Miscellaneous General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.

MPEC Wroclaw, is planning to “wire up” the city of Wroclaw with a fiber-optic network with broadband capabilities.  Operating under the brand name e-Wro, MPEC Wroclaw has hooked up apartment blocks in one section of Wroclaw to its fiber-optic cables and is providing telecommunications services to 4,200 subscribers.  

Currently the district heating network equipped with fibre-optic cabling is within reach of about 50,000 dwelling units. MPEC Wroclaw intends to gradually put the network into operation and to offer its services in the areas covered.  The company desires to develop its network further, by using both wireless and cable technologies.  It also wants to expand the range of services that it offers, which today encompasses access to the network and the Internet, to include: (1) cable TV, (2) voice over Internet protocol (VOIP), (3) video-on-demand.  MPEC Wroclaw aims to provide such services within the area serviced by its heating network, i.e. the entire metropolitan area of Wroclaw.  Total project costs are estimated at $50 million.

The overall objective of the Feasibility Study is to establish the technical, commercial and financial feasibility, of a geographically expanded e-Wro venture with an enhanced product offering.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $429,098 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 1:00 PM, September 6, 2004 at the above address.  The opening of the proposals will take place at 2:00 PM, September 6, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>R -- Examination of Trends and Outlook for Steel Demand
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-TATD6000-04-90426

<CONTACT>Jean Greene, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-0838, Fax 301-713-0806, Email jean.greene@noaa.gov
<DESC>Congress has requested that the Department of Commerce conduct a study of the future demand for steel. This request stems from a concern for the future of the domestic steel making industry. One rationale for undertaking this project is the concern expressed by steel company and service center (distributor) executives to the Department of Commerce that their customer base, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is irreversibly shrinking. For example, these executives have indicated that steel consumers in the auto parts and castings sectors are relocating at an accelerating rate to low wage countries, particularly to other countries, where these products can be manufactured at lower cost. Press accounts suggest end users of these products in the United States are prodding their U.S. suppliers to move offshore to lower their costs.

With the trade deficit in goods rising from $436 billion in 2000 to $546 billion in 2003 (annualized), steelmakers are concerned that the trade balance in steel-containing goods is widening, with adverse impact on U.S. steel demand. 

The purpose of this study is to undertake a comprehensive examination of the long term demand for steel within the United States. The study will consider the expected demand for steel-using products and services (indirect steel imports), the impact of imports of steel-using products, and the substitution of alternative materials, and lighter weight steel by steel using industries. The study shall address the question of the extent to which the recent, 2002-2003 downturn in the demand for steel is result of short-term cyclical conditions and long-term trends.

The offeror shall undertake a quantitative analysis and make estimates of long-term demand for steel within the United States that are based on an analyses of the major steel-consuming industries and the demand for their outputs. This analysis shall at a minimum consider and quantify the factors affecting the demand for steel.

The Offeror shall estimate the extent to which the current decline in the demand for steel, 2001 to 2003, is the result of secular trends.

CAPABILITIES: 

A prospective prime contractor must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in various countries.  CLDP has a presence in the following areas: Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  A critical component for the success of this program is the contractor’s capability to obtain a line of credit ($1.5 M, and higher as program progresses) sufficient to finance required services and operations for approximately 90 days prior to contractor receipt of payment of monthly vouchers.  Also, the prime contractor must be fully capable to manage sub-contractors, and fund items and services as may be necessary or required during the contract term.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Albeni Falls project anticipates a sole source procurement of a Mitel Wireless Telephone Controller and associated equipment from TNT Communications, Inc of Spokane, Washington. In addition to supplying the specified equipment the procurement shall include engineering, wiring, programming, installation and commissioning of the specified equipment. The Code Call system is used to page employees working within the powerhouse and spillway areas of the project.  The system was installed as part of the original phone system and consists of a phone interface, power supply, contactors and bell chimes.  The  Code Call system has reached the end of its serviceable life and is currently useless.  Furthermore, technical support and spare parts for the Code Call are difficult to find. The proposed controller and equipment will replace the existing Code Call system with a new wireless IP protocol telephone network controlling digital wireless handsets.  The network will allow paging of employees working within the powerhouse or spillway and allow employees to place calls from any location within the range of the network wireless access points. This sole source is justified by 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) & FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The wireless controller and equipment is compatible with the existing Mitel telephone swit ch in service at Albeni Falls Dam.  TNT Communications, Inc is the authorized Mitel dealer and representative for this region.  The specified system is compatible with the existing Mitel telephone switch, telephone infrastructure, and desk phones.  Purchas e of other wireless systems would require replacement of existing telephone equipment at a significant cost to the Government.  Anticipated award is in the range of $75k - $100k

The renovation of AFRL  Headquarters is in accordance with the long range Strategic Plan to improve  office space to an acceptable standard and maximize efficient utilization of  WWII facilities.  A major rework of the HVAC system (1970’s vintage) and  upgrade of Fire and Life Safety systems is long overdue.  In addition to code  compliance issues, a new suspended ceiling system, new fire detection and  suppression system, new carpet and paint will be installed.  Project will be  completed in two phases due to the configuration of the air handling units and  the lack of temporary office surge space. Special Requirements and Concerns:  Tight control of all subcontractors will be  imperative for success of this project due to the high profile occupants in the  building, HQ AFRL, GAO, and ASC/JA.  The construction will be completed in two  phases.  Occupants will have to relocate to another building during their phase  of construction.  Contractor will not be able to start work on Phase II until  he has completed Phase I, the occupants have moved back to Building 15 and  Phase II occupants and their furniture have been relocated.  Contract will  include maintaining temporary electrical and HVAC systems to occupied portions  of the building during construction.  Scope also includes hazardous material  abatement of asbestos and lead paint.

Submit offers on RFQ4047.  This solicitation and its’ incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334517 and the small-business size is 100.  This is a fixed-price contract.  The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure (1) brand name or equal to a 3T MRI scanner (scanner) as defined by the American College of Radiology for the to be constructed NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) at Fort Detrick, MD.  NIAID is in the process of designing and constructing a state of the art Integrated Research Facility (IRF).  The scanner must be modified to suit the containment application and state-of-the-art at the time of delivery with full complements of accessories. The offeror will be responsible for modifications of the equipment to meet containment requirements and will work with the project design team to ensure containment requirements are met.  The offeror will be required to participate in mock up and tests with the design team to ensure the containment integrity and provide for up to four (4) factory trips for a team of four (4) (commissioning agents and NIAID representatives) to witness all acceptance testing.  The offeror shall comply with the following general considerations in high containment:  (1) areas and spaces where animals will be processed before, during and after scan procedures shall operate under the guidelines of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 4th Edition (BMBL), CDC/NIH; all standard practices and special practices as outlined in the BMBL for ABSL-4 suit laboratories and for ABSL-4 vertebrate animal holding shall be practiced as standard operating procedures; (2) primary containment, as outlined in the BMBL, will be adopted where possible for limiting aerosol generation of infectious agent and preventing cross-contamination with other experiments.  As such, animals will wherever feasible, be kept in primary containment devices, including during imaging procedures; (3) separation of containment and non-containment zones shall be by a containment barrier; the barrier shall be constructed such that it can meet air tightness criteria (pressure decay test) and withstand chemical corrosiveness testing common for all containment spaces in this project as contained in the BMBL guidelines.  Construction of the containment barrier shall be by the General contractors unless the required equipment forms part of the containment barrier; those parts of the equipment forming the barrier and exposed to the contaminated side shall perform to the same standards as the rest of the barrier; (4) install all feasible equipment parts in non-containment space, separated from the containment zone and orient equipment so that regular and long-term maintenance can be performed without entering the containment zone and (5) maintenance and calibration that can not be performed outside the containment zone shall be performed either once annually (post fumigation of space) or shall be performed in compliance with the standard and special practices as described in the BMBL for BSL-4 suit laboratory space.  To minimize the footprint within the containment area, locate all support equipment and support space in the service floor directly above the magnet or gantry as feasible.  The offeror must comply to the following specific high containment design issues:  (1) containment barrier -  (a) isolate of bore/gantry space; (i) separate the animal (patient) zone from the equipment magnet bore space or gantry and develop with the project design team separation containment by means of a sealed tube extension of the containment barrier; modify equipment (removal of cladding, etc.) to provide enough space inside tube for group 2 non-human primate that is inside isolation device; (ii) assist project design team in designing animal isolator and provide information with respect assist is integration of RF coils within isolator design; (iii) develop calibrated movement system (table mechanics) within containment “tube.” and (iv) visual access of the animal patient is required by the person at remote controls (may be via CCTV); (b) cable routing across containment barrier – (i) assist the project design team in designing all cable penetrations across the containment barrier; (ii) wiring and cable penetrations across the containment barrier must be constructed to meet containment barrier performance criteria; typically, cable shielding will be stripped to expose conductor; solid conductors, not multi-stranded, are preferred and may be required; conductors are encased in epoxy or other material resistant to chemical typically used in containment environments to provide a gas-tight penetration and (iii) provide redundant cabling for future applications.  Unless cables can be changed out, provide 100% redundancy of all conductors; (2) controls and interfaces:  (a) separation of animal procedure and control space; (i) equipment controls and data capture will be separated from animal patient procedure room.  Controls will be operated form outside containment.  Separate animal handler will process animal patient in the equipment.  (ii) animal handler may need to work with, modify the animal patient’s physical and metabolic condition before, during and after a scan procedure, including administration of additional.   Assist the design team to work through these procedures and confirm the ability to safely and efficiently do same (this is not anticipated to require equipment modification at this time); (b) equipment Controls and Operation: (i) customize equipment controls where practical to operate outside the containment zone; (ii) where controls and user interface are required in the containment zone, ensure that the operation is manageable in a BSL-4 suit laboratory environment; (iii) controls, including electronics and switches that are installed in the BSL-4 suit environment must be able to withstand fumigation decontamination processes or must be able to be easily disconnected and stored when the general space undergoes decontamination; (c) communication between control space and animal handler; (3) Decontamination; (a) Fumigation; (i) investigate compatibility with current fumigation methods for decontamination, including paraformaldehyde, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  Assist the design team in integrating decontamination strategies with equipment; (ii) modify equipment to promote complete surface fumigation decontamination.  Eliminate concealed and hidden surfaces that can be inspected and surface decontaminated; and (4) physical requirements; (a) structural; (i) maximum total weight (individual equipment) 8Kpa; (ii) maximum point load 34Mpa.  Equipment must be analyzed for containment design issues such as:  installation access; maintenance access; removal access; equipment size and weight; life cycle expectations and decontamination, effects on equipment and shielding etc.  Upon acceptance of such test by NIAID, the offeror will be required to schedule the delivery, receiving and installation with the project officer (TBD).  The approximate final construction of the IRF is estimated to be mid- FY 2007.  Delivery will not take place until the building is completed.  NIAID is not or will not be responsible for storage of the equipment before the final acceptance of equipment in place.  After the completion of the installation of equipment on site, the offeror will be required to test and commission the equipment for final acceptance by NIAID.

More than one firm will be selected from this announcement and it is anticipated that two contracts will b e awarded. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts will be negotiated and the first is anticipated to be awarded in September 2004. Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or si milar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order awar d in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost contro l, the firmÃ¢Â€Â™s strengths and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All contract s awarded from this solicitation must be awarded no later than one year from the date that the responses to this synopsis are due. Each contract will be for a maximum one-year base period from the date of award, and will contain options to extend for two a dditional periods.

The pricing schedules for the first and second option periods become effective on the 1st and 2nd anniversary dat es, respectively, of the contract award. If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year's 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unuse d dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised. Task Orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size. All interested Architect-Engineers are re minded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract wit h small and small disadvantaged businesses. If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract. The recommended goal for the work intended to be subcontracted is 57.2% for small business. Out of the 5 7.2% to small business, 10% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 10% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 3% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business) and 3% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Ow ned Small business (subset to small business). Large business firms selected for this contract will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date. If the selected firm submits a plan with less than the CorpsÃ¢Â€Â™ recommended goals, it must submit, in writing, an acceptable rationale why the recommended goals cannot be met, which rationale indicates that at the time the selected firm submitted its SF330 there was genuine belief that the goals would be virtually met and planning procee ded accordingly. The Corps will negotiate the goals if it deems appropriate, and will vacate the selection if it deems the firm was disingenuous in representing itself as committed to high small business subcontracting goals at the outset. A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>The Ogden Air Logistics Center, Training Systems Management Directorate (OO-ALC/YW) is conducting a market investigation to address: 1) Technical Refreshment, 2) Supportability, and 3) Obsolescence issues relating to the KC-10 Boom Operator Trainers (BOT). This amends the previous BOT Market Research prepared by OO-ALC/YWA, dated 23 March 2004.

To assist small businesses owned and controlled by disabled veterans, OO-ALC/YW is considering an award set aside for this effort as allowed by the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-183), signed by President Bush on December 16, 2003 and the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-50), signed by President Clinton August 17, 1999.

P.L. 108-183 enables SDV-owned firms to receive sole source and restricted competition contracts for goods and services used by the U.S. government. 

P.L. 106-50 set a 3 percent federal wide procurement goal for contracts and subcontracts for SDV-owned small firms.

The purpose of this market research inquiry is to poll the business community and determine the number of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses that are capable of addressing the KC-10 BOT issues.

If your small business is owned and controlled by service disabled veterans, and has the capability of addressing any, or all of the issues described below; please contact Linda Nelson by email (at: Linda.nelson@hill.af.mil) or by phone (at: 801-775-6981).  Please provide: 1)The name and address of the company, 2)The name of a point of contact (POC), 3)Email address and phone number of the POC.  Responses are required no later than 10 Aug 2004.

--------------------------
BACKGROUND
The current BOT is a full scale reproduction of the KC-10 Air-Refueling Operator (ARO) Station, mounted on a fixed base.  The trainer reproduces the visual, aural, and physical environment of the KC-10 ARO station with a high degree of fidelity.

There are currently two BOTs under the KC-10 training program.  One BOT is located at Travis AFB, California; and the other is located at McGuire AFB, New Jersey.  

CONTROL LOADING SYSTEM FOR BOOM FLIGHT CONTROL STICK The current “True Force” electric Control Loading System was part of a late 1990’s upgrade that is no longer supportable.  The drawings/data package is incomplete and/or inaccurate.  The current system consists of a PC-Based, 486 computer that interfaces to the “BOT Host” (DEC Alpha computer) via Ethernet, and 2 control loading modules (manufactured by CAE Link) via flat cables.  The control loading modules interface to the position feedback modules and load cells (for pitch and roll) to provide the appropriate force feedback “feel” to the stick.  The Servos and motors within the unit were originally manufactured by McFadden Electronics.  The force transducer is manufactured by A.L. Design Inc.  The sensitivity of this transducer is so high that it cannot be firmly attached to the control arm.  This results in undesirable play with the stick.

Are you a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned business with experience in control loading systems, which can provide ideas to upgrade or replace the control loading system for the boom flight control stick?  The “look and feel” of the control stick must be identical to the aircraft.

VISUAL DISPLAY PROJECTOR
The current AMPRO 4300 Visual Display is no longer manufactured.  Tubes for this projector are purchased from an outside vendor.  These tubes must then be reconfigured by maintenance personnel before putting them into the projector.

The government is looking for a “drop-in” replacement projector; however, we are open to other suggestions.  Are you a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned business with experience in visual display projectors, which can provide ideas for overcoming projector issues?  

VISUAL IMAGE GENERATOR
The current Image Generator (IG) is a CAE manufactured MAXVUE Image Generator System with a single channel output.  This system includes a “high-resolution” area in the center of the display.  

Are you a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned business which can provide suggestion for upgrading or replacing this IG?  BOT visual models are available in 2 different formats: CAE MaxVue (from the current BOTs), and “Open Flight” (from the KC135 program).

HOST COMPUTER
The current host computer is a DEC Alpha 2100-AXP with a Heurikon interface card.  DEC and Heurikon are both out of business.

Are you a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned business which can suggest a host computer replacement that is fully compatible with the other KC-10 training devices?  Distributed Mission Training (DMT) is a driver in the future, for communicating/training with other devices and sites.

SOFTWARE
Software modifications may be required for any (or all) of the previous issues.  The modified BOT must match the operation of the KC-10 aircraft.  Full compliance with the latest version of the Aerial Refueling Airplane Simulator Qualification (ARASQ) document will be required.

<CONTACT>Christi Winkler, 301-394-3385
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) W911QX-RFI-04-0001 is issued by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) to solicit information from potential sources in industry to assist in the Armys goal of providing one or more fue l cell and/or solar power systems for selected soldier power applications in support of ongoing operations within the next two years.   Toward that goal, the Government is requesting industry's input with respect to applicable specifications, and suggested  test & evaluation (T&E) procedures for units that are presently fully-engineered and packaged or will be in such a state by 1 October 2004. RDECOM will have a multi-service team review the information obtained and their findings will be used as a basis fo r future issuance of requirements and a T&E plan for sample power sources that companies may submit to RDECOM for evaluation at one or more Government facilities. Tentatively a Prototype Demonstration Announcement utilizing the information gathered under t his RFI is planned to be released during the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 presenting the opportunity to participate in a Prototype Demonstration tentatively planned for second quarter fiscal year 2005.  RDECOM intends to provide demonstration particip ants test data results (non-attributable). This is an aggressive schedule proposed to meet the Army goal of providing support to ongoing operations within the next two years. The power sources of interest must be capable of supplying steady power anywhere in the range 8 to 500 watts.  Quality considerations include ability to start and operate over the widest range of temperatures (military limits are -40 to 70 degree C), ability for rapid startup, good throttling, minimal power transients, long unattended service, orientation-insensitivity, resistance to shock, environmental pollutants, etc. The key focus of these quality considerations will be the capability to operate reliably in a middle-eastern type environment to support current operations.   The T&E plan to be submitted in response to this RFI should address how the Army can validate operating and performance specifications for the system.  The following or other relevant items should be addressed: Performance criteria to be specified; How the  source will be tested and used, i.e. configuration, stand alone/hybrid (with/without an internal/external battery supplying test load); Load voltage, current, power (average, peak, duty cycles); Minimum energy density (mass and volume); Minimum power dens ity (mass and volume); Minimum system power (hybrid) (average and peak); Minimum power generated by source (without internal/external battery); Maximum power generated by source (without internal/external battery); Minimum efficiency; Environmental testing : temperature range, humidity, filtering; Activation/shutdown: Startup time, shutdown/ cycling; Signatures: Acoustic, thermal, EM; Lab and operational system/load testing (using typical operational load cycle); Testing runtimes with/without refueling/reloc ation; continuous or start/stop; Electrical control and instrumentation of the unit and system: data acquisition, monitoring regimen, temperatures control, load control (ramping, peaks, etc); User safety, including vulnerability to shock, puncture, etc.. For consideration, please provide your input to both the criteria and T&E process to the below listed contracting officer.  Information obtained as a result of this posting may be used in the development of a Statement of Objectives for a solicitation. Thi s RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RF I or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses  to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Based on the initial submissions, the Government may request additional information/details be provided. The fuel cell evaluation team is formulating requirements for the development of a Statement  of Objectives to acquire, test and validate small fuel cell power sources to operate over the full military temperature range and in a battlefield environment. The Government desires commercially available (COTS) fuel cell power sources as well as any new  technologies or state-of-the-art fuel cell power sources. RDECOM desires maximum alternatives and choices to review as well as recommendations. The Government encourages significant participation from the full range of small business concerns. After the p erformance criteria have been established, a subsequent request for industry samples and/or an RFP may be issued. The Government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI; however, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only. RDECOM's intent is to develop a statement of objectives from the aggregate of th e information provided from industry as a whole. It is requested that responses be brief, to the point, and no more than 10 pages long (the 10 pages can be exceeded if necessary to clarify your data). Questions/concerns regarding this RFI and requests to b e included on the mailing list shall be sent, in writing, via e-mail to the Contracting Officer at RDECOMAC-Adelphi@arl.army.mil. Responses to this RFI are to be submitted and addressed to Mr. Lee Hess, Contracting Officer, at the above referenced email ad dress, no later than 20 August 2004. Responses should cite the RFI number in the subject line of the email and should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representa tives. All correspondence concerning this RFI should refer to RDECOM RFI number W911QX-RFI-04-0001

<SUBJECT>59 -- To improve computer memory, catalysts, ceramic/metal seals and nanodevices.
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking 
industrial partners interested in a patent-pending method for 
engineering interfaces between metals and the oxides of metals.

Simple method may improve computer memory, catalysts, 
ceramic/metal seals, and nanodevices

Sandia National Laboratories (www.sandia.gov) is seeking industrial partners interested in licensing a patent-pending method for engineering interfaces between metals and the oxides of metals. The allowed patent application is awaiting issuance. The method eliminates the high-temperature brazing step from the joining process of metals to metal oxides and has several potential applications.  

For instance, by improving magnetic random access memories, this method helps next generation computers boot up instantly and helps retain their entire memories after power interruptions. This technique enables the deposition of flat, nanometer-thin crystalline and ferromagnetic metallic layers on similarly thin oxide layers. The strength, stability and uniformity of the oxide-metal interface reduces material cost and requires less electricity to produce more rapid magnetic effects for the computer memory.

In addition, this inexpensive technique may produce better, less expensive (more highly dispersed but stable) catalysts for chemical reactions, better ceramic/metal seals, and lead to improved nanodevices.

Sandia is interested in partnering with companies for future applications of this technology via licensing or cooperative development agreements. Interested parties should mail or fax a statement of interest to Colleen Kearney within 30 days from the date this announcement is published at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-0115, Fax: (505) 844-8011. Please indicate the date and title of this notice and the markets in which you would like to apply the technology.

Patent Abstract
A method of controlling the growth and interfacial strength of a metal deposited on an oxide layer. 

a) By first fully hydroxylating the oxide surface and then cleaning it of impurities, deposited metals can produce a chemical reaction that oxidizes a fraction of the metal atoms and reduces hydrogen. The oxidized metal atoms are incorporated into the oxide surface and bind strongly to it by ionic bonds. However, these metal atoms also bind strongly to metallic metal above and serve as “anchors” to bind more metal. At sufficient concentration, laminar growth is achieved and crystallinity is observed at only about 6 metal atomic layers, in spite of large lattice mismatches. These findings are supported by both experimental and theoretical results.

Or b) A method of controlling the wetting characteristics and increasing the adhesion between a metal and an oxide layer. By introducing or producing a sub-monolayer of negatively-charged species to the surface of an oxide layer, layer-by-layer growth of metal deposited onto the oxide surface is promoted, increasing the adhesion strength of the metal-oxide interface. The negatively-charged species can either be deposited onto the oxide surface or a compound can be deposited that dissociates on, or reacts with, the surface to form the negatively-charged species. The deposited metal atoms can thereby bond laterally to the negatively-charged species as well as vertically to the oxide surface as well as react with the negatively charged species, be oxidized, and incorporated on or into the surface of the oxide.

52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999), award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance, The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.
§	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:
o	Factor 1 –Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Hydraulic components (repair).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance (i.e., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications).

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

<DESC>The Vicksburg Consolidated Contracts Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Foundation Telecommunications, Inc., 9379 Technology Drive, Rogers, Arkansas 72756. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) Ã¢Â€Â“ only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Operations Division has the responsibility to maintain and operate three hydro power plants within the Vicksburg District: Blakely Mountain, Degray, and Narrows. Three criteria must be met for transmission of control functions of our SCADA Network (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). 1). Provide communication reliability of 99% or better. 2) Capable of DES3 En cryption for data transmission deemed classified. 3) Capable of VPN Tunnel transmission (Virtual Private Network). Foundation Telecommunications, Inc. is the only known source that is reliable and meets the requirements of DES3 encryption. These capabiliti es exceed current T1 lines used for SCADA transmission.    Detail: 1) Reliability-The three power plants in the Vicksburg District: Blakely Mountain, Degray, and Narrows provide power, under contract for private utility companies. With remote control of five (5) hydro generating units, the reliability is required for operation and protection of millions of dollars of equipment.  Foundation Telecommunications, Inc. can provide the reliability required to meet a mission essential task of the three power plants. 2) DES3 Encryption of Data Transmission- Data transmitte d for generator control, and protection has been deemed classified and requires DES3 encryption within the system. Foundation Telecommunications, Inc. can provide the encryption required to meet the strict guidelines of the required Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA).  3)      Virtual Private Network Transmission- Our SCADA network is isolated from the outside communication world and uses a private IP (Internet Protocol) address system. To use another company that cannot provide VPN Tunneling would cre ate substantial cost to the Government, that is not expected to be recovered through competition and delays in fulfilling the mission essential task of the three power plants. Foundation Telecommunications, Inc. can provide the capability of VPN Tunneling for our SCADA system. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide this supply or service in writing to the identified point of contact not late r that 1600 hrs CST on 30 July 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this propose d effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFQ will be issued based upon this Notice of Inte nt.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Robin.L.Green@MVK02.usace.army.mil  with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.

<DESC>Technical Questions:

As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications:

1)  QUESTION:  Section I.A.1:  What software components?  Please specify the applications, versions, and their function.       

ANSWER:  The software components, applications, versions are Open VMS version 6.2.




2)  QUESTION:  How many servers carry out these tasks?   

ANSWER:  There are three (3) servers carrying out the tasks.




3)  QUESTION:  Section II.  Same question, what software, and subroutines are required to be supported?

ANSWER:  The SAS DataTrieve is required to be supported.




4)  QUESTION:  What is the health of these applications?

ANSWER:  The applications are in good condition.



5)  QUESTION:  Are these applications being updated or continually upgraded with new code?

ANSWER:  No, these applications aren't being updated or being continually upgraded with new code.



6)  QUESTION:  Please provide the current operational status of these servers and the applications.  How many users per day use these servers or applications?  How critical are these servers?   

ANSWER:  Fifty (50) users per day use these servers or applications.  The Uniformed Services University depends on the servers to process their workload. Software currently runs on the servers, which provides general accounting and funds control in addition to purchasing, fixed assets, inventory management, and cost distribution.  



7)  QUESTION:  Approximately how many trouble calls will be initiated per day/week/month?   

A specific count cannot be given.  As a requirement the contractor shall establish a point of contact where the Government may place trouble calls regarding software.  A 
qualified respondent shall initiate a reply after receipt of the Government’s trouble call.


8)  ANSWER:  What are the current problems if any with the current vendor that supports this infrastructure?          

QUESTION:  No problems exist with the current support.


9)  QUESTION:  Please define more clearly the expectations for proper operation of these servers at the operating system level to the application level.  For example, if these
servers carry out fortran jobs specified to run at certain times of the day and they fail, at what level will we be required to resolve this issue?  Obviously our firm did not write the code, but we are capable of troubleshooting fundamental VAX/VMS operating system and network issues.  It is very necessary for us to set an expectation of what is required of us in the event of a trouble call.  Please provide as much information on the VAX/VMS environment to help us ascertain if we are capable of providing a good level of support.

ANSWER:  Redundant support in the absence of critical personnel.  Systems are in a cluster configuration - 2 local systems and 1 remote system.  There isn’t a need for remote access; the contractor cans telnet into the system using the FIELD account (with a password supplied by the Government) to analyze the problem using the sysdump file.
