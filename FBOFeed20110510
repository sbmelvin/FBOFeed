<DESC>Title: Request for Information (RFI) for the Consolidation of CONUS Zones in the state of Florida and southern Georgia for Subsistence Prime Vendor Food Service Support
<p>Notice Type: Pre-solicitation<br />Response Date: May 17, 2011<br />NAICS Code: 424410, General Line Grocery Merchant Wholesalers</p>
<p><br />Dear Valued Suppliers:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e). It is not a request for proposal and does not constitute a solicitation. No proposals or unsolicited proposals will be accepted. All information received in response, however, will be handled as Proprietary Information in the same manner as an offer. The Government will not pay for any information received under or associated with this RFI. Any expenses associated with a response are the sole responsibility of the responder. Responses will not be returned. Any pricing or cost information received will be non-binding and used for informational purposes only. Failure to respond will not in any way prevent a potential offeror from participation in future solicitations. The purpose of this RFI is to seek the input of DLA Troop Support's commercial industry partners, therefore participation is encouraged. All information provided will be given consideration and may influence the development of future proposal requests.</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support Subsistence Prime Vendor Program is interested in your comments regarding possible consolidation of the current "zones" used to solicit requirements for full-line food service supply distribution. This consolidation would mean the combining of three current zones in southern Georgia and the state of Florida (except the western panhandle) into one zone. Of the current zones, one zone is comprised of Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD federally funded customers in southern Georgia and the northern area of Florida, as well as GTMO Cuba (with deliveries to Jacksonville, FL where government personnel take possession of the product and transport it to GTMO). These customers are:</p>
<p>&bull; Naval Station Mayport (Galley/FISC)<br />&bull; NAS Jacksonville (Galley/Hospital/FISC)<br />&bull; Jacksonville Job Corps Center<br />&bull; Kings Bay Trident Refit Facility<br />&bull; US Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville<br />&bull; Naval Sub Base Kings Bay, GA (Galley)<br />&bull; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Galley/Hospital/Supply) - via Jacksonville</p>
<p>The second current zone is comprised of DoD and non-DoD federally funded customers customers in the southern area of Florida, as well as Soto Cano Air Base Honduras (with deliveries to the Port of Everglades where government personnel take possession of the product and transport it to Honduras). These customers are:</p>
<p>&bull; Camp Blanding<br />&bull; Patrick AFB<br />&bull; McDill AFB<br />&bull; US Coast Guard Station Clearwater<br />&bull; Naval Ordnance Cape Canaveral<br />&bull; NAS Key West<br />&bull; Key West Diving School<br />&bull; US Coast Guard Station Opalocka<br />&bull; US Coast Guard Station St. Petersburgh<br />&bull; US Coast Guard Miami Beach<br />&bull; Miami Job Corps Center<br />&bull; Homestead Job Corps Center<br />&bull; Coleman FCC<br />&bull; Krome Detention Center<br />&bull; Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras - via Port of Everglades</p>
<p>The third current zone is comprised of AUTEC in the Bahamas (with deliveries to Jacksonville, FL where government personnel take possession of the product and transport it to AUTEC).</p>
<p>&bull; AUTEC, Bahamas - via Jacksonville</p>
<p>Input and comments are requested concerning the consolidation of these zones into one large zone, intended for award to one contractor for a one-year base period plus two one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Please consider the following questions:</p>
<p>Does the consolidation of these previously separate zones support, limit or negate your ability to offer? What effect, if any, will consolidating the two zones have on your proposed pricing? If affirmative, please provide an estimate of any cost decreases or increases that may result (on a simple percentage basis).</p>
<p>Each CONUS subsistence prime vendor solicitation requires an offeror to submit one price per item. Each line item's Unit Price is comprised of Delivered Price plus Distribution Price. Delivered Price is the price of product delivered to the distributor's warehouse plus applicable freight, and can be changed weekly during contract performance. Delivered Price must also be documented with a manufacturer's invoice. Distribution Price is a firm fixed price dollar amount offered by the prime vendor which encompasses all its other costs and profit, if any. Will you be able to adhere to this pricing structure under one zone? Specifically, by providing one price per item with a manufacturer's invoice as proof of Delivered Price, as well as actual freight cost?</p>
<p>Would you be able to support the entire zone out of one distribution warehouse? Would there be any issues with Department of Transportation (DoT) regulations concerning maximum drive times or other related regulations? Would you be able to reach each customer listed above on a regular basis to support just-in-time delivery?</p>
<p>For the resulting Request for Proposals (RFP), Best Value Source Selection procedures will be the method of evaluation, specifically Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). By offering, contractors will commit to meeting the full requirements of the RFP.</p>
<p>We encourage your participation; please share your ideas on the feasibility of this initiative. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding this proposal will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via mail or email, by May 17, 2011 at 3:00 p.m. EDT to the following address:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFACSW) intends to award a contract to one source Southern California Edison (SCE) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utility companies to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utility companies) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.  

NOTE:  The solicitation will not be made available on this website.

This notice is provided for information purposes only therefore FAR 5.203 does not apply.
  This opportunity is available only to the utility contractor servicing Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), located in China Lake, CA, under a Utilities Energy Service Contract (UESC) N62473-08-G-0605, Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for the installation, replacement, renovation, repair, operation and maintenance of energy conservation measures and consuming equipment.  Services shall include, but not be limited to, upgrades to Facilities Management Systems (FMS), installation of energy management systems and direct digital controls, implementation of energy conservation measures, and limited Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services for any energy savings devices and technologies installed under any Delivery Order awarded under this BOA at various navy facilities within the service territory of Southern California Edison.

Project Description:

Subject to the provisions of the BOA and the Delivery Order, SCE,  will supply design-build to implement energy and conservation projects in buildings 14530 at NAWS, to replace the existing boiler #14 at the boiler plant #4 including, but not be limited to, distribution piping, new controls, motors, variable frequency drives, electrical and mechanical systems infrastructure.
 Implementation of this project will allow the United States Government to effectively improve the aforementioned facilities and reduce activity natural gas demand.  The energy savings will reduce the activitys natural gas allocation resulting in utility cost avoidance and compliance with mandatory laws and statues to reduce energy consumption. The project will be financed and paid out of NAWS Public Works utility budget.

However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 
Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, ES Defensive Systems Division, 1745A West Nursery Road, Linthicum Heights, Md.
 21090.  The BOA will cover a five-year period for spares, repairs, modifications, upgrades, engineering support, technical support, logistical support, assemblies subassemblies, ancillary equipment, system and subsystem integration of the AN/ALQ-218.  The AN/ALQ-218 System covered includes the system as a whole, the individual Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), the Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs), support equipment, test equipment and applicable system firmware.  Efforts will include increasing capacity for Repair/Rework/and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification and Logistics Support Services as required.
  Additional detailed guidance will be provided as implemented by specific job orders placed under the BOA.
This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C, 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that the U.S. Government has invested in excess of $200 million into the development, test and integration of the AN/ALQ 218 into the EA-18G platform and the majority of this cost and time would have to be duplicated since another vendor would have to repeat all laboratory, ground and flight testing through full-up EA-18G weapons systems performance flight testing to qualify substitute items.
No solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps located at http://www.fbo.gov  or NECO located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, FL intends to award a modification to indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract N61331-09-D-0004 sole sourced to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935 to provide engineering and technical support services for the modification of the Carriage, Stream, Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) design as required for the development of the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM).  The contractor will modify, fabricate, and flight test the CSTRS and develop the production level design changes to incorporate Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) capabilities into the CSTRS. The contract modification is to extend the period of performance by two years from three years to five years and increase the ceiling amount.
 This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. CTC is the sole developer, integrator and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the CSTRS.  CTC possesses the detail knowledge of the CSTRS design required for the interface of the OAMCM systems and the aircraft. Therefore, CTC is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully and safely modify and flight test CSTRS as well as develop the production level design.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost to the Government.  FSC: AD25, NAICS code: 541330 Size Standard $4.5M

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL requires this exact model because it is the only model on the market that fulfills the hospitals needs of the following;  
The only product that has monitors and displays the actual fluid temperature of each bag, monitors and displays the actual time bag has been warming, rapidly warms three liter bags in about an hour, the documenter assists in compliance with regulatory standards and fluid manufacturers' recommendations, and provides Time/Date Stamp Technology, it has the capacity of holding (8) 3000 ml bags, and lastly the locking cabinet assists in compliance with regulatory standards. This vendor is the only one that makes a irrigation warmer for a 3 liter bag of fluid. 

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  A search of GSA, SBA and Vetbizops did not reveal another system with the characteristics that Ms. Miller has requested. GSA had 2 similar but did not have what Hines needed. I sent 3 FSS vendor contracts to Hines staff for their review. Hines staff determined that the 3 vendors FSS contracts did not contain an item that could meet their needs. A FedBizOpps publication will announce the intent to sole source this requirement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Overall pricing will be compared to contractor's list prices.

8.	Market survey conducted:  Barbara Miller, has indicated that this is a sole source requirement/need that is critical to their department and vital to direct patient care, throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs Agency. The Contracting Officer researched GSA, FBO, SBA and Vetbiz to verify this is a Sole Source.

9.	Other facts:  Exact model was previously purchased as a sole source and there were no objections from contractors/vendors to the FBO posting and SSJ.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  A FEDBIZOPPS ad may generate alternate sources.

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The Contracting Officer searched the Dynamic Small Business Search feature of CCR and VetBiz Registry and located 3 small businesses but a search of their schedules did not reveal comparable products. 






12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This is Project 09003415, Reconfigure Chilled Water Distribution System, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) complex. This effort includes three projects to be performed at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH: 1) Project Number ZHTV09003415 to Reconfigure Chilled Water includes upgrades to the chilled water distribution system throughout the NASIC complex, including but not limited to replacing pumps, valves, controls, piping and an enclosure on the roof of Building 829 to house the 20" header, air separator and expansion tanks; 2) Project Number ZHTV110025 Install Chiller Number 5 in Building 829 including a new cooling tower, condensing and chilled water piping, valves, direct digital controls, and pump; and 3) Project Number ZHTV110026 Replace 3, 60 ton chillers in the penthouse in Building 828, including 3 new pumps, associated piping, valves, and direct digital controls.
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: This project impacts an absolutely critical AF mission in support of war fighters. The schedule must be closely coordinated as intelligence production and analyses will be impaired by any disruption due to lack of cooling, heating, and ventilation in this essentially windowless facility. This project requires a contractor familiar with working in a secure building. NASIC requires that contractors requiring access to their facilities be U.S. citizens. The contractor should have flexibility with their work plan and be able to forecast their work. A 48-hour notice is required for access. An escort is required for all work in the NASIC Complex. The contractor will need proper manpower in all relevant disciplines to work continuously in one work area and finish the work before moving on to the next area. Furthermore, in order to reduce the impact to NASIC's mission, only part of the work area will be vacated at a time. The contractor will be required to maintain meticulously kept work sites and material and debris delivery routes through the building. This project is on a historic building and is subject to State Historic Preservation Office SHPO oversight. Buildings 858, 828, and 829 are all considered historic buildings. The project ZHTV110025 (Chiller Number 5) is also subject to a statutory limitation of $750K.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 365 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This effort includes two projects: #1 (Project 090156) as the Base and #2 (Project 090187) as the option. 1) Project 090156, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 1. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from Facility 10271 to manhole S-57 and Facility 10286. 2) Project 090187, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 4. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from manhole S-57 to the corner of Communication Blvd and Newark St. Install HTHW lateral to Bldgs 1403, 293, and 296. Remove overhead steam lines at Bldg 271. The abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. Also included is the replacement of the steam heating coil inside the air handling units inside the facilities listed above, with a new hot water heating coil, along with the installation of a new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchanger, hot water pump, and new DDC controls.
<p>Special requirements/concerns related to this project:</p>
<p>High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the HTHW system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238220 Size Standard: $14M.</p>

<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The discovery and development of an AIDS vaccine is among the highest research priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and among the principal missions of NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS). To support this mission, the incumbent Contractor provides high quality, novel, and targeted reagents, assays and services for use by the HIV/AIDS vaccine research community. Specific projects have included producing, purchasing and providing overlapping peptide sets for SIV/SHIV and HIV, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, procuring SIV and SHIV challenge stocks, and supporting the repeated and extensive proficiency testing/standardization of the widely used TZM-bl neutralization assay.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract is to support the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent Program (ARP) in achieving its goal of providing critical research reagents and resources to the scientific community. An important rate-limiting step in basic research is the identification and distribution of state-of-the-art reagents and technology. To address this need, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports the ARP as a contract. Since its establishment in 1988, the ARP has evolved from a small bank of research materials to a unique and versatile worldwide resource, offering over 8,600 critical reagents not otherwise readily available to the HIV/AIDS research community. The ARP acquires, develops, and produces state-of-the-art reagents and provides these reagents at no cost to over 3,000 qualified investigators located in 79 countries throughout the world. Additionally, the ARP serves as an important resource for information about AIDS-related reagents and disseminates this information through its comprehensive website (http://www.aidsreagent.org).</p>
<p>The current seven-year contract with Fisher BioServices, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ThermoFisher Scientific located in Germantown, MD, (N01-AI-50035; AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) expires on September 26, 2012.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors can review the website for detailed information on the ARP, its operations, and its contents at: http://www.aidsreagent.org/.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />To fulfill the technical requirements, the Contractor shall support the identification, acquisition, production, maintenance, characterization and distribution of state of the art reagents to the AIDS research community of investigators with the purpose of advancing AIDS research. Furthermore, the contract provides support for quality control and characterization of reagents, technology transfer, and execution of material transfer agreements prior to release of reagents to the community. Specifically, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Acquire/Procure, Produce/Expand HIV/AIDS Reagents.<br />2. Characterize HIV/AIDS Reagents and Manage Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA)<br />3. Store and Maintain the HIV/AIDS Reagents <br />4. Distribute the HIV/AIDS Reagents to the Research Community<br />5. Maintain ARP Databases and Websites <br />6. Provide for the overall management, integration and coordination of all contract activities<br />7. Perform activities associated with Initial And Final Transition<br />8. If options are exercised, carry out work as required to extend the term of the contract and/or for the provision of additional level of effort</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The performance requirement will be for the delivery of 10.21 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Year 2 through Year 7), which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government. The option periods may extend the term of the contract beyond the base period for up to 7 years. In addition, the Government may exercise options for increased level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work to be provided for the base period and option periods. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume in an amount of 1.0 FTE that may be exercised twice per performance year.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought<br />Capability Statements should clearly convey information regarding the respondent's capabilities, including: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>

<p>Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements should also include the above-cited information and certification for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all of the tasks mentioned above. Therefore, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and resources of subcontractors and specialized consultants to provide the full spectrum of requested activities. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed under this contract including that performed by any subcontractors and consultants.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice for a Research and Development (R&amp;D) requirement. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <strong>An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</strong>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for the renewal of the following contracts:</p>
<p>1. SSGCID: Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700057C)<br /><br />2. CSGID: Center for Structural Genomics for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700058C)</p>
<p>These contracts were awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period. This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). For more project details please see Purpose and Objectives section of this notice below.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NIAID does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this SBSS Notice, the NIAID may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIAID shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NIAID's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>If a RFP is issued, the NIAID anticipates that multiple awards may result from the issuance of the RFP.</p>
<p>The specific purpose of this project is as follow:<br />NIAID is recompeting the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases program, herein referred to as the SGCID program. This program will build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pathogenGenomics/research/Pages/relatedInitiatives.aspx</span>) to continue to address the Institute's need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome of microbes ,. <br /><br />The NIAID awarded two 5-year contracts in 2007 to support the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>1. SSGCID: Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700057C)<br /><br />2. CSGID: Center for Structural Genomics for Infectious Diseases (Contract No. HHSN272200700058C)</p>
<p>To date, the incumbent Centers have utilized high-throughput structural biology technologies and determined more than 550 three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein targets of biomedical interest from bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens. Both Centers have been utilizing small molecule/ligand screening to increase crystallization success rate and to gain functional insight through the newly observed protein-ligand interactions. The targets' 3D structure information, as well as the expression clones and peptide materials for thousands of protein targets are made rapidly available to the scientific community. Importantly, these Centers have also been providing a 3D structure determination service to the scientific community and approximately 100 3D structures were solved for community targets.</p>
<p>The contracts to be awarded under this solicitation will continue to supply the 3D structure information, reagents and services to the broad scientific community. The contracts are expected to apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) technologies and methodologies to experimentally characterize the 3D atomic structure of proteins or other molecules having an important biological role belonging to human pathogens, especially those in the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx</span>) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/Pages/list.aspx</span>). The SGCID program will also allow for support of research projects that utilize experimental approaches to better characterize the molecular functional role of protein targets whose structure was determined by the incumbent and the to be awarded SGCID.</p>
<p>The structure determination services to be provided by the SGCID program to the scientific community are expected to encourage the establishment of collaborations of the SGCID centers with outside investigators that will make use of the provided 3D structure information and of other resources to gain further knowledge about the targets' functional mechanisms. The molecular 3D structure may also assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance: </strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is five (5) years, consisting of an one (1) year base period, plus four (4) one-year options. The anticipated start date is on/or about July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, level of effort type contracts will be awarded under project. The Government's requirement for the work set forth in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) of this solicitation is estimated at 40,144 labor hours for each year of this requirement based upon the assumption of 19.3 FTE's with a FTE being defined as 2,080 hours. This requirement will consist of one (1) base period of one (1) year and four (4) one (1) year option periods. In addition to the base level of effort, each year of performance is anticipated to contain an option for up to 3 additional FTEs, in the postdoctoral, technical, and other professional staff.<br />Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NAICS Code and Size Standard</span>:</p>
<p>In the event an RFP is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to award an interim bridge contract to extend the services of the current Joint Operational Fires and Effects Course (JOFEC) contract, for a period of performance beginning 10 July 2011 - 9 September 2011.  A competitive task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660. The interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, DABK01-03-D-0008-1L03, which was competitively awarded at MICC Center-Fort Eustis, Virginia, and will expire on 9 July 2011. This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The bridge contract will be issued to the current contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This bridge contract will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS .  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 90 days to obtain for the JOFE Course.  Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this six month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 611430.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Deidra Zerzavy:  deidra.zerzavy@us.army.mil or Karen Warner:  karen.l.warner@us.army.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill Contracting Office.<br><br><br><br>

However, firms that believe they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation, in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after the publication of this notice.

<p>The risk designation associated with the work that the particular individual will be performing will determine which form the individual must complete. For this contract, the following risk designation(s) apply:<br /><br />Labor Category Risk Designation<br />AllLow -1</p>
<p>f. Forms Completion <br />The contractor must ensure that all forms are fully completed and signed prior to submission to SSA. The contractor must ensure that the fingerprint charts and all forms are printed legibly or typed in black ink and all signatures are in black ink. The contractor must also ensure there are no "breaks" in residences or employment. SSA requires complete addresses, including zip codes and phone numbers.</p>
<p>g. Forms Submission <br />The contractor shall submit a cover sheet, including the contract number, name, and social security number of all contract employees for whom they are requesting a suitability determination, along with completed forms and one FD-258 fingerprint chart to:</p>
<p>SSA<br />CPSPM Security and Suitability Team<br />6401 Security Boulevard<br />Room 1260 Dunleavy Building<br />Baltimore, MD 21235</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the contractor must submit a copy of the cover sheet to the COTR.</p>
<p>The contractor must submit these forms at least 15 days prior to the date work is to begin. For new contract employees who will need access to an SSA facility, site, information, or system, the contractor must submit these forms at least 15 days prior to beginning work under the contract.</p>
<p>h. Preliminary Suitability Determination<br />A Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint check will be used as part of the basis for making a preliminary suitability determination. If SSA makes a favorable preliminary suitability determination, the individual may perform under the contract pending SSA's final suitability determination. CPSPM will notify contractors, with carbon copy (cc) notifications sent to both the COTR and CO, of the results of these determinations.</p>
<p>SSA requires each contractor employee who will have access to a facility, site, system, or information to present two forms of identification after the contractor employee receives notification of a preliminary suitability determination but prior to beginning work under the contract. In order for SSA to continue the background investigation process and enroll the contractor employee in the PIV credentialing process, at least one of the forms of identification must be a Government-issued photo ID (please see Employment Eligibility Verification, I-9, for acceptable forms of ID).</p>
<p>i. Final Suitability Determination<br />Final suitability determinations are made in approximately 45-90 business days after submittal of the completed forms to CPSPM. If CPSPM determines that any employee is unsuitable, the COTR, CO, and contractor will be notified and SSA will revoke the employee's physical and logical access. The contractor must confirm receipt of the revocation within one business day.</p>
<p>A contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract as a result of SSA making an unfavorable suitability determination on contractor employees. Additionally, if SSA determines that the number or percentage of unfavorable determinations make successful contract performance unlikely, SSA may terminate the contract for cause or default.</p>
<p>j. Exceptions<br />The COTR may request an exception to the normal background investigation process for emergency situations when access to a facility or site is needed, but where access to information systems or programmatic information is not required. This request must be directed to CPSPM. COTRs may request an exception by sending an email to dchr.ope.hspd12appeals@ssa.gov. If CPSPM grants temporary access, that temporary access will apply only for the period specified by CPSPM and only for the specific contract employee(s) identified by the COTR. CPSPM expects that it will rarely grant exceptions.</p>
<p>k. Contractor Notification to Government<br />The contractor shall notify the COTR (who will notify CPSPM and the CO) within one business day if an employee is arrested or charged with a crime during the term of this contract, or if there is any other change in the employee's status (e.g., the employee leaves the company; the employee no longer works under the contract; the employee's alien status changes) that could impact the suitability determination for that individual. The contractor must provide in that notification as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to: employee name(s), contract number, the type of charge(s), if applicable, the court date, and, if available, the disposition of the charge(s).</p>
<p>l. Government Control<br />The Government has full control over and may grant, deny, or withhold access to a facility, site, system, or information and may require the COTR and contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract for reasons related to conduct even after the individual has been found suitable to work on the contract (see paragraph n., below).</p>
<p>m. Appeals Process for Unsuitable Determinations<br />The contractor must notify the employee of any unsuitable determinations as soon as possible after receipt of such a determination. If the employee would like clarification or wish to appeal an unsuitable determination, his/her request must be in writing and submitted within 30 days of the date of the unsuitable determination. The request can be emailed to SSA at<br />dchr.ope.hspd 12 appeals@ssa.gov, or mailed to:</p>
<p>Social Security Administration<br />Attn: CPSPM Suitability Program Officer<br />6401 Security Boulevard<br />Room 1260 Dunleavy Building<br />Baltimore, MD 21235</p>
<p>n Removal From Duty</p>
<p>SSA may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working under the contract based on conduct that occurs after a pre-screening approval or favorable suitability determination. The contractor must comply with these requests. The Government's determination may be made based on, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set forth below:</p>
<p>i. Violation of the Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds, 41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-20.3. This includes any local badging requirements.</p>

<p>(b) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual consent, identify elsewhere in this contract specific information or categories of information that the Government will furnish to the Contractor or that the Contractor is expected to generate which are confidential. Similarly, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual consent, identify such confidential information from time to time during the performance of the contract. The confidential information will be used only for purposes delineated in the contract; any other use of the confidential information will require the Contracting Officer's express written authorization. The Contracting Officer and the Contractor will settle any disagreements regarding the identification pursuant to the "Disputes" clause.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall restrict access to all confidential information to the minimum number of employees and officials who need it to perform the contract. Employees and officials who need access to confidential information for performance of the contract will be determined in conference between SSA's Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, and the responsible Contractor official. Upon request, the Contractor will provide SSA with a list of "authorized personnel," that is, all persons who have or will have access to confidential information covered by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall process all confidential information under the immediate supervision and control of authorized personnel in a manner that will: protect the confidentiality of the records; prevent the unauthorized use of confidential information; and prevent access to the records by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall inform all authorized personnel with access to confidential information of the confidential nature of the information and the administrative, technical and physical safeguards required to protect the information from improper disclosure. All confidential information shall, at all times, be stored in an area that is physically safe from unauthorized access.

<p>Whenever the Contractor is storing, viewing, transmitting, or otherwise handling confidential information, the Contractor shall comply with the applicable standards for security controls that are established in the Federal Information Security and Management Act (FISMA). (These standards include those set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) via the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publications and NIST Special Publications, particularly FIPS 199, FIPS 200, and NIST Special Publications - 800 series.)</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor, in the performance of the contract, uses any information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and/or section 1106 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306, the Contractor must follow the rules and procedures governing proper use and disclosure set forth in the Privacy Act, section 1106 of the Social Security Act, and the Commissioner's regulations at 20 C.F.R. Part 401 with respect to that information.</p>
<p>For knowingly disclosing information in violation of the Privacy Act, the Contractor and Contractor employees may be subject to the criminal penalties as set forth in 5 U.S.C. Section 552(i)(1) to the same extent as employees of SSA. For knowingly disclosing confidential information as described in section 1106 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1306), the Contractor and Contractor employees may be subject to the criminal penalties as set forth in that provision.</p>
<p>(h) The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee with access to confidential information is made aware of the prescribed rules of conduct, and the criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act and/or the Social Security Act.</p>

If the material in question is subject to the Privacy Act and/or section 1106 of the Social Security Act or is otherwise confidential information subject to the provisions of this clause, the Contractor must obtain a written determination from the Contracting Officer prior to any release, disclosure, dissemination, or publication. Contracting Officer instructions and determinations will reflect the result of internal coordination with appropriate program and legal officials.</p>
<p>(j) Performance of this contract may involve access to tax return information as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 6103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). All such information shall be confidential and may not be disclosed without the written permission of the SSA Contracting Officer. For willfully disclosing confidential tax return information in violation of the IRC, the Contractor and Contractor employees may be subject to the criminal penalties set forth in 26 U.S.C. Section 7213.</p>
<p>(k) The Government reserves the right to conduct on-site visits to review the Contractor's documentation and in-house procedures for protection of and security arrangements for confidential information and adherence to the terms of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) The Contractor must include this clause in all resulting subcontracts whenever there is any indication that the subcontractor(s), engaged by the contractor, and their employees or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees might have access to SSA's confidential information.</p>
<p>(m) The Contractor must assure that its subcontractor(s) and their employees or any successor subcontractor(s) and their employees with access to SSA confidential information are made aware of the prescribed rules of conduct. For knowingly disclosing SSA's confidential information, any subcontractor(s) and their employees or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees may be subject to criminal penalties as described in section 1106 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1306) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p>
<p>C-202402 Protecting and Reporting the Loss of Personally Identifiable Information: Responsibilities Concerning Individual Employees (DEC 2008)</p>
<p>1.Definitions</p>
<p>The following terms are defined for the purposes of this clause:</p>
<p>"Agency" means the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>
<p>"Employee(s)" means an individual(s) employed, including, for the purposes of this clause, management officials, by either the Contractor or subcontractor that are working under this contract.</p>
<p>"Handling PII" means having access, either currently or in the future, to personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in this clause.</p>
<p>"Lost, compromised, or potentially compromised PII" means that, while the Contractor/employee is in possession of PII, the PII has become physically missing (e.g., it has been stolen) or has been otherwise breached so that persons other than authorized users, and for other than an authorized purpose, have access or potential access to the PII, regardless of the form (e.g., electronic or physical) in which it was stored. Indications of lost, compromised, or potentially compromised PII include missing equipment (e.g., laptops and removable storage devices such as USB flash or "thumb" drives, CDs, DVDs, etc.) and/or paper documents potentially containing PII, as well as actions where PII was emailed in violation of the terms contained in Section 2.(d), Emailing PII, below.</p>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" (PII): SSA follows the definition of PII provided by the Office of Management and Budget in OMB Memorandum OMB M-07-16: "The term 'personally identifiable information' refers to any information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, Social Security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc." Other examples of PII may include, but are not limited to: Social Security benefit data, official State or government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, home address, and medical information. Within this clause, "PII" shall specifically mean PII as defined above which: (1) SSA has a primary responsibility for and/or interest in protecting; and (2) is made available or becomes accessible to the Contractor and/or any subcontractor, including their respective employees, as a result of performing under this contract (e.g., under the contract, SSA directly furnishes PII to the Contractor/subcontractor, or the Contractor/subcontractor, in order to perform its duties under the contract, collects PII from outside sources, such as in a public survey).</p>
<p><br />"Secure Area" or "Secure Duty Station" means, for the purpose of this clause, either of the following, unless SSA expressly states otherwise on a case-by-case basis: (1) an employee's official place of work that is in the Contractor's or subcontractor's established business office in a commercial setting, OR (2) a location within SSA or other Federal- or State-controlled premises. A person's private home, even if it is used regularly as a "home office" (including that of a Contractor or subcontractor management official), shall not be considered a secure area or duty station.</p>
<p>2. Employee Responsibility in Safeguarding PII</p>
<p>The Contractor shall establish, maintain, and follow its own policy and procedures to protect PII, including those for reporting lost or compromised, or potentially lost or compromised, PII (see Section 4. (a), below). The Contractor shall inform its employees handling PII of their individual responsibility to safeguard it. In addition, the Contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to: (1) educate employees on the proper procedures designed to protect PII, as described below and as otherwise approved by the Agency; and (2) enforce their compliance with the policy and procedures prescribed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) General. Employees shall properly safeguard PII from loss, theft, or inadvertent disclosure. Employees are responsible for safeguarding this information at all times, regardless of whether or not the employee is at his or her regular duty station. Examples of proper safeguarding include, but are not limited to: maintaining the confidentiality of each employee's individual password (by not sharing the password with any other individual or entity and not writing it down); verifying the identity of individuals before disclosing information to them; preventing others in the area from viewing PII on one's computer screen; consistently locking or logging off one's workstation when one is away; and ensuring that PII is appropriately returned or, upon receiving SSA's approval, destroyed when no longer needed.</p>
<p>(b) Transporting PII Outside a Secure Area/Secure Duty Station. Note: The term "transporting" used here does not include shipping by a common or contract carrier, as defined in FAR 47.001, or by the U.S. Post Office.</p>
<p>(1) Employees shall make every reasonable effort to safeguard equipment, files, or documents containing PII when transporting information from a secure area/secure duty station. Employees must ensure that the laptops and other electronic devices/media being used to transport PII are encrypted and password protected. The Contractor shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that the encryption and password protection are in accordance with any SSA-prescribed standards or policies which shall be communicated separately from this clause (see SSA's Information System Security Handbook (ISSH) Chapter 18 ) Employees must use reasonable protection measures when transporting PII, e.g., storing files in a locked briefcase, not leaving files and/or equipment in plain view.</p>
<p>(2) Employees transporting PII, including transporting PII duplications, such as electronic copies and photocopies, from their secure duty station or an otherwise secured area to an unsecured area shall obtain prior approval in accordance with the Contractor's established policy. The Contractor shall provide employees with contact information and instructions based on the Contractor's security/PII loss incident policy and procedures. (NOTE: Agency-prescribed contact information and instructions for reporting lost or possibly lost PII are discussed in Section 3. below.)<br />(3) Tracking files. <br />Unless the PII is being transported for disposal pursuant to the contract, (see (c) below), the Contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to ensure that the file(s) or document(s) being physically transported or transmitted electronically outside the secure area/secure duty station are tracked through a log: they must be logged out prior to transport as well as logged back in upon return. The Contractor can establish any mechanism for tracking as long as the process, at a minimum, provides for the following information to be logged:</p>
<p>first and last name of the employee taking/returning the material;</p>
<p>the name of the file or document containing PII that he/she intends to transport from the office;</p>
<p>all the forms or media in which the PII was transported (e.g., electronic, such as laptop, thumb drive, CD-be as specific as possible; paper, such as paper file folders or printouts);</p>
<p>the reason he/she intends to transport the file or document containing PII;</p>
<p>the date he/she transported the file or document containing PII from the secure duty station; and</p>
<p>the date he/she returned the file or document containing PII to the secure duty station.</p>
Materials must be returned or documented as destroyed within 90 days of removal from the office or have Contractor supervisory approval for being held longer.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The log must be maintained in a secure manner. Upon request by the Agency, the Contractor shall provide the information from the log in a format (e.g., electronic or paper) that can be readily accessed by the Agency.</p>
<p>(c) Employee Disposal of PII. The marked statement below applies to this contract: [Contracting Officer: Mark the appropriate statement below.]</p>
<p>[ ] This contract entails employee disposal of PII. Employees shall follow the procedures described in SSA's Information System Security Handbook (ISSH) Chapter 10.</p>
<p>[ X ] This contract does not entail employee disposal of PII. The Contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to ensure that the procedures detailed in (3) above pertaining to the logging of PII that is transported outside a secure area/from their secure duty station are followed.</p>
<p>(d) Emailing PII. The Contractor's corporate or organizational email system is deemed not to be secure. Therefore, the Contractor shall put policies and procedures in place to ensure that its employees email PII using only the following procedures in (1)-(2), below:</p>
<p>(1) Sending from an SSA email address. If employees have been given access to the SSA email system, they may use it to send email messages containing PII in the body or in an unencrypted attachment but only to other SSA email addresses (which contain the "name @ssa.gov" format) or to email addresses belonging to an SSA-certified email system. Email directed to any other address(es) may contain PII only if the PII is entirely contained in an encrypted attachment.</p>
<p>(2) Sending from a non-SSA email system. If employees are using the Contractor's own or any other non-SSA email system (e.g., Yahoo!, Gmail), they may send email messages transmitting PII only if the PII is entirely contained in an encrypted attachment; none of the PII may be in the body of the email itself or in an unencrypted attachment. When emailing from such systems, this procedure applies when emailing PII to any email address, including but not limited to, an SSA email system address. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the Contractor and its employees are expected to conduct business operations under this contract using the Contractor's own email system, i.e., in accordance with the foregoing rules for transmitting PII.</p>
<p>3. Agency-Prescribed Procedures for Reporting Lost, Compromised, or Potentially Compromised PII.</p>
<p>"Lost, compromised, or potentially compromised PII" is defined in Section 1., above. The reporting requirement established in this section is for reporting all incidents involving PII, with no distinction between suspected and confirmed breaches.</p>
<p>SSA has its own reporting requirements for PII that is lost, compromised, or potentially compromised. The purpose of this section is to ensure that these requirements are met and that incident information is shared appropriately.</p>
<p>(a) Contractor Responsibility. In addition to establishing and implementing its own internal procedures referenced in Section 2., above, the Contractor is responsible for taking reasonable actions to implement Agency-prescribed procedures described in (c) below for reporting lost, compromised, or potentially compromised PII. These include educating employees handling PII about these procedures and otherwise taking appropriate and necessary steps to enforce their compliance in carrying them out.</p>
<p>(b) Potential Need for Immediate, Direct Reporting by the Employee. SSA recognizes that Contractor employees will likely make the initial discovery of a PII security breach. When an employee becomes aware or suspects that PII has been lost or compromised, he/she is required to follow the Contractor's established security/PII loss incident reporting process (see Section 4. (a), below). The Contractor's reporting process, along with SSA's (see Section 3. (c) below), shall require the Contractor, and not necessarily the employee, in such circumstances to notify SSA of the incident. However, the Contractor shall inform each employee handling or potentially handling PII that he/she must be prepared to directly notify outside authorities immediately as described in (c)(4) below, if, shortly following the incident or discovery of the incident, he/she finds it evident that neither an appropriate Contractor nor SSA manager/contact can be reached. The Contractor should emphasize to the employee that timeliness in reporting the incident is critical.</p>
<p>(c) Procedures.</p>
<p>(1) When an employee becomes aware or suspects that PII has been lost, compromised, or potentially compromised (see 1. Definitions, above), the Contractor, in accordance with its incident reporting process, shall provide immediate notification of the incident to the primary SSA contact. If the primary SSA contact is not readily available, the Contractor shall immediately notify one of two SSA alternates, if names of alternates have been provided. (**See worksheet for the identity of the designated primary and alternate SSA contacts.**) The Contractor shall act to ensure that each employee, prior to commencing work on the contract, has been given information as to who the primary and alternate SSA contacts are and how to contact them. In addition, the Contractor shall act to ensure that each employee promptly receives any updates on such information as they are made available. Whenever the employee removes PII from a secure area/secure duty station, he/she must comply with the Contractor's security policies, including having on hand the current contact information for the primary SSA contact and the two alternates.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall provide the primary SSA contact or the alternate, as applicable, updates on the status of the reported PII loss or compromise as they become available but shall not delay the initial report.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall provide complete and accurate information about the details of the possible PII loss to assist the SSA contact/alternate, including the following information:</p>
<p>I. Contact information;<br />II. A description of the loss, compromise, or potential compromise (i.e., nature of loss/compromise/potential compromise, scope, number of files or records, type of equipment or media, etc.) including the approximate time and location of the loss;<br />III. A description of safeguards used, where applicable (e.g., locked briefcase, redacted personal information, password protection, encryption, etc.);<br />IV. An identification of SSA components (organizational divisions or subdivisions) contacted, involved, or affected;<br />V. Whether the Contractor or its employee has contacted or been contacted by any external organizations (i.e., other agencies, law enforcement, press, etc.);<br />VI. Whether the Contractor or its employee has filed any other reports (i.e., Federal Protective Service, local police, and SSA reports); and<br />VII. Any other pertinent information <br /><br />The Contractor shall use the worksheet (or a copy thereof) following this clause to quickly gather and organize information about the incident.</p>
<p>(4) There may be rare instances outside of business hours when the Contractor is unable to reach either the primary SSA contact or any of the alternates immediately. In such a situation, the Contractor shall immediately call SSA's Network Customer Service Center (NCSC) at 410-965-7777 or toll free at 1-888-772-6111 to file the initial report directly, providing the information in (c)(3) above and completing the attached worksheet to the best of its ability. Overall, during this time, the Contractor shall cooperate as necessary with the NCSC or any of the other external organizations described in (c)(3) above.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall document the call with the CAPRS (Change, Asset, and Problem Reporting System) number which the NCSC will assign. The Contractor shall provide the CAPRS number to the primary SSA manager, or, if unavailable, one of the alternates to this manager as described above.</p>
<p>If an employee initially detects the loss, compromise, or potential compromise of PII and finds it evident that neither an appropriate Contractor nor SSA manager/contact can be promptly reached, the employee shall undertake the foregoing actions prescribed to the Contractor in this part (i.e., immediately call the NCSC, document the CAPRS number assigned to the call, etc.). (Reference Section 3.(b) above.)</p>
<p>(5) The Contractor and its employee(s) shall limit disclosure of the information and details about an incident to only those with a need to know. The security/PII loss incident reporting process will ensure that SSA's reporting requirements are met and that security/PII loss incident information is only shared as appropriate.</p>
<p>4. Additional Contractor Responsibilities When There Is a Loss of PII.</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall have a formal security/PII incident reporting process in place that outlines appropriate roles and responsibilities, as well as the steps that must be taken, in the event of a security/PII loss incident. The plan shall designate who within the Contractor's organization has responsibility for reporting the loss, compromise, or potential compromise of PII to SSA.</p>
<p>(b) In the event of a security/PII loss incident, the Contractor shall take immediate steps to address consequential security issues that have been identified, including steps to minimize further security risks to those individuals whose personal information was lost, compromised, or potentially compromised.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall confer with SSA personnel in reviewing the actions the Contractor has taken and plans to take in dealing with the incident.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall bear the responsibility and any cost for any data breach and/or remediation actions that might arise from the security/PII loss incident. If SSA determines that the risk of harm requires notification of affected individual persons of the security breach and/or other remedies, the Contractor shall carry out these remedies without cost to SSA.</p>
<p>5. Applicability of this Clause to Subcontractors/Subcontractor Employees</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall include this clause in all resulting subcontracts whenever there is any indication that the subcontractor and their employees, or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees, will or might have access to PII.</p>
<p>(b)The Contractor shall, within reason, take appropriate and necessary action to assure SSA that its subcontractor(s) and their employees, or any successor subcontractor(s) and their employees, with access to PII know the rules of conduct in protecting and reporting the loss or suspected loss of PII as prescribed in this clause, such as those regarding the emailing of PII as stated in Section 2.(d) above.</p>
<p>(c) Notification of Subcontractor Handling of PII. If the Contractor engages a subcontractor under this contract whose employee(s) will actually or potentially be given or have access to PII, the Contractor shall do the following: (1) Notify in advance both the SSA COTR and the Contracting Officer of this arrangement, providing the subcontractor name(s) and address(es) and, upon request, a description of the nature of the PII to which the employee(s) will actually or potentially be given/have access (e.g., phone numbers, Social Security numbers); and</p>
<p>(2) Provide the SSA COTR the names of the subcontractor employee(s) who will actually or potentially be assigned and/or have access to the PII. The Contractor may satisfy this requirement when submitting the name(s) of the subcontractor employee(s) to the SSA COTR for the requisite security background check described in Section 6., below.</p>
<p><br />6. Contractor/Subcontractor Background Checks - Security &amp; Suitability Requirements Clause</p>
<p>For each Contractor and subcontractor employee handling PII, the Contractor shall fulfill the requirements of the Security &amp; Suitability Requirements Clause, found elsewhere in this contract, to ensure that any such individual has the appropriate background checks.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>PAST PERFORMANCE<br />SSA's evaluation of past performance will take into account the past performance of the offeror and any proposed subcontractors. It will be a subjective risk assessment based on information provided by the offeror and/or obtained independently by SSA from a variety of public and private sources, including but not limited to, the references of those projects indentified in the offer.<br />The government will perform its evaluation in part by looking at the following:<br />a.Quality of Service - Compliance with contract requirements; customer satisfaction;<br />b.Schedule - Reliable; responsive to technical direction; adhered to the contract schedule; completed on time including wrap-up and contract administration, no liquidated damages or history of significant performance penalties; etc.<br />c.Business Relations - Effective and efficient management; businesslike correspondence; responsive to contract requirements; prompt notification of problems; reasonable/cooperative behavior; flexible; pro-active; effective and efficient contractor recommended solutions; effective and efficient small/small disadvantaged business subcontracting programs, etc.<br />d.Management of Key Personnel - Effective and efficient management of work force, work force properly trained and given proper direction to ensure that required tasks are successfully performed; responsive to contract requirements; reasonable/cooperative behavior; etc.<br />Whereupon an offeror has no record of recent (within the last 3 years) or relevant (similar in size, scope, and complexity to the SOW) past performance or for whom past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated neither favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>PRICE - The Government will evaluate price separately from all other factors. However, price will be considered in the final best value determination and any trade off analysis.<br />For the non-price evaluation factors, Experience is of greater importance than Past Performance. Experience and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). The associated contract clauses and statement of work are included with this synopsis/solicitation are provided with this solicitation. <br /><br />All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below: <br /><br />1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. <br /><br />1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. <strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 6, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br /></strong><br />1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br /><br />1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question. All questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the closing date of the RFP. <strong>All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 1, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time. <br /></strong><br />1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:<br />1. Sodar must capable of operating with AC power only.<br />2. Sodar must be able to generate high quality measurements using 10-minute averaging times, with 10 m range gates, and with data recovery rates greater than 90% at elevations in excess of 100 m during typical operations. Please provide a customer reference demonstrating success to these standards in a hot, low humidity environment (RH&lt;20%) using the quoted sodar.<br />3. Sodar must be able to operate reliably throughout a continuous year-long deployment in very hot, windy, and dusty conditions to possible conditions of snow and ice. A self-contained, all-weather enclosure is required for the electronics. Please state model and operating range specifications of computer and other hardware.<br />4. Sodar must have provision for the automated removal of snow and ice.<br />5. Significant sources of noise and other possible interferences as well as high winds are expected at the deployment site and will require the installation of an antenna enclosure capable of significantly attenuating interference. Please provide a description of and dimensions of the enclosure.<br />6. Twisted pair Ethernet connection, 10 mb (RJ45 jack).<br />7. Ability to aggregate 10-minute averages on an hourly basis and automatically upload them to a database within 12 minutes after the top of each hour.<br />8. Full capability to set all basic operating parameters of the sodar via Ethernet (e.g., averaging period, range gates, height, etc.).<br />9. It is anticipated that the expected interference problems (5 above) will cause problems with obtaining reliable, high quality measurements. Consistently accurate, high quality datasets are fundamental to the success of the project. This will necessitate adjustments to operating parameters to improve data quality and recovery rates. This requires that the user have complete control (via Ethernet) over the setting of all operating parameters through the system control software that could be adjusted to improve data quality. Please list those operating parameters of the system control software that can be controlled by the user for this purpose and are included in the quote.<br />10. For the same reason, we require high quality datasets that can be thoroughly evaluated for quality control purposes. This requires that the user have complete control (via Ethernet) over the setting of all data acceptance criteria and data validation functions through the system control software. A precipitation sensor with software for the automatic invalidation of data during rain or snow is required. Please list all data acceptance and validation criteria that are controlled by the user through the system software included in the quote.<br />11. Reliable remote operation is essential as the site will only be visited about once every 6 weeks. To ensure reliable operation, it is a requirement that the user have access to system self-diagnostic information via Ethernet communications that can be used to monitor all major aspects of system performance, operation, and maintenance on a routine basis. Examples include power supply voltage, monitoring input/output signals, echo checks, and spectral analysis. Please be explicit about what is included in the quote.<br />12. To ensure reliable operation, we require the capability to perform procedures available through the quoted system control software that provide ways to check, test, and verify all system diagnostics, calibration, and component performance independently of system self-diagnostics. In particular, the ability to independently test antenna functions (transmit and receive, phasing, capacitance) is necessary. Please be explicit about what procedures and tools are included in the quote.<br />13. Part of rigorous data quality control is having the capability to evaluate and analyze the data being generated by the system. The visualization and graphical display of data is particularly important in this regard. We require the reporting of all three wind components and their sigma values and range statistics as well as visualization software tools for reviewing vertical wind profiles, time series, facsimile of intensity values, wind roses, signal amplitudes, and spectra. Please list what data is provided and what visualization tools are included within the quote.<br />14. A fully portable unit that can be readily disassembled, loaded into a pickup truck, and reassembled by a 2-man crew by hand, without assistance of any mechanical devices. Maximum weight of any individual component cannot exceed 100 pounds (approx. 45 kg). Maximum dimensions of any individual component cannot exceed 5 feet by 5 feet by 4 inches.<br />15. Training will be provided for up to 5 staff members on the quoted sodar. The training should be adequate to provide a comprehensive overview of system operation and introduction to all aspects of installation, configuration, operation, data acquisition and management, software, maintenance, and diagnostic testing and troubleshooting. Please state the training time and costs required to accomplish these requirements for training provided in Idaho Falls. The software training must include those features related to items 8-13 above. <br />16. A complete manual that provides a comprehensive explanation and description of all aspects of the quoted sodar is required. This must include installation, configuration, operation, data acquisition and management, software, maintenance, and diagnostic testing and troubleshooting. The manual must explicitly describe the software features, tools, and procedures related to items 8-13 above. <br />17. Delivery in 30 days from order.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is to provide the questions and answers the Government received in response to RFQ # D11PS18895.


Questions and Answers for RFQ # D11PS18895 - Rain Gauge and Snow Cutter
Question 1 Page 6 of the solicitation lists a standard nameplate drawing WS-N-SD001 which is missing from the solicitation drawing set.
Please let me know where I can obtain a copy. 
Answer 1
The standard nameplate drawing WS- N-SD001 can be found at:
http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=394


Question 2 Are partial shipments acceptable in lots of 100-200 pieces?  And if so, what is a reasonable timeframe between shipments.
Answer 2
If the Contractor requests partial shipments the Contractor shall submit a delivery schedule with the quote submitted to NOAA.  NOAA would prefer a 3 shipment option and requires the rain gauges and snow cutters as soon as possible.  Proposed delivery schedule should ensure that products are received as expeditiously as possible.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.     Background  The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.  The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by &ldquo;bridges&rdquo;. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.  The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&amp;IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&amp;IS&rsquo;s Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&amp;IS&rsquo;s Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Center&rsquo;s Hospital Information System (CRIS).     Purpose   This request is for the purchase of renewing the maintenance contract with Cerner Corp. for it&rsquo;s Radiology Information System (RIS). The Cener RIS is a proprietary system in daily use by the RAD&amp;IS for critical patient care. The current contract expires May 31, 2011.  A renewal of the existing contract is needed to provide support for the RIS until it is replaced.     Scope  To the continue service of the existing RIS system for the Department of Radiology and Imaging Science in the Clinical Center   The Cener RIS is a critical patient care system in daily use within the Clinical Center in support of care of diagnostic and research studies for patients in clinical protocols and the NIH Clinical Center mission of providing quality patient care.     1.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date to May 18, 2011 and to post replies to questions submitted regarding this RFI.  Please see file "SPICE_RFI_QA_Mod3".  No further questions may be submitted.  

1.	The Government is issuing this announcement as part of a market survey for a long endurance, ship-based, offboard vehicle capable of carrying an active Electronic Warfare (EW) payload for use in next generation coordinated Onboard/Offboard EW countermeasures missions.  

2.	To achieve EW mission effectiveness the vehicle must be compatible with ship operations in the maritime environment up to and including sea state five conditions.  Innovative technologies are required that minimize the shipboard operational and logistics footprint concerning storage, refueling, maintenance, safety, and launch and recovery operations.
  It is envisioned that ship systems will provide initial positioning, velocity, and vehicle direction information.  The system should be capable of autonomous operation and have communications capability for minimal interaction with the launch/control platform to receive mission updates and report health and location status.  Concepts for this vehicle system must be realized while minimizing manning requirements during shipboard operation.  Technologies that utilize shipboard available energy sources are essential and use of existing command and control links on U.S. Navy ships is preferred.  Liquid fuel based systems must comply with DoD Directive 4140.25 regarding fuel standardization.  Potential vehicle solutions may include but are not limited to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).
  Expendable systems concepts will be considered if they can be shown to provide total cost of ownership benefits.

3.	The vehicle must be able to carry a nominal 35 lb. payload (minimum 25 lb. to maximum 50 lb.),  provide 1KW of payload prime power and accommodate placement of a transmit and receive antenna pair with an unobstructed 90 degree field of regard, integrated with the vehicle platform to achieve maximum transmit to receive isolation. The vehicle must be capable of steering the vehicle/antenna pair over a 360 degree azimuth in winds from any direction.  Each vehicle must be able to achieve and maintain station keeping relative to ships position for a minimum of 2 hours duration, with longer duration preferred.
 The systems concept must show command & control capability for operating 3 platforms simultaneously from a single control station and conducting sorties to achieve continuous station keeping for a mission length of 24 hours, with minimum impact to shipboard storage, operations, and required manpower.  For the purposes of this RFI, assume the system is stored, deployed, and operated from a single ship, and a single control and handling crew will be utilized to support the entire mission. 

4.	This market survey will support an Analysis of Alternatives where vehicle analysis will take into account physical characteristics, operational effectiveness, suitability, logistical characteristics, and life-cycle cost to assess particular vehicles potential abilities to successfully execute the mission.
 Conclusions drawn from the AoA will form a portion of the basis for a Milestone B decision, currently planned for FY13.  Funding for this effort is expected to be available in FY12 with a low rate initial production planned for FY18.

5.	The government is seeking interested parties that may have developed or would be capable of developing potential vehicle solutions for this analysis that have one of the following attributes:

a.	Vehicle/system performance that can meet stated requirements with either little or moderate adaptation, upgrade, modification, or development from an existing demonstrated and tested system. Technology risks associated with the vehicle have been sufficiently reduced such that the system can achieve a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 at Milestone B.
  TRL 6 is achieved when system/subsystem models or prototypes have been demonstrated for this program in a relevant marine environment (Source: Defense Acquisition Guidebook)

b.	Innovative solutions that have not fully matured but that can be shown to be expected to meet the requirements in the allotted timeframe. 

6.	White paper responses to this RFI may be up to the SECRET level and may not exceed twenty (20) pages.  Interested sources possessing the capacity to deliver a vehicle system meeting the conditions outlined above are requested to respond.  Any information that the responder considers to be proprietary should be clearly marked.  The government will protect such information in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
  White paper responses should include the following items:

a.	General concept description or approach to meet the aforementioned requirements and attributes.
b.	System description to include, but not limited to:
i.	General vehicle/system description;
ii.	Vehicle operating characteristics (dash, cruise, & loiter speed, and system endurance referencing specific associated parameters); 
iii.	Vehicle dimensions, size, weight; 
iv.	Propulsion system description including fuel/energy source;
v.	Payload size and weight capacity, and power available;
vi.	Command/control/communications systems concept description for multi-vehicle operation and dynamic retasking considering maximum use of existing ships system;
vii.	Storage, launch, and recovery equipment, footprint, and procedures description;
viii.	Vehicle quantities, manpower and logistics to achieve mission; 
ix.	Ship compatibility and compatibility with marine environment;
x.	Cost information;
xi.	Current vehicle/system uses;
xii.	Technology Readiness Level information.
c.
   Performance requirements compliance matrix, using the format provided in the RFI attachment, to document the proposed systems ability to meet outlined requirements. Identify which capabilities have been demonstrated.
d.   Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the program and respective risk mitigation approaches.
e.   Identify performance requirements or functionality that would require adaptation, upgrade, modification or development.
f.	If necessary, provide a spiral development process that will result in a fully compliant vehicle in the desired timeframe.
g.   Any additional information to support claims that the system performance will meet the capabilities contained in this announcement.

7.	White paper responses are due May 18, 2011.
   If the response if classified, submit two (2) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy on compact disc to Erica Bowling at the following address:

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)
1333 Isaac Hull Ave., SE
Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040
Attn: Erica Bowling 02532B

If the response is unclassified, it may be submitted via email at erica.l.bowling@navy.mil.  

8.	The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses.  Please note that the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions.  The Government may ultimately develop and issue a Request for Proposals (RFP)   However, the Government is under no obligation to issue an RFP.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The USPS awarded a hybrid Indefinite Delivery/Quantity/Firm-Fixed Price contract for line items and services against solicitation # 3CW-11-A-0003 to Hollingsworth Logistics Group (HLG) for the operation of a Mail Transport Equipment Center (MTESC)&nbsp;in Martinsburg, WV in the National Capital Region (currently Front Royal MTESC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance starting from 07/01/2011 consists of a two (2) month Initial Operating Capacity (IOC) period, thirty four (34) month Base Period, and two Option Periods of twenty four (24) month each. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Solicitation # 3CW-11-A-0003 was issued directly to the prequalified suppliers on November 19, 2010. The proposals were due by&nbsp;01/18/2011. The Martinsburg MTESC will be part of the Postal Service's network of 15 MTESC sites. The purpose of the Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) network is to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality MTE ready for rapid deployment to Postal facilities and the customers. MTESCs will process the MTEs as specified in the statement of work. The MTESC will receive MTE, examine it, and route it for reuse if serviceable, repair it if defective but repairable, or dispose it off if beyond repairable. (Disposal may be through waste pickup or material recycling and will be directed by the Postal Service.) Each MTESC in the network will be responsible for processing and repairing MTE for use by Postal facilities and commercial mailers. The MTE network will provide an efficient means of continuously improving the management of MTE processing, repair, and distribution functions. Other benefits expected from the MTE network include better MTE performance and life cycle data and improved control over the disposal of condemned MTE. The MTE network will also allow Postal Service Area and Headquarters staff to continuously balance MTE inventories within and among all Postal Service Network both effectively and efficiently.

Based on RFQ VA-69D-11-RQ-0075 entitled "S5I IMAGING SYSTEM" for the William S. Middleton VA Hospital, Madison, WI," award has been made to VOLCANO CORPORATION INC at the total contract amount of $155,000.00 as a sole source procurement.

Thank you for your interest in this procurement. 

Sincerely,


Scott Ivy
Contracting Officer
Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC)
Milwaukee, WI
































JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Volcano Corporation's s5I Imaging System, Madison VA
	
1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of 2 Volcano Corporation's s5I Imaging System (intravascular ultrasound system) for the VA Hospital in Madison, WI.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Volcano Corporation. 

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Madison, WI, has a requirement for a one time purchase of 2 S5I Imaging Systems  
(intravascular ultrasound system).  The approximate cost is $155,000.00 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Madison, WI requires this exact model because it is the only model on the market that fulfills the hospitals needs of the following;  
Volcano Corporation's s5I Imaging System (intravascular ultrasound system), is the only system that has FFR (fractional flow reserve), built in, which would take the place of two instruments (a separate IVUS and a separate FFR). The Volcano also has the OCT (optical coherence tomography) capability and accommodates different catheters, including peripheral catheters, AAA IVUS catheters and FFR wires. Boston Scientifics' IVUS system does not have an FFR and the St. Jude IVUS system does not have an FFR.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  A search of GSA, SBA and Vetbizops did not reveal another system with the characteristics that Madison has requested. GSA had 1 similar but did not have what Madison needed. A GSA Waiver was pursued and granted by NAC. A FedBizOpps publication will announce the intent to sole source this requirement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Overall pricing will be compared to contractor's list prices. I have purchased this once previously at the noted price. The quote Madison received was about eighteen thousand higher but has more options than previous purchase. $155,000 was the quoted price to Madison.



JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Volcano Corporation's s5I Imaging System, Madison VA

8.	Market survey conducted:  Madison has indicated that this is a sole source requirement/need that is critical to their department and vital to direct patient care, throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs Agency. The Contracting Officer researched GSA, FBO, SBA and Vetbiz to verify this is a Sole Source. Madison did a direct comparison of the other 2 vendors that sell a compatible product and stated that Boston Scientific and St. Jude do not have the features or capabilities that they require.
Boston Scientific and St. Jude do not provide FFR (fractional flow reserve).
 
9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  A FEDBIZOPPS ad may generate alternate sources.

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The Contracting Officer searched the Dynamic Small Business Search feature of CCR and VetBiz Registry but did not reveal comparable products. There were multiple sole source awards for the exact same item on FBO in the archives.   

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<AWDDATE>051311
<DESC>The services requested are for the Return Preparer Registration contractor to implement new requirements that are the result of IRS Senior Leadership policy decision making that was reached after the Return Preparer Registration contractor was awarded.  Neither the IRS nor any particular vendor could have anticipated these requirements and incorporated them into the original Return Preparer Registration contract.

The Return Preparer Registration contractors solution is built around the Tax Preparer PTIN System (TPPS), which the contractor built, deployed, operates, and maintains for the Service and is inextricably integral to the contractors solution for Return Preparer Registration.  The services requested require the contractor to make significant changes to the TPPS.

In order to meet filing season deadlines for having the required services completed by no later than 9/30/2011, in time for the Return Preparer open season registration that begins on October 16, 2011, the contractors knowledge and expertise with the TPPS system and data uniquely positions the contractor to be capable of delivering the services required in time for the next filing season.

A new contractor would not only have to build a system to support the requirement but would also have to recreate the entire TPPS system.  An undertaking that could not be achieved in the requisite time frames and that could not be done without completely disrupting current return preparer implementation processes and disrupting and delaying the timely registration and processing of over 700,000 Tax Preparers in time for the coming filing season.
