<SUBJECT>Medical Expenditure Panel (MEPS) - Medical provider Component (MPC)
<SOLNBR>AHRQ-13-10001
<RESPDATE>011413
<CONTACT>Robert A Zuhlke, Phone 301-427-1714, Fax 301-427-1740, Email robert.zuhlke@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates posting a solicitation for proposals for a 61 month (base period of 5 months with 4 separate 20-month extension options) cost plus fixed fee contract for the maintenance and fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support - Medical Provider Component (MPC) which will include collecting, editing, and analyzing data collected from the on-going MEPS-HC (household component) contract.
<p>The MEPS Medical Provider Component (MPC) collects data from all hospitals, emergency rooms, home health care agencies, outpatient departments, long term health care facilities and pharmacies reported by MEPS Household Component (HC) respondents as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital. Office based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well. HMOs are included in the MPC data collection. For this contract, long term health care facilities include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, rehabilitation facilities, as well as any health care facility providing medical care to those reporting such care in the HC of the MEPS. Jails, prisons, and medical facilities or pharmacies outside the United States are considered out of scope for the MPC.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home health agencies, pharmacies, long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS sample persons. Such data are essential to improve the accuracy of the national medical expenditure estimates derived from the MEPS, since household respondents are not always the most reliable source of information on medical expenditures. The data also serve as the primary imputation source of medical expenditure data to correct for the item non-response on this measure by the MEPS household sample participants. MPC data also serve as an imputation source for item non-response to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures. They also serve as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital, as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients. The sample for the MPC is chosen from medical providers identified in the HC as having provided care to the sample person during the year.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for conducting the MPC data collection, the preparation of MPC data files needed for producing MEPS HC data files and expenditure estimates, matching HC and MPC data, and the production of an extensive array of analytic files which will include raw data files, matched data files and files that will include matching variables as well MPC variables needed for editing and imputation. The latter files will need to be in the appropriate format to be input directly into the expenditure and editing programs. In addition, the offeror is expected to use and maintain an electronic data capture application which allows for data to be entered no matter the mode of collection (telephone, record abstraction, CD-ROM, or FTP). Each year of the MPC, all providers shall be screened to ascertain their eligibility, their association with the MEPS household respondent, and to obtain information to facilitate the conduct of the core MPC interview. Appropriate security measures must be demonstrated with regards to maintaining the confidential protection of data collected.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI), Modernized Commodity Fuze
<SOLNBR>EBDZ-MCF-001
<RESPDATE>101912
<CONTACT>Erik J. Urban, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)883-0263, Email erik.urban@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Modernized Commodity Fuze<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. This is a Request for Information (RFI) from any interested party eligible to contract with the US Department of Defense concerning a potential modernization effort for the FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF). Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to refine the modernization acquisition plan, but may also be used to perform studies and analyses on existing and future fuzed weapons capable of being deployed from current and future fighters and bombers to perform required missions against a variety of soft and hardened targets. The RFI is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not construed as a commitment by the government. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br /><br />2. Foreign Participation: Any contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy, and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. If the interested party is a foreign concern or if a U.S. interested party has a team member or partner who is a foreign entity, adherence to all International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) is required. The U.S. Government will provide foreign disclosure guidance to U.S. firms upon request.</p>
<p>3. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Direct Attack Division, Fuze Branch (AFLCMC/EBDZ), Eglin Air Force Base is planning to modernize the FMU-152A/B design to support affordable and reliable long-term production sustained by a robust supplier base. Preliminary planning includes a potential FY13 RFP release, FY14 Full and Open Competitive Source Selection, and FY15 contract award with start of production NLT FY18. Acceleration of contract award into FY14 may occur if funding is available. At this time the effort is being planned as an Air Force activity; however, the possibility of a joint Air Force and Navy modernization effort is being considered.</p>
<p>4. The FMU-152A/B was designed as a multi-delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible system for use with General Purpose blast/fragmentation and hardened target penetrator warheads, with cockpit selectable in-flight (prior to release) capability when used with MIL-STD-1760 compliant weapons. The current fuze is an electro-mechanical fuze; however, the Government is open to any technologies that may be available and viable to meet program requirements. Many of the technologies used in the current FMU-152 Electro-Mechanical Safe and Arm Design (EMSAD) are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence, manufacturability and component supplier base. The focus of this effort is to modernize the fuze design to support improved long-term manufacturability; it is not a requirements or capability improvement-driven effort.</p>
<p>5. Following are the key performance requirements under consideration for the modernized fuze. Current FMU-152A/B System Performance Specification (SPS) requirements and capabilities will generally be maintained, with some modification possible to accommodate changes in weapon system Concept of Operations and technologies as noted below. Potential differences with the current SPS are noted in italics. <br />a. Form and fit compatible with inventory warheads to include MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-113, BLU-117, BLU-121, BLU-122, BLU-126 and BLU-129.<br />b. Compatibility (physical, electrical, and logical) with guidance assemblies of the JDAM family (GBU-31, 32, 38, &amp; 54) and the Paveway family (GBU-10, 12, 24, 27, &amp; 28) of guidance kits.<br />c. Fuze will be powered by a bomb fuze initiator and meet the requirements of MIL-STD-1316F. A FZU will be provided by the contractor with each fuze as part of the contract. Design information on the current initiator (FZU-63/B) can be made available; however, it will be the contractor's responsibility to deliver an initiator qualified to meet the power requirements of the new fuze. <em>If the decision for a joint program is made, the fuze system performance specification may be adjusted to accommodate Navy unique initiator requirements (i.e., Fuze Function Control Set compatibility). <br /></em>d. Fuze will be capable of being carried by and launched from the following aircraft platforms: A-10C, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22A, F-35A, B-1B, B-2A, B-52H and MQ-9. <em>If the decision for a joint program is made, the system performance specification will be adjusted to accommodate AV-8B, F-18C/D/E/F, and F-35 B/C.<br /></em>e. Fuze will provide airburst capability through integration with the DSU-33 proximity sensor and provide selective control to inhibit the airburst function. <br />f. The current fuze is designed for 100 hours external and 200 hours internal captive carriage life. <em>The Government is interested in increasing captive carriage life to as much as 900 hours external and/or internal. Final SPS captive carriage requirements may be influenced by industry inputs as requested below. <br /></em>g. Fuze captive carriage and launch environment (altitude and airspeed) will be compatible with the JDAM and Paveway-series weapon systems on identified aircraft platforms (listed in 5d above).<br />h. Fuze will be capable of detonating with non-hardened target impact angles and velocities of the GBU-31(MK-84, BLU-117), GBU-32(MK-83, BLU-110), GBU-38/54 (MK-82, BLU-111, BLU-126, BLU-129), and GBU-10/12/16/24/27(with associated GP warhead). <br />i. Hardened target capability will be <em>10,000 psi reinforced concrete (threshold) (objective = 15,000 psi reinforced concrete).</em> The range of hardened target impact angles and velocities is the terminal operating velocity of the GBU-28 and GBU-31 (BLU-109) weapons.<br /><em>j. The Government is interested in increasing fuze survivability from a single target layer to multiple layers. This is a survivability capability and not a layer/void counting capability. Final SPS survivability requirements may be influenced by industry inputs as requested below.<br /></em>k. Fuze will be capable of being programmed through the aircraft cockpit, as well as through manual settings on the fuze face. This will be a Key Performance Parameter.<br />l. Fuze will have function time delays from instantaneous, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 90, 180, 240 ms; 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes; 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours. <br />m. Fuze will allow for setting arm times from 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 14, 21, 25 seconds for low drag and 2, 2.6, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 seconds with lockout for high drag. <br />n. Fuze will be capable of initiating all current insensitive munitions (IM) explosives and be IM compliant. <em>This may include a change from current PBXN-7 booster if there is one better suited for current IM explosive detonation sensitivity.<br /></em>o. Fuze will be designed to meet the USAF safety requirements and standards <em>(and Navy standards if joint program is pursued).<br /></em>p. Operational service life will be 10 years minimum, with a combined storage and service life of 20 years minimum.<br />q. Fuze system (RFMU*RFZU*Rcomponents=Rfuze system) will provide a threshold reliability of 0.95, minimum, with an objective of 0.98, when employed following operational service life. <br />r. Fuze system production rates should be able to range from 200/month to 2000+/month, with a broad Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) band to support average unit production cost stability given fluctuations in funding.</p>
<p>6. RFI responses will be used by the Government to refine the project's estimated cost, schedule and technical risk assessment to support a high confidence program plan and strategy. RFI responses are requested to include the following:<br />a. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule to complete necessary design, development, qualification and test activities and reach production readiness.<br />b. Expected Critical Technologies and state of technology (i.e., Technology and Manufacturing Readiness Levels) at contract award. Provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts that support your technology and manufacturing assessments.<br />c. Discuss whether an Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD), EMSAD or other design might be proposed. <br />d. Specifically address how the following requirements under consideration are cost, schedule, technology, and/or manufacturing drivers and provide recommendations to reduce program impact. Note any additional drivers not listed below. <br />i. Navy Fuze Function Control Set<br />ii. Increased captive carriage hours<br />iii. Increasing hard target strength from 5,000 psi to 10,000 psi reinforced concrete<br />iv. Increasing fuze survivability from single layer to multi-layer targets<br />v. Long function time delays up to 24 hours<br />e. Whether there are other system requirements or program planning aspects not stated above that significantly impact cost, schedule or technical risk of successfully achieving an affordable and reliable production design.<br />f. ROM estimate of the quantity range for the most efficient EOQ bands and associated production unit cost for the delivered fuze system (fuze, FZU, closure ring, cable, container). If the Modernized Commodity Fuze effort is not funded, provide inputs on the industrial base capability to continue to supply mechanical and electro-explosive components over the long-term.<br />g. ROM for technical data package and/or license rights suitable for any potential follow-on production competition.</p>
<p>7. If requested, a Technical Data Package (TDP) containing the current Interface Control Documents and SPS for the FMU-152A/B and accessories will be made available to qualified respondents for reference only. Respondents must officially request the documents in writing. To validate the documentation release, this request must include the company name, mailing address, email address, point of contact, phone number, current CAGE number and Central Contractor Registration number. The written request must include acknowledgement of the Responder's responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations. For any foreign firm, the request must include proof of a current and applicable approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act if applicable. Upon verification of status and acknowledgement of responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations, approved authorization confirmation to receive the requested documents will be provided.</p>
<p>8. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. AFLCMC/EBDZ uses manpower technical support contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, only qualified sources will be considered for award
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR 52.209-1.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALFICATION.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 11/27/12. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: MEGGITT (NORTH HOLLYWOOD), INC (79318). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<p>FROM: TO:<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp; 50<br />51&nbsp;&nbsp; - 100<br />101 - 150<br />151 - 200<br />201 - 250</p>
<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG06EA09C with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for flight operations and science analyses of the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.  CSC is currently performing LEND safety and health oversight for the LEND instrument, including engineering parameter review and trending, as well as participating in the science operations which includes initiating all commands to the instrument and planning all instrument modes and turn-ons. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to CSC.  The estimated period of performance of this firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract extension will be for 2-years from March 16, 2013 through March 15, 2015.  CSC is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:	1) CSC possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the LEND instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to carry out the calibration and operations in a combined manner in which scientific operations and the flight operations can be merged;  2) CSC personnel are unique in their familiarity with the LEND instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft since the company was a key part of the team which designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the LEND instrument for the LRO spacecraft, including at the spacecraft level after delivery to LRO; 3) CSC scientists have helped lead the effort in the community to analyze the data products from the LEND instrument, and current LEND team members are the only organization with the capability to carry out the combined scientific and instrument operations. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement. Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 29, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to SwRI.  The estimated period of performance of this cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract extension will be for 2-years from March 16, 2013 through March 15, 2015.  SwRI is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:	1) Only SwRI possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed design, test and operation knowledge of the LAMP instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to integrate the science operations and science data analysis including targeting;  2) SwRI scientists and engineers are unique in their familiarity with the LAMP instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft since the organization designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the LAMP instrument for the LRO spacecraft, including at the spacecraft level after delivery to LRO; 3) SwRI has developed unique software for: testing the instrument on-orbit, generating calibration target selection, checking telemetry received for health and safety of the  LAMP instrument, processing the raw scientific data in order for scientist to be able to manipulate, display, and analyze it and producing summary data. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement. Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.

The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Design Phase Services and three (3) options for Construction Phase Services. These options include: Option 1 - Capital Security Upgrades; Option 2 - Fire Alarm Upgrades; and Option 3 - Passenger Elevator Replacement.
<p><br />The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. The objective of the Source Selection Process is to select a proposal that represents the best value to the Government. The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering the technical factors and the evaluated price. For this procurement, the technical factors with be significantly more important than price (FAR 15.101-1, Trade Offs). The technical factors will include: Experience in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services; Project Management Plan/ Approach; Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel; and Past Performance in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services on similar projects.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if appropriate.</p>
<p>The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.

<p>Project Summary: The objective for this project is to create a solution for capital security improvements based on the deficiencies analyzed in the Capital Security Study Executive Summary - Concept Solution A completed by the U.S. District Courts on April 17, 2012. This solution will include site work, construction of a new sallyport and prisoner elevator, parking and building entry renovations, and circulation zoning/control improvements. The main goals for this project include resolving line of site issues from adjacent structures by acquiring property and demolishing existing residential units, and securing separate, dedicated entry and circulation paths for judges, prisoners, and the public to improve the safety for all the tenants in the building. This project also includes two upgrades to the building systems: replacement of the fire alarm and replacement of the passenger elevator.</p>

The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to: evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.</p>
<p>There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services. There are three (3) options for the Construction Phase Services. The Contractor is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price set forth in the Contract Price Schedule. If the Government exercises the option(s) for the Construction Phase Services, the contractor shall complete the Construction Phase Services at or below the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).</p>

<p><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Current SATCOM Earth Terminal (ET) communications are implemented using an analog architecture, with conversion from digital data to analog signal occurring in the modem. CERDEC STCD initiated a technology development program, Future Advanced SATCOM Technologies (FAST), in FY 12. The FAST architecture moves the analog portion of the ET architecture closer to the antenna, and implements a number of formerly analog functions using a digital architecture. The concept is to digitize the full receive spectrum at Intermediate Frequency (IF) and digitally process to provide separate digital interfaces to the modems. The full spectrum IF uplink will be converted to analog for input to the block upconverter. The implementation of an all digital terminal can bring significant additional capabilities to the control architecture which are unavailable today with the current ET design. The digital signal processor function can provide information about the individual carriers and the overall receive downlink bandwidth which is not resident in the Control, Monitor, and Alarm (CMA) subsystem of the current terminal population.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The US Army Communications Electronics Research &amp; Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space &amp; Terrestrial Communications Directorate (STCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of wideband military satellite communications systems, real time/embedded systems, spectrum monitoring solutions, and link power control solutions. CERDEC STCD is interested in developing an embedded spectrum monitoring and power control solution which leverages the all-digital SATCOM terminal.</p>
<p>The specific scope of this effort is to identify potential approaches to designing and developing a Digital Spectrum Monitoring and Control System and a Digital Power Control System for use over military wideband satellite systems. Digital Spectrum Monitoring and Control should include a full downlink spectrum availability at any control location for enhanced trouble shooting and payload management. Digital Power Control should effectively and efficiently manage links by adjusting power in real time based on changing conditions. Show how these systems leverage an all digital IF SATCOM terminal and provide feedback on digital terminal architecture and high speed interfaces. <br /><br /><strong>DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>CERDEC STCD requests industry provide the following, but not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>General<br /></strong>&bull; Statement of interest. <br />&bull; Description of qualification: demonstrated products, projects, and applicable experience. State whether your current experience is in design, development or both. <br />&bull; Description of existing or planned work in this area. <br /><br /><strong>For any clarifications or questions regarding reference documents or RFI, contact POC.</strong></p>
<p>The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of the requested information. This request does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal Responses to this RFI/SS. Notices are due to by <strong>COB 29 Nov 12</strong>.

<p>U.S. Army CERDEC S&amp;TCD is interested in receiving whitepapers for design, development, integration, and demonstration of an ultra-wideband antenna system installed on a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV), such that it is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the vehicles on the roadway.</p>
<p>The technology will be developed and demonstrated under the FY13 S&amp;TCD technology based program Antenna Research, Reduction, and Compatibility (ARRC). The objective is to develop an effective antenna system, compatible with current Army radio systems, utilizing native vehicle structures and/or standard vehicle accessories for the design and mounting of radiating elements. The effort will involve the design of multiple antenna elements (or the integration of commercial off the shelf (COTS) antenna products), as well as systems engineering to maintain compatibility with the existing radio systems installed on an SUV.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Antenna System Attributes: <br /></strong>- The installed antenna system must not be easily identifiable. Designs utilizing native vehicle structures and accessories are highly desirable and preferred over non-standard vehicle items. <br />- The antenna system installation shall require minimum or no modifications to the SUV. <br />- The antenna system shall be compatible with a fielded Army radio system, and provide performance comparable to existing fielded antennas (see proceeding section). <br />- The antenna system must not subject vehicle occupants to dangerous levels of electromagnetic radiation, and shall comply with established Army exposure safety standards. <br />- The antenna system shall be capable of operating under established MIL-STD-810G environmental and weather conditions, such as operational temperature, shock, vibration, and etc...</p>
<p><strong>Technical Specifications:<br /></strong>The radio consists of multiple RF ports, as denoted in Table 1. It is desired that the proposed solution addresses the requirements for each port on this system. However, at a minimum the proposed solution must address ports labeled with a priority of "required," as listed in Table 1. Furthermore, objective (desired) and threshold (minimum acceptable) requirements are provided for many of antenna requirements specified at each port. If the proposed system does not meet the threshold or objective specifications, a detailed trade-off analysis should be presented along with the whitepaper.<br /><br />It is acceptable to propose multiple solutions, while identifying trade-offs for each possible approach. For example, one solution might utilize multiple radiators connected to a single output port through a diplexer/RF combiner. In such a case, the proposal shall address the technical feasibility and potential impact to the system utilizing such components. If vehicle functionality is impacted by the proposed solution, a risk assessment analysis shall be provided. The Offeror must prove and document their claims by the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) programs or other reliable methods.</p>

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />1.0 Description</strong>
<p>1.1 The CECOM-LCMC Contracting Center is seeking information to determine the existence of sources capable of providing technical services in support of U.S. Army CERDEC/S&amp;TCD research on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technologies.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>As the Warfighter increasingly engages enemies in suburban and urban environments, the Warfighter, more than ever, needs a reliable and robust means of communication that overcome the inherent multipath effects and the environmental interference including unintentional, intentional, and self-interference. MIMO technologies have been attractive in wireless communications due to the ability to improve communication performance in rich-scattering environments, which are detrimental to traditional single-antenna systems. In contrast with traditional communication systems, which are equipped with a single transmit and receive antenna and thus called Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) systems, MIMO systems are equipped with multiple transmit and/or receive antennas. The use of multiple antennas and signal processing provides the means for simultaneous transmissions and receptions and spatial redundancy that help MIMO improving communication performance over SISO. In addition, the use of multiple antennas provides a means for interference mitigation, beamforming, and beamnulling and thus improves the radio anti-jamming capability and low probability of intercept (LPI) / low probability of detection (LPD) capability, which are very important in military operations.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>The S&amp;TCD is interested in receiving white papers for the design, development, implementation, test and evaluation of advanced MIMO algorithms and techniques that can be used to enhance the performance of the current Army communication waveforms and systems. The objectives are to enable space, air, ground, dismounted and unattended platforms mission effective LOS/BLOS communications in complex terrains such as rural and urban operational environments for multi-mission tasks (i.e. communications and electronic warfare operating simultaneously on the same platform).</p>
<p>It is envisioned that these MIMO technologies will improve communication link reliability and throughput and provide spectrum efficiency over the existing single-antenna Army waveforms. These technologies also provide anti-jamming capability in the receive mode and a low probability of intercept (LPI) / low probability of detection (LPD) in the transmit mode.<br /><br />Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, spatial diversity, spatial multiplexing, beamforming, beamnulling, spatial filtering algorithms, and also cross-layer MIMO algorithms. Interested responders are encouraged to submit white papers providing descriptions of emerging MIMO technologies with relevant applications and insertion opportunities to assist S&amp;TCD in identifying areas of "leap ahead" performance enhancements for C4ISR systems.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4.0 Responses</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers are <strong>due no later than 29 November 12 05:00pm EST</strong>. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

In addition to CONUS sites, the same services may be required for operations at locations Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Sources Sought does not commit the United States Government (USG) to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The USG will not pay for any information received in response to this Sources Sought nor will the USG compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the USG. The contractor will be responsible for supporting emplacement, flight operations (launch, flight, and recovery), maintenance and sustainment of up to four JLENS aerostats and associated support equipment, as well as sustainment training, at up to four sites within CONUS. The systems will be operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Emplacement is planned NLT 4QFY14 with operations in support of a COCOM exercise beginning immediately and continuing for a period of at least three years (FY15, FY16, and FY17). Once the systems are initially emplaced, there are no plans to move or relocate them. JLENS Mission The mission of the JLENS is to provide elevated, persistent, Over-The-Horizon (OTH) surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks enabling protection of the US, Allied and Coalition forces, as well as critical geo-political assets from Cruise Missiles and Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBMs), Large Caliber Rockets (LCRs), and Surface Moving Targets (SMTs). JLENS Overview JLENS is a critical part of the Army&rsquo;s future Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture and is a Joint Service interest program. A JLENS &ldquo;Orbit&rdquo; is comprised of two systems: a Fire Control Radar system (FCS) and a Surveillance Radar system (SuS). Each system is comprised of a 74-meter (74M) tethered aerostat with its Mobile Mooring Station (MMS), a Communication and Processing Group (CPG), and associated Ground Support Equipment (GSE). In addition to the components common to both systems cited above, a Surveillance Radar (SuR) is integrated into the SuS and a Fire Control Radar (FCR) is integrated into the FCS. The JLENS mission is achieved by both the SuS and FCS operating as an orbit; however, each system can operate autonomously and contribute to supporting the JLENS mission. See attached briefing depicting the JLENS mission, prime items, systems, and subsystems. The USG requires the contractor to support Soldier-led operations, to include aerostat inflation and launch, flight operations, recovery, and helium replenishment, as necessary. The contractor will also be required to provide all required maintenance and sustainment activities, to include sustainment training in support of the deployed Orbit. The USG requires a team of Field Service Representatives (FSRs) with expertise in the areas of radar and communication system operation sustainment and repair; power generation and distribution; aerostat operation, sustainment and repair; mechanical and electrical maintenance and repair; physical security; and, site sustainment and maintenance. Training materials will be USG furnished. Contractor employees shall be required to have Secret security clearances. Foreign participation is not allowed.

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity (DMA) Contracting Office is seeking sources for the DMA ON-SITE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SERVICES. This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified companies capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is an announcement seeking market information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), the Government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP); however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g., large business, small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519 with a size standard of $25.5 million.
<p>A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a list of Core Competencies the Government feels is essential to successful performance are attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Defense Media Activity and the respondent's potential ability to meet DMA's requirement. The purpose of this notice is to identify interested vendors - large businesses, small businesses, 8(a), Veteran Owned, etc., and to determine if a set-aside is warranted. Responses should speak to the ability to perform the requirements contained in the PWS and provide evidence of successful experience regarding the core competencies.</p>
<p>The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal: (1) Name of company; (2) Name of company's POC, including address, phone, and email; (3) Identify the type of entity (large business, small business, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, 8(a), HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned, etc,), (4) Identify intent to team, and if possible, the anticipated teaming arrangement. Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in the draft Performance Work Statement. Send submittals to: Defense Media Activity-Contracting Office East, ATTN: LEILA MILLER, 6700 Taylor Ave, Fort George Meade, MD 20755 or via email to Leila.Miller@dma.mil. Telephone responses or inquiries will not be accepted. Submittals are requested NO LATER THAN 5 DEC 2012, 2PM (EASTERN).</p>

<CONTACT>Neil Mcavinue, Phone 215-737-3123, Email Neil.Mcavinue@dla.mil
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** <br />The Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support supplies the military Services with nerve agent antidotes during peacetime and wartime. This is a Request for Information (RFI) on current manufacturing capabilities and new technology development for nerve agent antidotes in auto-injectors that might be used in wartime in response to chemical attacks. They could also be used in peacetime.<br />This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.<br /><br />*** OBJECTIVE ***<br />The nerve agent antidote auto-injectors, hereinafter referred to as auto-injectors, are pressure activated devices suitable for intramuscular administration. The unit will contain active drug ingredients (e.g. atropine, pralidoxime, diazepam, etc.) for the purpose of countering the effects of nerve agent poisoning.<br />In wartime, the need for auto-injectors may increase significantly. To meet an increased demand, the existing supply and baseline production capacity of auto-injector devices in the U.S. may need to expand. DLA Troop Support is requesting information on existing and planned manufacturing capabilities for auto-injectors.<br /><br />***CURRENTLY MARKETED DEVICES***<br />If your firm currently markets an auto-injector device, please provide information with respect to the following:<br />a) Place of manufacture<br />b) Estimated annual capacity<br />c) FDA registration (if applicable)<br />d) Product name and description including description of any special features<br />e) Current unit sale price<br />f) Estimated inventory level and storage requirements

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and shall not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources interested and capable of performing the work and obtain their size classification relative to the North American Classification System (NACIS) Code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  

A.	GENERAL INFORMATION 

1.	Title of Project: Pathology and Transportation Services for VA Biorepository (VAB) ALS (CSP 501) and Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (CSP 501B) brain banks.

2.	Scope of Work:
This project requires recovering whole brain, spinal cord (cervical to cauda equina) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from deceased, consented Veterans living throughout the United States. When an enrolled Veteran dies, the organs need to be recovered immediately to be useable for research.  The organs and CSF is packed in wet ice in special shipping containers and shipped by special courier to our biorepository facility. The VAB is looking for service providers to recover these specimens once the location of the veteran is identified.  Many times the time period for notification of these services are identified on short notice due to an unexpected death of a participant. The VAB staff will then coordinate the recovery procedures, including transportation of the body to an appropriate facility, and afterward to the family's chosen funeral home.  VA medical centers are the primary choice for implementing the organ recovery procedure.

The estimated recovery cost per individual can range from $800-$2500, depending on factors including the distance the service provider will need to travel.  

 The death rate in our enrolled cohort is highly variable annually; however, a general estimate would be 40 recoveries per annum. 

3.	Background: The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) manage clinical trials run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The VAB collects CNS (brain and spinal cord) tissue and relevant medical history from Veterans with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Veterans of the Gulf War era across the US in order to provide high quality tissue annotated with relevant clinical data to qualified investigators. VAB staff conducts regular telephone follow-up calls with all enrolled donors and coordinate brain and spinal cord recoveries upon the enrollees' death. Donated organs are shipped via courier to our biorepositories either in Boston or the Southern Arizona Core Tissue Laboratory (SACTL) at the Tucson VA. Due to the precious nature of these organs and the time sensitive nature of shipping requirements, we need pathology and body transportation services in all 50 states 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year with the shortest contract set-up time possible. 


REQUESTED INFORMATION: STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY: Submit a brief description (five [5] pages or less) that shows your company can provide the required services.  One additional page may be included explaining experience in performing these services to the VA, other government agencies, or for private facilities.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This is not a solicitation for quotes, neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI and there will be no contract award from this RFI. There will be no reimbursement for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or follow-up information requests. The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified contractors that provide Actuarial Services, their capabilities, and their size classifications (small business, large business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Women Owned Small Business, etc.). 

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is interested in gathering information for Actuarial Services for the office of the Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) to develop and maintain the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM).  The EHCPM is used to estimate demand for VA health care services and provide insightful, timely projections to inform decision makers responding to a myriad of issues and challenges. The EHCPM produces twenty-year projections of Veteran enrollment, utilization, and expenditures at a very detailed level.  The resulting projections support the development of the VHA medical care budget, strategic and capital planning, and policy analysis.

The EHCPM accounts for the impact of the following on Veteran enrollment and use of VA health care services:
"	Enrollee age, gender, morbidity, and geographic migration patterns
"	Enrollee reliance on VA health care versus other health care providers
"	Enrollee income, local unemployment rates, and travel distance to VA facilities
"	Enrollee transition between enrollment priorities, i.e., movement into service-connected priorities and transitions due to changes in income
"	Unique utilization patterns of OEF/OIF/OND, female, rural, and new enrollees, and specific age cohorts 
"	New policies, regulations, and legislation and changes in the broader environment, such as the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit
"	VA health care initiatives, such as the mental health capacity improvement initiative
"	A continually evolving VA health care system, i.e., quality and efficiency initiatives
"	Future changes in health care practice and technology.
RESPONSE INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Ms. Beth Davis, betha.davis@va.gov.  Each RFI response will receive a confirmation email; if a confirmation is not received please call 202-271-2597. Please include a point of contact, company name, business size standard, phone number, e-mail address and website information in your response to the RFI.

Responses must be received by this office on or before 3:00 PM ET on 20 November 2012. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information. 

The response should describe the company's capability to provide actuarial services and any subcontract intentions for the above scope of work and a transition/migration process from the incumbent contractor.  If unable to meet all the requirements the respondent should offer trade-off considerations. Companies are encouraged to submit responses to this RFI, even if each requirement is not met.

<DESC>Request for Proposal (RFP) W52P1J-11-R-0063 is for the operation, maintenance, and modernization of Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) and companion small caliber rifle ammunition.  LCAAP is located in Independence, MO, and is a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) facility for the manufacture, delivery and related services of small caliber rifle ammunition, such as: 5.56mm; 7.62mm; Cal .50; Cal .30, and, Cal .22 in various packaging configurations.  In consideration for exclusive use of the facilities, the operating contractor will provide facilities support (direct and indirect) in accordance with performance work statements (PWSs).  <br><br>This acquisition will be a best value source selection with full and open competition resulting in two contracts, a Facilities contract and a Production contract.  The Production contract will contain a hybrid of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and Requirements Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  The IDIQ CLINs will be for the following cartridges which are currently being competed under the small caliber second source acquisition: DODICs A059 (5.56mm M855 Ball, 10-Round Clip), A062 (5.56mm M855 Ball with M27 link (SAW)), A064 (5.56mm (4) M855 Ball: (1) M856 Tracer with M27 link), A080 (5.56mm M200 Blank, 20-Round Carton), AA33 (5.56mm M855 Ball, 10-Round Clip), AB56 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, linked), AB57 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, 10-Round Clip), AB58 (5.56mm M855A1 Ball, 10-Round Clip), A131 (7.62mm (4) M80 Ball: (1) M62 Tracer with M13 link), A143 (7.62mm M80 Ball with M13 link), A555 (.50 Cal M33 Ball, linked), and A557 (.50 Cal (4) M33 Ball: (1) M17 Tracer, linked).  The Requirements CLINS will include all 5.56mm, 7.62mm, Cal .50, Cal .30 and Cal .22 families of rifle ammunition awarded by the Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) with the exception of the items covered by the aforementioned IDIQ CLINs, as well as pistol ammunition (9mm M882, .45 caliber, .38 caliber, etc.), shotgun ammunition (10- and 12-gauge shot shells, etc.), and .300 Winchester Magnum.  The Government reserves the right not to award any item(s) introduced during the contract which LCAAP does not have the current capability to produce or cannot produce without facilitization (perishable tooling excluded).  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders and delivery order modifications will be utilized to place requirements for small caliber rifle ammunition on the resulting production contract (for both Requirement and IDIQ CLINs).  Award quantities will vary given funding requirements.<br><br>The resultant contracts will have a base period of five years (FY13 - FY17) and two options for a two-year and three-year period (for FY18- FY19 and FY20-FY22 respectively).  Anticipated award date is 1 October 2012.  <br><br>Technical Data Packages (TDPs) for this effort will be available electronically on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO); CD-ROMs will not be available.  All contractors must obtain an FBO vendor account in order to access the TDP.  <br><br>Further information regarding the new process for obtaining TDPs and this procurement in general, to eventually include a draft RFP and any future industry day announcements, will be posted at the following website: http://www.aschq.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/LCAAP.aspx and should be monitored accordingly.  <br><br>Submission Information:  The point of contact is the Contract Specialist, Ms. Jen Paul, e-mail address Jennifer.N.Paul.civ@mail.mil or the Contracting Officer, Ms. Kristin Comer, e-mail address Kristin.L.Comer.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this special notice is to synopsize the Government's intent to sole source and award to WinEstimator, Inc. The sole source will use FAR 6.302-4: Only one responsible coerced and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 USC 2304(c)(1) (Brand Name Justification).</p>
<p>In compliance with requirements published in AR 420-10 and DA PAM 420-06 (App D); "approved Engineered Performance Standards (EPS) are to be used for all planning, scheduling and measuring the performance of Real Property Maintenance work". The construction industry engineering performance standards guide developed by "RS Means" has been formatted by "WinEstimator" to meet DOD requirements. The US Army Center for Public Works are so convinced of the reliability of the WinEstimator product that it keeps renewing three (3) free licenses for DPW at Fort McCoy each year. Taking the lead from the Army action, the DPW at Fort McCoy uses the program and has a need for a new base plus four option supply contract for an additional nine (9) WinEstimator licenses, for DPW planners. The cited authority is applicable, because it is necessary for DPW at Fort McCoy to maintain continuity of planning software systems.</p>

<DESC>NASA announces the upcoming Common Instrument Interface (CII) Guidelines Working Meeting, scheduled for December 13, 2012, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the James E. Webb Auditorium at NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street, SW, Washington, DC. The purpose of the Working Meeting is to discuss technical aspects of hosting NASA science instruments and technology demonstration payloads on civil and commercial spacecraft.  The principal organizations participating in the Working Meeting are the Earth Science Division (ESD) of the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) Program of NASA Space Technology Program Directorate. ESDs flight portfolio includes the Earth System Science Pathfinder Program (ESSP), which comprises a series of relatively low-to-moderate cost; small-to-medium sized; competitively selected; Principal Investigator-led missions that are built, tested, and launched in a short time interval that accommodate new and emergent scientific priorities.  The Earth Venture Instrument (EVI) line of missions is ESSPs hosted payload component.  The Common Instrument Interface (CII) Project supports ESSP by identifying a common set of technical guidelines for Earth Science instruments that will improve their success of becoming hosted payloads. The TDM Program bridges the gap between proof of concept and experimental testing stage and the final infusion of the technologies into NASA missions, providing needed flight demonstration in relevant environments to mature laboratory-proven technologies to flight-ready status.  It focuses on technologies with strong customer interest that meet the needs of NASA and industry by enabling new missions or greatly enhancing existing missions. TDM is currently developing two hosted payload missions: the Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) and the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD). This Working Meeting focuses on the technical issues of NASA hosted payloads, specifically the CII deliverables as they apply to Low Earth Orbit and Geostationary Earth Orbit.   This days agenda includes discussion of the CII Guidelines document, the Hosted Payload Opportunity database, and the Hosted Payload Operational Concept documents, and its objective is to obtain feedback on the CII deliverables from industry, science, and technology leaders. The Working Meeting is open to the public. One day before the Common Instrument Interface working meeting, on December 12, 2012, the Hosted Payload Alliance (HPA) is hosting a Working Meeting from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the James E. Webb Auditorium at NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street, SW, Washington, DC, the same location as the CII meeting. The Hosted Payload Alliance is a satellite industry alliance whose purpose is to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites. This meeting focuses on the policy and business issues concerning the commercial hosting of government payloads.  Organized as a series of moderator-led panel discussions, the agenda includes: the planning and decision process; mission-dependent architectural considerations; procurement practices, acquisition models, and contracting guidelines; policy enablers and inhibitors; and the path forward for hosted payloads. NASA is not affiliated with the HPA, but is providing the facilities for this meeting to facilitate this mutually beneficial and productive discussion. Requests for further information and questions may be addressed to: Mitra Dutta, Earth Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20546; Phone: 202-358-4579; E-mail: sanghamitra.b.dutta@nasa.gov; Fax 202/358-3098.

<DESC>KSC Centerwide Fire Monitoring Project PCN 98574 AWARDED 09/24/2010. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION This document is a justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) prepared by the NASA, John F. Kennedy Space Center. Contracting Activity National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) OP-CS Kennedy Space Center, FL  32899 Description of the Action - This justification provides the rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition for the acquisition of additional center-wide fire monitoring services under existing contract NNK10CA67C with Simplex Grinnell. Additional information is on the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC), see below. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION This document is a justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) prepared by the NASA, John F. Kennedy Space Center. 1.      Contracting Activity        National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)        Kennedy Space Center (KSC)        OP-CS        Kennedy Space Center, FL  32899 2.  Description of the Action - This justification provides the rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition for the acquisition of additional center-wide fire monitoring services under existing contract NNK10CA67C with Simplex Grinnell. 3.  Description of Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs - The scope of work under this contract modification includes hardware and software modifications to existing Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm control panels (FACP's) to complete the conversion of 65 facilities to KSC's new Central Radio Monitoring System (CRMS).  The project will also remove the obsolete and proprietary Simplex-Grinnell Central Fire Monitoring System (CFMS).  The additional work requires installing, modifying, re-programming, and testing of the fire alarm control panels and installation of CRMS subscriber unit reporting radio equipment at each facility.  Once this work is completed all KSC facility fire alarm panels will report to the newly installed CRMS system.  The vast majority of work in this contract modification was originally included as options in the original procurement, but not awarded due to funding limitations. The original contract NNK10CA67C scope of work included new CRMS head end fire monitoring installation and acceptance testing at the Launch Control Center, Central Implementation Facility, and the Fire Alarm Shop; the transfer of the existing facility subscriber unit reporting radios at various locations to the new head end equipment; demolition of the existing CRMS head end equipment at facility K6-2496; and modification of the facility K6-2496 fire alarm system.  This contract was awarded on September 23, 2010, in the amount of $3,592, 739.   Considerable other work in the bid package priced as options was not awarded due to funding limitations.  The work not awarded included the connection of KSC facilities, the vast majority containing Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm panels, to the CRMS monitoring system by Simplex-Grinnell under an approved justification for other than full and open competition. On January 13, 2011 Modification 2 to contract NNK10CA67C was issued in the amount of $1,637, 735 bringing the contract value to $5,230,474, and extending the contract performance period from 395 days to 730 days.   This work was awarded using an approved justification for other than full and open competition and included hardware and software modifications to existing Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm control panels at the Vehicle Assembly Building (K6-848), Vehicle Assembly Building Repeater Facility (VABR), and the Communications Distribution and Switching Center (CD&SC) to allow the transfer of approximately 60 additional existing KSC facilities to the new CRMS monitoring system installed under the NNK10CA67C base contract.  This work is currently in progress. The original contract and modification 2 did not include 65 remaining facilities with Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm panels that need to be connected to the new CRMS system. This contract action provides for the remaining work to complete facility connections to the CRMS system and removal of the obsolete CFMS system.  The estimated total value of this work is $3,963,000 and will extend the contract performance period an additional seven hundred thirty (730) days. 4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition - The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Simplex-Grinnell is the original equipment manufacturer of KSC's existing FACPs and CFMS and, due to proprietary communication protocols, the only contractor capable of properly modifying and reprogramming their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS. 5.  Nature of Acquisition Requiring Other Than Full and Open Competition  - The CFMS and most existing FACPs use Simplex-Grinnell developed software and are interconnected on networks (mini-networks) using Simplex-Grinnell proprietary communication protocols; this includes the systems being modified under the additional Center-wide fire monitoring services described in this JOFOC.  Simplex-Grinnell hardware and the associated software are proprietary products designed to provide communications for fire alarm signal reporting purposes.  The Government has neither the rights nor the data necessary to allow any other vendor to properly modify the Simplex-Grinnell software and programs associated with the Simplex-Grinnell CFMS, mini-networks, or FACPs.  Simplex-Grinnell develops and distributes the software associated with Simplex Fire Alarm Systems and is the only contractor capable of properly modifying their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS. This sole source Simplex-Grinnell support represents approximately 80% or $3,170,400 of the total estimated value of $3,963,000 for the proposed additional work.  The remaining work is general construction work incidental to the CRMS effort. 6.  Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable -  This proposed action will be publicized in NAIS/EPS and FBO in accordance with the requirements of FAR 5.201(b)(ii) and FAR 6.305. 7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost - KSC will evaluate Simplex-Grinnell's proposed prices for price reasonableness and realism to ascertain if the proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed and reflect an understanding of the work requirements.  The proposed prices will be primarily evaluated by comparison against the Government estimate.  KSC will also evaluate proposed labor and indirect rates against the labor and indirect rates covered under contract GS-07F-0396M, a General Services Administration  contract under which Simplex-Grinnell provides commercial fire alarm system services. 8.  Market Research - A sources sought synopsis was issued on October 28, 2009 to determine if there were small disadvantaged veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone firms, or 8(a) firms capable of performing the Repair of the KSC Center -wide Fire Monitoring System project.  Firms in these categories having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed KSC's requirements were invited to submit capability packages for review.  No firms fitting these categories submitted responses demonstrating the capability of performing KSC's work and concurrence was received from the Small Business Administration to procure this acquisition as a full and open competition allowing proposals from both large and small businesses.  The synopsis for the original contract NNK10CA67C which included the majority of this additive work as a potential option was publicized on the NASA Internet Acquisition Service (NAIS) and the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on May 14, 2010 and the solicitation was issued on June 1, 2010.  The solicitation consisted of a base bid and seven options.  A JOFOC, similar to this one, was posted with the solicitation identifying Simplex-Grinnell as the original equipment manufacturer of KSC's existing FACPs and CFMS and, due to proprietary communication protocols, the only contractor capable of properly modifying and reprogramming their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS.  The Simplex-Grinnell sole source effort comprised approximately 40.5% of the total base bid and options work. The Government anticipated multiple bids on the original solicitation based on numerous questions received from industry, the well-attended pre-bid site visit, and Simplex-Grinnell's announcement at the pre-bid site visit that it was bidding as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor to other firms. Only one bid was received and it was from Simplex-Grinnell, a large firm located in Orlando, Florida.  The additional work covered by this JOFOC is essentially the same as the options included but not awarded under contract NNK10CA67C.  Simplex-Grinnell was the only firm to submit a bid for the original full and open solicitation which had an estimated 40.5% Simplex-Grinnell sole source effort spread across the base bid and seven options.  It is not anticipated that a new solicitation for the additional central fire monitoring work covered under this JOFOC will result in more advantageous bids from other firms especially since the total estimated value of this additional work that must be performed by Simplex-Grinnell has increased to 80%. 9.  Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition - The additional work under this action requires significant installation and/or major modifications of Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm control equipment and software.  Though it is estimated that 80% of the total work must be performed by Simplex-Grinnell, the Simplex-Grinnell work and the other work must be integrated and performed together. The other 20% of work could be performed by an electrical subcontractor certified by the manufacturer to install the radio transmitters required at KSC, who is also capable of performing the minor low voltage work to provide power to the radio transmitters.  If Simplex-Grinnell does not perform this work as a prime contractor, it will perform the work as a subcontractor, with the Government having to pay prime contractor mark-ups on 80% of this work, an extra cost burden with no added benefits to the Government. Simplex-Grinnell has an existing contract for Center-wide fire monitoring work that this additional work can be added to via bilateral contract modification resulting in project management and cost efficiencies.  The contractor is already fully mobilized, eliminating additional mobilization costs and minimizing the potential for delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.  Costs will be negotiated with Simplex-Grinnell as a prime contractor.  Acquisition costs associated with the development of additional sets of specifications, drawings, and other contract documents will be minimized by adding this work to the existing contract.  Additionally, the time required in requesting a proposal, evaluating it, and issuing a contract modification under an existing contract is substantially shorter than soliciting a new requirement, evaluating proposals, and making a new and separate contract award. 10.  Listing of Sources, if any, that Expressed Interest in the Acquisition - Contract NNK10CA67C Simplex-Grinnell was the only source who provided a proposal in response to the June 01, 2010 solicitation for the acquisition of additional center-wide fire monitoring services containing the same requirements as described in this JOFOC.  No other sources have expressed an interest in the acquisition of the additional work described in this JOFOC. 11.  Statement of  Actions to Remove/Overcome any Barriers to Competition - A significant quantity of Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm equipment is currently installed in KSC facilities in support of the existing CFMS.  Contract NNK10CA67C transfers connections from the existing CFMS to the new CRMS.  It also removes the proprietary Simplex-Grinnell CFMS system, allowing other facility fire alarm systems to be connected to the new CRMS radio units. The installation of an upgraded CRMS eliminates the need to connect most new fire alarm panels to Simplex-Grinnell proprietary networks and will substantially reduce future barriers to free and open competition.  Fire alarm systems will no longer have to be sole sourced to Simplex-Grinnell and can be procured by free and open competition; as in the current KSC's Central Campus and Consolidated Data Center projects. Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for KSC Center Wide Fire Monitoring System - Modification to NNK10CA67C Contracting Officer's Technical Representative:      I certify that the supporting data presented in this justification are                                        accurate and complete.

This contract action provides for the remaining work to complete facility connections to the CRMS system and removal of the obsolete CFMS system.  The estimated total value of this work is $3,963,000 and will extend the contract performance period an additional seven hundred thirty (730) days. 4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition - The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Simplex-Grinnell is the original equipment manufacturer of KSC's existing FACPs and CFMS and, due to proprietary communication protocols, the only contractor capable of properly modifying and reprogramming their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS. 5.  Nature of Acquisition Requiring Other Than Full and Open Competition  - The CFMS and most existing FACPs use Simplex-Grinnell developed software and are interconnected on networks (mini-networks) using Simplex-Grinnell proprietary communication protocols; this includes the systems being modified under the additional Center-wide fire monitoring services described in this JOFOC.  Simplex-Grinnell hardware and the associated software are proprietary products designed to provide communications for fire alarm signal reporting purposes.  The Government has neither the rights nor the data necessary to allow any other vendor to properly modify the Simplex-Grinnell software and programs associated with the Simplex-Grinnell CFMS, mini-networks, or FACPs.  Simplex-Grinnell develops and distributes the software associated with Simplex Fire Alarm Systems and is the only contractor capable of properly modifying their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS. This sole source Simplex-Grinnell support represents approximately 80% or $3,170,400 of the total estimated value of $3,963,000 for the proposed additional work.  The remaining work is general construction work incidental to the CRMS effort. 6.  Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable -  This proposed action will be publicized in NAIS/EPS and FBO in accordance with the requirements of FAR 5.201(b)(ii) and FAR 6.305. 7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost - KSC will evaluate Simplex-Grinnell's proposed prices for price reasonableness and realism to ascertain if the proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed and reflect an understanding of the work requirements.  The proposed prices will be primarily evaluated by comparison against the Government estimate.  KSC will also evaluate proposed labor and indirect rates against the labor and indirect rates covered under contract GS-07F-0396M, a General Services Administration  contract under which Simplex-Grinnell provides commercial fire alarm system services. 8.  Market Research - A sources sought synopsis was issued on October 28, 2009 to determine if there were small disadvantaged veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone firms, or 8(a) firms capable of performing the Repair of the KSC Center -wide Fire Monitoring System project.  Firms in these categories having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed KSC's requirements were invited to submit capability packages for review.  No firms fitting these categories submitted responses demonstrating the capability of performing KSC's work and concurrence was received from the Small Business Administration to procure this acquisition as a full and open competition allowing proposals from both large and small businesses.  The synopsis for the original contract NNK10CA67C which included the majority of this additive work as a potential option was publicized on the NASA Internet Acquisition Service (NAIS) and the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on May 14, 2010 and the solicitation was issued on June 1, 2010.  The solicitation consisted of a base bid and seven options.  A JOFOC, similar to this one, was posted with the solicitation identifying Simplex-Grinnell as the original equipment manufacturer of KSC's existing FACPs and CFMS and, due to proprietary communication protocols, the only contractor capable of properly modifying and reprogramming their proprietary software and hardware to accommodate the transfer of fire reporting to the new CRMS.  The Simplex-Grinnell sole source effort comprised approximately 40.5% of the total base bid and options work. The Government anticipated multiple bids on the original solicitation based on numerous questions received from industry, the well-attended pre-bid site visit, and Simplex-Grinnell's announcement at the pre-bid site visit that it was bidding as a prime contractor and as a subcontractor to other firms. Only one bid was received and it was from Simplex-Grinnell, a large firm located in Orlando, Florida.  The additional work covered by this JOFOC is essentially the same as the options included but not awarded under contract NNK10CA67C.  Simplex-Grinnell was the only firm to submit a bid for the original full and open solicitation which had an estimated 40.5% Simplex-Grinnell sole source effort spread across the base bid and seven options.  It is not anticipated that a new solicitation for the additional central fire monitoring work covered under this JOFOC will result in more advantageous bids from other firms especially since the total estimated value of this additional work that must be performed by Simplex-Grinnell has increased to 80%. 9.  Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition - The additional work under this action requires significant installation and/or major modifications of Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm control equipment and software.  Though it is estimated that 80% of the total work must be performed by Simplex-Grinnell, the Simplex-Grinnell work and the other work must be integrated and performed together. The other 20% of work could be performed by an electrical subcontractor certified by the manufacturer to install the radio transmitters required at KSC, who is also capable of performing the minor low voltage work to provide power to the radio transmitters.  If Simplex-Grinnell does not perform this work as a prime contractor, it will perform the work as a subcontractor, with the Government having to pay prime contractor mark-ups on 80% of this work, an extra cost burden with no added benefits to the Government. Simplex-Grinnell has an existing contract for Center-wide fire monitoring work that this additional work can be added to via bilateral contract modification resulting in project management and cost efficiencies.  The contractor is already fully mobilized, eliminating additional mobilization costs and minimizing the potential for delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.  Costs will be negotiated with Simplex-Grinnell as a prime contractor.  Acquisition costs associated with the development of additional sets of specifications, drawings, and other contract documents will be minimized by adding this work to the existing contract.  Additionally, the time required in requesting a proposal, evaluating it, and issuing a contract modification under an existing contract is substantially shorter than soliciting a new requirement, evaluating proposals, and making a new and separate contract award. 10.  Listing of Sources, if any, that Expressed Interest in the Acquisition - Contract NNK10CA67C Simplex-Grinnell was the only source who provided a proposal in response to the June 01, 2010 solicitation for the acquisition of additional center-wide fire monitoring services containing the same requirements as described in this JOFOC.  No other sources have expressed an interest in the acquisition of the additional work described in this JOFOC. 11.  Statement of  Actions to Remove/Overcome any Barriers to Competition - A significant quantity of Simplex-Grinnell fire alarm equipment is currently installed in KSC facilities in support of the existing CFMS.  Contract NNK10CA67C transfers connections from the existing CFMS to the new CRMS.  It also removes the proprietary Simplex-Grinnell CFMS system, allowing other facility fire alarm systems to be connected to the new CRMS radio units. The installation of an upgraded CRMS eliminates the need to connect most new fire alarm panels to Simplex-Grinnell proprietary networks and will substantially reduce future barriers to free and open competition.  Fire alarm systems will no longer have to be sole sourced to Simplex-Grinnell and can be procured by free and open competition; as in the current KSC's Central Campus and Consolidated Data Center projects. Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for KSC Center Wide Fire Monitoring System - Modification to NNK10CA67C Contracting Officer's Technical Representative:      I certify that the supporting data presented in this justification are                                        accurate and complete.

<RESPDATE>111912
<CONTACT>Patrick C. Martinez, Phone 2023146247, Email Patrick.Martinez@NTSB.gov
<DESC><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency with the primary mission of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation-railroad, highway, marine, and pipeline-and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p>The NTSB has a requirement for telecommunications support for telephone service at the NTSB Headquarters located at 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20594. This requirement is conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)-Soliciting from a single source. The NTSB intends to issue a non-competitive award to QWEST Corporation located at 1600 Bell Plaza, Seattle, WA 98191-0001. The period of performance of this requirement is from October 1, 2012 - September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>Qwest currently provides this service via existing Qwest data lines. The technical risk would be significant if the NTSB were to change contractors for this requirement. If the NTSB were to change contractors, there could be loss of service to both the NTSB and many of its clientele during a transition as new data lines are installed and configured. These are telecommunications circuits which, in many cases, use hard-coded sending and receiving software. The cost to change contractors and to recode software would not be cost effective or in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p>Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice must include the following: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and/or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These capability statements shall be no greater than 5 pages plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included.</p>
<p>The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submission. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Parties must submit information within five (5) days of publication of this notice. The NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiry will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to <a href="mailto:Patrick.Martinez@ntsb.gov">Patrick.Martinez@ntsb.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is not a solicitation and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. Furthermore, the receipt of this RFI and or submission of a response confer no rights upon the vendor nor obligate the Government in any manner.<br />The Department of State (DoS) Bureau of Administration, Office of Operations, General Services Management, Fleet Management and Operations Division (FMO) is performing a market research and study to determine small business interest and capabilities for providing support for its Fleet Management and Operations Division Acquisition Planning.<br />This RFI is organized into the following sections:<br />1. Background<br />2. Objective<br />3. Contract Requirements<br />4. Instructions<br />5. Questions<br />6. Closing Date<br />7. Disclaimers<br />BACKGROUND<br />The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Administration, Office of Operations, General Services Management, Fleet Management and Operations Division (FMO) is responsible for providing quality and professional group transportation services on a regular scheduled and non regular scheduled basis for the Department of State employees within the Washington, DC Metropolitan area. <br />OBJECTIVE<br />DoS is conducting a study to ascertain if it is economically feasible to source out the recurring round trip shuttle bus services to operate shuttle transportation services for the FMO in support of DOS employees and DOS's authorized official visitors. The U.S. Department of State, FMO has a projected continuing requirement for Shuttle service shall consist of providing one type of shuttle services- general shuttles that serve all DOS employees. The general shuttle service comprises of four (4) separate shuttle routes between the headquarters building and various annexes in the Washington, DC area. The shuttle bus routes are: 1) HST/NFATC Route, 2) HST/ROSSLYN Route, 3) SA-44-Route, and 4) RRB-SA-44 Route. For these services FMO currently uses 12 buses, ranging in size from 22- to 45 passengers. In all, FMO's general shuttles provide several thousand passengers per year.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />The study will determine the feasibility of a contractor to be responsible for complete operation of the shuttle service routes, to include providing drivers, motor vehicles (buses), fuel, motor oil, antifreeze, labor to perform required maintenance, and similar items needed to fulfill the department needs. In addition, the Contractor must either possess a Security Clearance recognized by the DOS, have had a recently completed National Agency Check (NAC) acceptable to the DOS, or be personally interviewed by the Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and have a NAC initiated. DOS will issue building passes only to US citizen employees of the Contractor.</p>
<p>All shuttles buses will operate Monday through Friday; service is needed between the hours of 6:49 AM-5:55 PM (last shuttle service), every work day and excluding Federal holidays. The vendor shall have the capability to operate all four of the shuttle service routes based on a 252-workday year. The vendor shall not provide service on any day that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announces on its website (www.opm.gov) that the federal offices in the DC Area are closed for the entire day. If OPM closes federal offices in the DC area after the start of the work day, the vendor shall continue providing shuttle services through the end of the schedule, unless or until release by the Contracting Officer (CO) or Contracting Officer Representative (COR). If OPM announces a delayed opening, the vendor is required to begin provision of services on time, in accordance with the schedule, unless notified in advance of an authorized delayed start by the CO or COR. Understanding the necessity for the vendor to dedicate operators and equipment to this function, the vendor will be paid the full amount specified in the prices schedule for the calendar month, regardless of any closures by OPM on regular work days in that month. In the event it becomes necessary to calculate an incremental rate (e.g. hourly, daily or weekly) for adjustment purposes, the hourly rate specified will be utilized, and applied to a basic work day of eight (8) hours and a basic work week of forty (40) hours. <br />General Shuttles</p>
<p>HST/NFATC Route. Service will interconnect the DOS's Harry S. Truman (HST) Building located at 2201 C Street, NW, DC with the Rosslyn stops located at 1550 Clarendon Boulevard and 1300 Wilson Boulevard and the National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC) located at 4000 Arlington Boulevard, Arlington, VA via a single circuitous trip.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System intends to negotiate a short term sole source contract with Rozene Development International, LLC, 2323 South 171st Street STE 202, Omaha, NE, 68130-4651, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   Only one responsible source will meet the immediate needs for Seven Community Based Outreach Clinics (CBOC) and One Medical Center within the Nebraska Western - Iowa Health Care System.  The locations are: Bellevue CBOC (NE), Grand Island CBOC (NE), Holdrege CBOC (NE), Lincoln CBOC (NE), Norfolk CBOC (NE), North Platte CBOC (NE), Shenandoah (IA) CBOC, and the VA Med Center located in Omaha, NE.    

This is notice of intent to award a short term sole source under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Note - No award will be issued from responses to this notice. Response to this notice does not legally bind the government in any manner. Your concerns will be considered if you respond to this posting with a similar product/service.  

The justification for this sole source request is based on the Nebraska Western Iowa HCS maintaining their telework services currently being performed at eight locations in order to ensure that veteran patient needs are being met in preparation for both medical and surgical appointments and procedures.  Rozene Development International already has trained and credentialed employees that can fulfill this need on a short term basis until a long term contractual arrangement can be competitively solicited.        
  
All quotes received by 2:00 P.M. Central Time, November 30, 2012, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This acquisition is under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This announcement constitutes only the solicitation. There will be no guaranteed minimum quantities purchased and the Government will be obligated only to the extent of authorized calls placed against the resulting Agreement(s). All contractors who provide offers must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). You may register via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or contact SAM at 1-866-606-8220. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339113, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement is put forth as a full and open competition.<br />The Government intends to award one or more Blanket Purchase Agreement(s); however, the Government reserves the right not to award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. Any resultant BPA(s) will be five (5) years in duration; however, either party may terminate the resulting BPA with 30 calendar days notice.<br />Purpose: The purpose of this request for quote is to establish Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) for up to three (3) different manufacturer product lines for Orthopedic Implants that will provide the listed items for trauma plating systems and intramedullary (IM) nails at 60TH MDG.<br />Duration: The intended duration of the resulting Agreement(s) are anticipated to be up to five (5) years; however, either party may cancel the Agreement(s) with 30 days written notice.<br />Product Line: It is the Government's intent that each resulting BPA will include a manufacturer product line for both trauma plating systems and IM nails. These shall include those necessary for the treatment of fractures of the appendicular skeleton, pelvis and sacrum. All items within a product line must be included in the quote(s). The intended scope of the resulting Agreement(s) includes all current and future product line items. The vendor shall submit offers that include pricing for both product lines. The Government recognizes that the market is not static and that it will need to have access to state-of-the-art technology. Therefore, in addition to the items initially agreed upon, the scope of the Agreement(s) includes all items which become available during the course of the performance. New or modified items within the awarded product line may be added to or deleted from the Agreement(s) at a later date by a Contracting Officer in accordance with the paragraph entitled, "Technology Refresh."<br />Description of agreement: The contractor will provide the following under the scope of this BPA:<br />Orthopedic Trauma (Excluding Spine) Plating Systems - Locking and non-locking plating systems, with periarticular options that range in size from those used for phalanx fractures to long bone fractures and all related supplies. These systems shall be exclusive of those used for spinal fractures. <br />Orthopedic Trauma IM Nails - Femoral, Tibial and Humerus intramedullary nails and all related accessories for successful implantation of the devices. <br />Purchase limitation: The dollar limit for each call shall be $100,000.00 for a warranted Contracting Officer. 60TH MDG personnel will have individual dollar limits as established in writing to the contractor with the Contracting Officer's signature. <br />On-Site Personnel Requirement: The technical representative will provide advisory assistance to 60TH MDG physician in implantation of the devices. He or she will provide technical information of the contractor's products, perform standard implant testing of the devices, and provide trouble-shooting assistance. Technical support will be available twenty four (24) hours a day for patient follow up, in-service training, and consultation on technical issues. Contractor must return telephone calls for assistance from 60TH MDG within 30 minutes of 60TH MDG's telephone call to the contractor. <br />Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other Regulatory Agencies Recall: At the time of the award of the Agreement, the vendor(s) will not have any outstanding actions from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or unresolved FDA warning letters on the manufacturing processes or quality control issues involving the products covered by this solicitation. The Government will require proof from the vendor that any FDA issues have been resolved. A letter to the contractor from the regulatory agency will meet this requirement. <br />Technology Refresh: <br />A. All implants, instruments, and accessories offered shall be state-of-the-art technology. "State-of-the-art" is defined as the most recently designed components which are announced for marketing purposes, available, maintained and supported in accordance with requirements specified in the solicitation. Components and products with a manufacturer's planned obsolescence within the first year of contract award are not acceptable. <br />B. If upgrades of instruments, implants, or supplies become available after establishment of this Agreement, the contractor will substitute them for the initial items per Item C below.<br />C. The contractor will provide to the contracting officer the following information:<br />(1) A list of specific initial items which shall be updated.<br />(2) Product literature for the new items and a detailed description of the differences between the initial items and the new items, and a specific analysis of the comparative advantages/ disadvantages of the items involved. <br />D. The Contracting Officer will provide the information to 60TH MDG for approval. Upon approval, this Agreement will be modified to acknowledge the updated items.<br />E. All new products that replace initial items and released to the market during the term of the contract will be made available to the Government at a discount price agreed to based on commercial sales practices disclosure. If pricing for new products is unacceptable, medical centers will continue to use current products on Agreement and contractor will be required to continue to supply the contracted item. <br />F. All other new products that are added to a vendor's catalog and released to the market during the term of the Agreement will be made available to the Government at a discount price agreed to based on commercial sales practices disclosure. Pricing on new technologies will be negotiated separately.<br />Delivery Requirements: The successful contractors shall provide two delivery methods. 60TH MDG will either order in the "Just-in-Time" manner or will use the "Consignment Agreement". Regardless of the method chosen by the medical center, instrument sets must be provided. The purpose of the two delivery systems is to meet the needs of 60TH MDG. All product deliveries shall go through the Medical Logistics office at 101 Bodin Cr. Bldg 777, Travis AFB, CA 94535, regardless of whether they are JIT or Consignment. <br />Instrumentation Sets: Upon written notification from the medical center for the Consignment<br />Agreement delivery method, the contractor shall furnish one instrument set that will stay at 60TH MDG, and a set will be available for just-in-time procedures. To accommodate surgery scheduling additional sets (loaner sets) may be needed and will be made available upon mutual agreement between 60TH MDG and contractor.

<p>DLA Energy is requesting competitive proposals for a PPA Ground Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Array for U.S. Army Garrison Fort Detrick, located in Frederick, Maryland. The project scope includes approximately 80 acres at the facility location. Minimum array size is 10 MWs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and incidentals required to produce and deliver solar electric power, to include all renewable energy attributes, to Fort Detrick via contractor-owned and operated Solar Electric Services (SES) project. The contractor is responsible for providing an interconnection agreement, maintenance, and ancillary services to properly deliver the power to the point of common coupling throughout the contract. The Government will purchase the power output from the SES, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), via a long term contract under a firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>DLA Energy plans to solicit this requirement under the authority provided by 10 USC 2922(a), which grants military installations authority to enter into contracts for periods up to 30 years for the provision and operation of energy production facilities on real property under the Secretary's jurisdiction, or on private property, and the purchase of energy produced from such facilities.</p>
<p>The solicitation is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) and has incorporated provisions and clauses as in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-61. Additional requirements may be added by Amendment. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.

Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three (3) years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical approach portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates three WP-3 Lockheed Orion aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these WP-3 Lockheed Orion aircraft will be based out of the Halifax, Canada area to be operated in support of critical winter storm/ocean wind related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Halifax area, it is necessary that the P-3 aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period January 9, 2013 through February 11, 2013. The hangar will protect the aircraft and it's instrumentation from the environment as well as protects the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />NOAA WP-3 Orion aircraft will be operating out of Halifax, Canada in support of winter storms/ocean winds research. There will be several NOAA WP-3 mechanics in Halifax supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one P-3 will be required in the hangar.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) WP-3 Lockheed Orion having a wing span of 100 feet, length 116 feet and 39 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that<br />The hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security Clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) AC and DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and out of hangar.<br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft. x 5 ft.,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from January 9, 2013 through February 11, 2013. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than February 11 , 2013. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<DESC>CURE BREAKWATER National Park Service Denver Major Acquisitions Buying Office (MABO) Lakewood, Colorado 80228 11/14/2012
This is Amendment # 2 to Solicitation Q1379130007. The purpose of this Amendment is to note a second set of questions, and responses for questions that arose either at the site visit or as may have been presented up to the date of this Amendment posting.   Please see amendment # 1, for the initial set of questions and responses that included questions that were presented at the site visit.
All offers are due 11/21/2012, therefore any questions presented after this amendment # 2, will likely not have adequate time for response for offer consideration.  


QUESTIONS WITH RESPONSES.  
1)   Stevens Creek Wave Attenuator must be attached to shore.  Why is this requirement and the purpose served.
Response:  The Wave Attenuator needs to be attached to shore to allow the flexibility in the breakwater as the reservoir level rises and falls.
2)  IOLA Wave attenuator seems to require two anchoring systems, one for high water and one for low water.  Does this suggest that the wave attenuator is actually disengaged from the high water mooring system, moved to the low water mooring system, and then attached to the low water system, and vice versa, and how far is the move?
Response:  Due to topography of the IOLA location and the effects of the wind and ice, the NPS anticipates the need for two mooring locations.  The move is approximately 200 to 300 feet.  
3)  Will the inshore ends of both wave attenuators set on the lake bottom, above the water line, at times of water level variation?
Response:  Likely, dependent upon water leveyel.
If so, how much of each Wave Attenuator sits on the lake bottom at times of Extreme high water (presumably zero percent), how much sits on the lake bottom at times of minus 35 feet, and at what water level does each in shore end first come to rest on the lake bottom for each Wave Attenuator?
Response:  At high water, zero.  At low water, it is unknown.  The offeror is responsible to investigate the existing conditions and determine for themselves, how much of the Wave Attenuator will rest on the ground at low water.  This would vary amongst varying types of attenuators.  The wave attenuator is expected to be able to be moved closer away/from the shore as the water level rises and falls.  However, there will be some of the wave attenuator rest on the ground when the reservoir level is at some point below full pool.  That level is unknown and will likely vary.  4)  Please describe the scope of the wave attenuators being moved around as this would impact the mooring system.
Response:  The NPS staff moves the wave attenuators towards/away from shore as the lake level rises and falls.  In the winter, the attenuators may be moved closer to shore to minimize the action of ice, wind , and flowing ice and allowed to freeze in the lake.  The attenuators need to be capable of resting on exposed lake bottom at lower water levels without damage to the attenuator. 
5)  Is there additional information about the sand/gravel lake bottom such as depth of sand and gravel over the solid bedrock?
Response:  We do not have additional information for this specific information at this time.  A site visit was conducted in which it was recommended for interested parties to examine the site conditions.  At this time the reservoir is at its lowest level in past twelve years, resulting in a higher amount of exposed shore line.  
6)  If the wave attenuator hits the ground and cannot be moved because of low water will this fail your specific requirements? 
Response:  per specifications; The contractor shall supply a wave attenuator capable of being grounded and moved along the ground without damage to the attenuator.  The attenuator shall be capable of withstanding axial movement as a result of the attenuator being grounded at lower water levels. The attenuator must have the capability of being able to be moved around, as needed to maximize protection to the boat launch ramps. (reference SOW section 15)   It is the purpose of the Source Selection Evaluation Board to evaluate all submitted offers to determine which offer will be considered the best value to the government.  All offers will be evaluated per the source selection criteria that are provided in the solicitation and the requirements specified in the Statement of Work.  All offers will be evaluated in strict conformance to those criteria.  
7)  Is the lake bottom flat and level?  
Response:  No, both areas vary, reservoir bottoms are unknown.  However, at low water the areas appear to have a combination of rock, mud  and varying angles of slope.
 8)  Do you plan on taking out and moving onshore the wave Attenuator anytime?
Response:   not planning on moving it other than keeping up with the water level as the reservoir empties and fills. 
Have you in the past to work on? 
Response:  No, Maintenance on system should be minor other than winch system maintenance, which would not require removal.  
9)  Would an ALL Concrete Structure meet all your requirements?
Response:   It is the purpose of the Source Selection Evaluation Board to evaluate all submitted offers to determine which offer will be considered the best value to the government.  All offers will be evaluated per the source selection criteria that are provided in the solicitation and the requirements specified in the Statement of Work.  All offers will be evaluated in strict conformance to those criteria.  Reference the criteria stated in the solicitation document and the SOW.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 01
<p>AFLCMC/EBDZ will host a Modernized Commodity Fuze Industry Day at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 14-15 November 2012. Only companies deemed eligible to receive the Technical Data Package (see Paragraph 7 of the RFI) may attend. A general information session will convene at 0800 Central Standard Time, 14 November in the Eglin Conference Center and is expected to last about 2 hours. Following this session, the government will meet with companies individually upon request. The purpose of these individual breakout meetings is to allow for discussion of company proprietary or sensitive materials or concerns. Any questions coming out of these information exchanges may, at the government's discretion, be sanitized and provided along with answers to all Industry Day attendees afterward.</p>
<p>Companies interested in attending the MCF Industry Day must provide notification NLT 1500 CT, Thursday, 25 October, to Mr. Erik Urban at erik.urban@eglin.af.mil and Ms. Trisha Brinton at trisha.brinton@eglin.af.mil. If a one-on-one session with the government is desired, include that request as part of the notification. Because individual sessions must be scheduled in advance, they will only be available to those companies requesting them prior to the deadline. Following receipt of notification from companies, the government will provide information about base access requirements and, if requested, scheduled time for the one-on-one. Attendance will be limited to no more than 5 people per company. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS INDUSTRY DAY OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>Clarification to paragraph 5c: Release of MIL-STD-1316F has been delayed with no estimate of release date, thus a version cannot be supplied at this time. Please revert to the latest published version "E" and be advised of the Air Force and Navy safety communities' intent to reinstate the requirement for a visual safe /arm indication for an electromechanical fuze (a major purpose for version "F" of the standard). A discussion of this requirement will be provided during the Industry Day general session.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 02 TO THE RFI ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2012<br />ADDITIONAL MCF QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY<br /><br />1. The government's need for a modernized fuze is based on an assumption that the industrial supplier base will not be able to provide affordable, high quality components for the current Electro-mechanical design over the long-term (20+ years). What is your perspective on this assumption? <br /><br />2. General Industry consensus is there would be a substantial cost increase if the captive carry requirement is changed from 100 external/200 internal to 900 hours. What does industry consider a reasonable captive carriage hour requirement that optimizes cost/schedule impact? Does the fuze or the FZU design drive the extended captive carriage costs/schedule, or both equally?<br /><br />3. If the government deleted the long function delay time requirement, explain to what extent that would lower your development and production costs?<br /><br />4. If the government eliminated the FFCS requirement, how would that impact your projected cost and schedule for developing the fuze?<br /><br />5. Considering the need for affordability, at what quantity (or quantities) would sharp increases in unit price begin to occur? Why? What strategies are there to lessen these increases?<br /><br />6. As part of the acquisition strategy, the government is considering options to include testing of the performance of prototype fuze systems as part of the source selection process. This could either be part of the basic proposal evaluation, or it could involve a rolling down select to 2-3 suppliers for a 12-18 month demonstration effort to a final downselect. Key evaluations points will be current FMU-152A/B specification performance with hardened target capability and multi-layer survivability. How long would it take you to provide 10 test items for evaluation? What would be the ROM cost for those test items?<br /><br />7. What are your thoughts on industrial base impacts of a joint modernization program with the Navy; versus two separate programs, Air Force and Navy?<br />

<DESC>THIS NOTICE SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUSLY ISSUED NOTICES FOR SOLICITATION # HQ0276-12-R-0001.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to conduct an other than full and open competition (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy Agency requirements). The Government intends to conduct a limited competition among Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for the design, product development and initial production of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block (Blk) IIB Missiles. Other potential offerors (prime contractors only) will need to respond within 30 days from posting date with their intent to propose and provide a capability statement demonstrating prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense missiles; experience in land and/or sea-based missile system integration; and demonstrated missile production and sustainment capability. The Government intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 for limited competition.<br />For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the final solicitation will be released in the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, with a contract award in the second quarter of FY 2015. At this time, there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to award to United States (U.S.) owned companies only. The Government is considering awarding two (2) contracts through a Preliminary Design Review, at which time one (1) contractor will be selected for further development and testing.
<p>The MDA is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System and integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the U.S., friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 Blk IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2022 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U.S. homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. homeland. The SM-3 Blk IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 Blk IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 Blk IIB will be launched using engage on remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance network. The SM-3 Blk IIB is required to be both land and sea compliant and is targeted for incorporation into Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4.<br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria has been developed to guide prospective offeror(s) as to the priorities applied to the evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.<br />1. ICBM defense performance*<br />1.1. Defended area of U.S. homeland<br />1.2. Launch area denied<br />1.3. Level of protection <br />1.4. Maximize Government-defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture<br />1.5.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide construction for a structural stabilization and repairs to Berth 1, 2A, and 2B at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME.  Stabilization of the existing 1100 linear feet of granite block quaywall will be accomplished by construction of a steel H-pile supported reinforced concrete relieving platform located landside of the existing granite quaywall, and compaction grouting behind and through the quaywall. The project will also remove approximately 1100 LF of abandoned railroad track.  The mooring hardware will be repaired or replaced as necessary to provide adequate capacity for the berthing of submarines, barges, and miscellaneous surface vessels.  The deck structure will be repaired to eliminate sinkholes.
  The finish elevation of the pier will be raised by approximately 2 ft and the entire 75,000 square foot area between Berth 1 and berth 2 will be repaved or concrete slabs installed.  Lead paint remediation and asbestos abatement will be required for general site demolition.

<DESC>This is a justification and approval that provides notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-08-D-0005, Packing and Crating Services, for a period of one (1) month not to exceed three (3) months. The current contract expires 31 December 2012 and the services need to continue to ensure uninterruption until the new contract under solicitation FA4610-12-R-0014 is awarded. The period of performance for this extension will be from 01 January 2013 through 31 Mar 2013 for one (1) month and extend longer if required. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This option exercise will be at the current rate specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This option exercise will further allow for the current procurement under FA4610-12-R-0014 to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential contractor. Andersen Van &amp; Storage Inc. is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8 within 10 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise. A determination by the Government to exercise the aforementioned option clause and not compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to exercise the option. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to nancy.perez@us.af.mil and sean.kennedy@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, this announcement constitutes the only solicitation; any offers will be considered; however, it is the Government's intent to award a sole-source purchase order to Gleason Research Associates, Inc.
<p>This procurement is for the purchase of a Auto Scan Tracking System. (ASTS). ASTS has been tailored specifically for the DOD/DA as an end user to interface to PBUSE. ASTS currently fills the gap in capabilities of PBUSE and DPAS, allowing users to manage Hand Receipt data with over 200 fields and the ability to auto populate over 25 standardized DOD forms. ASTS provides organizations with an Enterprise property management solution that allows visibility of all assets in one system. Delivery must be no later than 7 days after date of award and will continue for one year, in order to meet the Army requirements. No other brands will be accepted IAW (FAR) 3.302-1(c)(1). Please see the attached Documents further information.</p>
