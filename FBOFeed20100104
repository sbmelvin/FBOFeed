AMCOM is the only source that can provide these services.  AMCOM 4.0 Upgrade is the only JITC approved ADAS available, and AMCOM does not have partners that provide these maintence services.  Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this service, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to AMCOM for 1 year Post Warranty Annual Maintenance on AMCOM Automated Directory Attendant System (ADAS).

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The performance of this procurement will begin 1 February, 2010 and continue through 31 January, 2011.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541519 with a small business dollar standard of $25,000,000.00. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the maintenance of Automated Directory Attendant Software (ADAS) by 4:00 PM EDT, Tuesday January 19, 2010 to Joshua Bell, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6081, FAX:  717-770-7591, or e-mail:  Joshua.bell@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EDT, Tuesday January 19, 2010 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to AMCOM.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 2-Southwest, is preparing  to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) 20181AR503 on or about February 11, 2010 that will potentially result in award of up to three (3)  individual Construction Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) for the site preparation, construction , installation, and maintenance of various types of shoreline and bank erosion control systems; most commonly installation and construction of wave breaks and breakwaters along the Gulf Inter Coastal Waterway (GIWW) along the Texas Coast.
 Various projects relating to erosion control systems will be required by the government over the next several years that serve  to prevent shoreline and bank erosion along waterways, lakes, canals, bayous, swamps, and tributaries  that serve as boundaries for National Wildlife Refuge's and other lands owned and/or managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service within the states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona.  
Each anticipated contract resulting from the forthcoming solicitation will be general construction and construction related requirements/projects similar, but not limited to:  maintenance, alteration, repair, renovation, demolition, and installation of breakwaters and wave break systems. The majority of work will require the installation of new breakwater systems along several areas along the Texas Coast which includes aggregate, rip-rap, limestone, reinforced concrete, gravel, cast-in-place concrete, and similar systems to control erosion from strong wave action along the Gulf Inter Coastal Water Way (GIWW) and various shorelines and coastal areas.   Alternate systems that utilize non-geologic, unnatural, and/or fabricated plastic, fiberglass, rubber, or similar man-made materials are not desired.  Some projects may require tools and equipment that is capable of being utilized in wet or swampy coastal areas,  and  some areas may be remote with little or no utilities or services available.  The majority of work will require delivery and placement of materials by bucket barge or similar water transportation methods that are capable of operating within shallow rivers, coastal tidal flats, waterways, bayous, swamps, canals, and tributaries.  Skilled labor, transportation, and materials will be required on a task order basis.   Delivery and placement of materials only may be required on a task order basis, but most frequently, skilled labor and equipment will be required to prevent damage to sensitive ecosystems and natural environments.
The anticipated MATOC shall be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts.  Each anticipated award shall run for a base period of one year, and will be inclusive of four optional extension periods of twelve (12) months each period, for a maximum contract term of up to five (5) years per awarded contract.  
A sample Task Order Proposal Request (TOPR) will be issued with the pending solicitation for use in determining offeror capabilites.  Award of a Task Order based on the offerors response to the TOPR is not mandatory, however the Government does retain the right to award the sample task order at it's sole discretion.  Further, the Government retains the right to make multiple awards based on the solicitation, or make no award at all.
Individual construction projects will be executed through the issuance of future Task Orders under the terms of the awarded contracts and each Task Order shall be competed among the selected pool of MATOC awardees. When services are required, the Contracting Officer will issue a Task Order Proposal Request (TOPR) to the list of awarded MATOC Contractors.  
The TOPR will contain, at minimum, the following information:(1)   Detailed description of services required including specifications and applicable drawings.(2)   Clauses unique to the services required that are not inclusive of the awarded MATOC.(3)   Performance period and work location(s).(4)   Restrictions to facility access to include when work may be accomplished.(5)   Applicable wage determination for the project location(s).(6)   Applicable liquidated damages. (7)   Response date for receipt of proposal.(8)   Selection and proposal evaluation criteria.
When proposals are received in response to the task order RFP, the Contracting Officer will evaluate each proposal in accordance with the selection criteria identified in the RFP.  Task order award may be made on unit price, lump sum price, best-value, specified evaluation factors listed within each RFP, or a combination of these factors.
Awarded task orders may vary in size ranging from $2,000.00 to approximately $500,000.00. Most task orders are anticipated to fall in the range of $2,000.00 to $250,000.00, however this amount may vary and is dependent upon the scope, location, and complexity of each requirement.  Task orders issued will be firm-fixed priced, and may include options. Performance and payment bonds or alternate payment protections will be required on a task order basis.
Task orders issued under each MATOC will primarily require performance of work within the State of Texas on lands managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service near the Texas coastline of the Gulf of Mexico; however, performance of work is not solely restricted to these areas, and may include other Government owned and/or managed installations, including areas within the states of New Mexico, Arizona, and Oklahoma in addition to Texas, and may include rivers, tributaries, lakes, streams, retention ponds, canals, bayous, and similar.
The North American Industry Classification Code for this Requirement is: 238990, all other specialty trade contractors with a small business size standard of $33.5M.  The Product Service Code is: Z299, maintenance/repair-alteration/all other.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE FUNDED WITH AMERICAN RECOVERY &amp; REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDS; AS SUCH THE AWARDEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO SPECIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR CLAUSE 52.204-11.<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Alaska Region (AR) is soliciting interest in construction/renovation of the NWS Nome family housing units in Nome, Alaska. Currently, NWS families occupy two 4-plex units. Each 4-plex contains four 3-bedroom dwellings at approximately 1,000 square feet per dwelling. Each 4-plex has an 8" thick reinforced concrete firewall separating each 4-plex into two 2-dwelling units. The existing 4-plexes were constructed in the 1960's, require excessive maintenance, are not properly insulated and do not meet NOAA housing standards. This Nome Family Housing project will convert these two 4-plex units into five dwelling units and five garages on the existing foundations. The dwelling units may be a combination of 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom compatible with NOAA and Alaska Region Housing standards. One of the 4-plexes has a full basement while the other 4-plex has a crawl space under most of the unit with a small basement area which contains a hydronic heat unit and water heaters for both 4-plexes. Structurally, the two 4-plexes are sound but require increased insulation, new roof, increased dwelling sizes relative to standards for 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom dwellings, a second bathroom in 3-bedroom units and garages all on the existing foundations. It will be necessary to phase this work to accommodate parties currently residing in the structures to be renovated. This action will be a 100% small business set-aside as a Design-Build construction/renovation project. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is planned to be released in early January 2010 with proposals due within 45 days (mid February 2010) and contract award by March 30, 2010. Each proposal will be evaluated for the best value concept proposed based on the following criteria provided in descending order of importance: Proposed Design, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, Schedule, and Management Approach. It is determined that price will be considered approximately equal in value to all of the technical factors combined. The total amount available for this project is $2,500,000. The successful bidder will coordinate with the NOAA project team to complete the design, including design reviews at 65%, 95% and final. Construction/renovation should begin in summer of 2010 and be completed no later than the summer of 2011. For contractual questions please contact Jane Cerda at jane.d.cerda@noaa.gov, and for technical questions please contact John Battle at john.e.battle@noaa.gov. <br />HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION: <br />The solicitation for Reference Number NWWG0150-10-03739 Nome Family Housing Renovation, Nome, Alaska, and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) (www.fbo.gov).

               Representative research areas requiring scientific and engineering research expertise for which "white papers" (capability statements) are solicited include:
Topic a:  System Impact Due to Computational Electromagnetic Analyses 
Navy computational electromagnetics is currently used to investigate coupling between various antennas installed on the topside of Navy ships to determine possible electromagnetic interference (EMI), field levels, and coverage/blockage impacts of the antennas due to shipboard structure.  This analysis only takes into account the "front-end" of the system to which the antenna is attached.  What is desired is an understanding of the impact that predicted EMI at the antenna will have on the system to determine what the end-users will encounter.  Although many aspects of this system impact analysis are system specific, research is desired to understand the impact on system level performance using the predicted coupling, field levels, and coverage/blockage analyses.   
Topic b:  Text Data Mining and Network Analysis for the Mitigation of Technology Surprise 
This effort seeks to develop new methodologies that utilized semi-formatted/unformatted data feeds along with network based information in order to mitigate technology surprise. We are specifically interested in new techniques that combined together text data mining approaches/features and network analysis based approaches/features. In addition we are interested in using these combined techniques to improved data visualization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, or classification results.
Topic c: Next Generation of Technologists 
Provide support for developing and maintaining a cadre of active research scientists who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to Naval problems, to promote hiring and development of new scientists, and to encourage collaboration with universities, private industry, and Naval Research Enterprise laboratories, in particular the corporate Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Establish a long-term program to create the next generation of Technologists at Naval R&D centers; generate and sustain the interest and excitement of adolescents in careers in mathematics, physics, engineering and or other sciences, invigorate the science and math curricula, and enhance science and math training for teachers.

Topic d: Data Collection and Development of Computational Models for Biological Systems: 	 NSWCDD is interested in collecting and analyzing data on host-pathogen interactions following exposure to microbes and/or their toxins.  As part of data analysis, NSWCDD is interested in the development of computational models of the exposures.  For example, NSWCDD is interested in experimentally deriving pathogen numbers, growth/death rates, spread kinetics, toxin production, and/or host responses from relevant in vivo and in vitro models.  Depending on which pathogen and host, data could be collected from BAL fluid, blood, lung homogenates, lymph nodes, other tissues relevant to the infection or exposure and relevant in vitro systems.  Exposure routes are primarily via inhalation (aerosol, intratracheal, intranasal) but other routes are also of interest (injection, intravenous, dermal, etc.).  Targeted hosts include rabbits as well as other relevant species depending on the type of pathogen.  Computationally, NSWCDD is interested in developing mathematical models to capture the data and predict subsequent experimental results.  Computational models may include both stochastic and deterministic models.  The ultimate aim of this work is to better predict and describe a host-pathogen interaction, including man, following exposure to pathogens and/or toxins relevant to chemical and biological defense. 
Topic e:  Sensor Technologies Applied To Detection In Foliage Rich Environments
The Navy and Joint Service/Joint Agency community are continually addressing the need to detect personnel and human presence in foliage rich environments.  Sensor technologies applicable to this capability gap include optical, radio frequency, seismic, acoustic, and magnetic, as well as the broad range of measurements and signals intelligence sensing capabilities.  Multiple ongoing efforts in this research area are seeking solutions in the following areas: innovative sensing technologies across the electro-magnetic, acoustic, and seismic spectrum, data fusion and unique data display and presentation techniques with a focus on improving detection probability and human understanding, and data dissemination methods for improving access to all command echelons. 
Topic f: Autonomous Behaviors, Advanced Payloads And Payload Data Processing For Unmanned Vehicles
Research autonomous behaviors for unmanned systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and the application of autonomous behaviors to surface and expeditionary warfare.  Research the application and integration of advanced sensor payloads for unmanned vehicles and data processing for these payloads.   This research is to develop and demonstrate behaviors and integrated payloads that increase the military utility of unmanned vehicles while reducing personnel requirements to operate and field these vehicles.

Topic g: Azimuth Sensing System
There is an urgent need for a system capable of improving targeting accuracy. Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment. Currently only laser designation provides a practical solution to this problem, however, this makes the operator vulnerable to counterattacks. Accurate knowledge of a user location coupled with range, heading, and elevation to target provides a solution where a brief range-finding designation will allow for a targets location to be know well enough to call for a precision strike.
Provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing system for use on man-portable targeting devices such as laser range finders and laser designators. This system shall eliminate well known problems with digital magnetic compasses. This will allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, and while wearing body armor. The system will improve on the accuracy of a digital magnetic compass even in good magnetic environments. Reduce Target Location Error (TLE) to be less than 10m, permitting accurate target location at ranges of 10km from observer to target.
Due to the needs of the user, the system must work inside a building and be small in size. These limitations rule out the use of all current GPS interferometrics and star finder technologies. The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing, however novel ideas are encouraged.
The program goals require objective parameters to be demonstrated within 3 years. The systems characteristic are as follows:
Threshold :a. Man portable fieldable itemb. Less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracy c. Boresightable to optics d. Volume less than 0.1 cu ft e. 6 mils azimuth accuracy f. 5 lbs g. 500 deg/s survivable slew rate (may need recalibration) h. less than 200 sec startup time
Objective:a. Handheld fieldable itemb. less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracy c. Boresightable to optics d. Volume no more than 0.25 cu in e. 1 mils azimuth accuracy f. 0.5 lbs g. 1000 deg/s operational slew rate (without recalibration) h. less than 30 sec startup time

Topic h: Laser Designator Research
The Marine Corps is looking for opportunities to help transition research and lab development to fieldable technologies. This opportunity is limited to the field of handheld laser designation.
Areas of interest include but are not limited to:.	Novel laser technologies.	Novel seeker technologies.	Laser spot imaging technologies.	1.54um or 1.064um wavelength laser and seeker technologies

Topic i:  Laser Designator Modeling and Requirements Definition
The Marine Corps is currently investigating the true requirements needed to mark targets to hand off to airborne laser spot trackers and to laser guided weapons.  While older hard requirements exist, newer systems may not require as much laser energy as previous systems.  
Research is required to assist with the determination of overall system requirements.  The goal is to develop a model that can be used to predict performance of the entire system, including the laser designator, atmosphere including particulates, reflectivity and geometry of the target, the characteristics of the laser spot tracker and laser seekers, and other pertinent data.  This new model must also be validated and verified against existing models and actual field experiments.  The initial goal of this model is to provide both the transmitter (designator) developer and the receiver (Laser Spot Tracker and Weapon Seeker) developer with the required energy on target so that they can develop their systems independently.

Topic j: Lead-Free Electronics
The transition to a Lead-free electronics industry is a global initiative driven by the desire to reduce unwanted toxic materials in the environment and consequently, in the human population. There are a number of directives driving the transition to Lead-free electronics including the European Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, which banned the use of Lead in electronics starting in 2006.  In the past, alloying Tin with Lead was purposefully done to enhance manufacturing and reliability of the electronic assemblies.  Many of the newer Tin based materials, such as pure Tin or Tin alloys, are less resilient to meeting DoD performance demands. The replacement of Lead-bearing alloys with Tin or Tin-based alloys has presented an increased likelihood of failures attributed to weakened solder joints, growth of Tin whiskers, and the development of Tin plague. For instance, the Physics behind the incubation and growth of Tin whiskers is not completely understood.  Even after several years of investigation and many studies, no adequate Lead-free solution has yet been found to prevent Tin whisker formation.  To date researchers have found no true "drop-in" replacement for Lead bearing alloys used in electronic packaging and soldering applications.
Numerous opportunities exist for research inA.	Tin Whisker growth mechanisms and modelsB.	Electronic system risk analysis and modelsC.	Effects of materials and environmental factorsD.	Mitigation steps to reduce impact and effects of lead-free materials.

Topic k:  Electromagnetic Railgun Launcher Development 
The US Navy is pursuing the development of an electromagnetic launcher (also known as a railgun) for long range naval surface fire support. An electromagnetic launcher consists of two parallel electrical conductors called rails, and a moving element, called the armature. Current is passed down one rail, through the armature, and back up the other rail. The interaction between the magnetic field and the current causes the armature to accelerate. This will create high temperature and strong forces in the breech, rails and armatures. In order to develop the Electromagnetic Railgun Launcher, we are working on developing model and simulation tools, and instrumentation that can survive the extreme environment. These tools will help us understand the multiphysics phenomena (dynamics, thermal, electromagnetic, armature to rail interface, etc.) of the launcher and therefore develop a successful system.

Topic l:  Pulsed And High Power Electromagnetic Technologies 
Technologies including electrical energy storage, pulsed power switching, electromagnetic launcher components, compact high-voltage sources, ultra-wideband technology, high power microwave technologies, detectors and sensors, and all associated modeling; and thermally induced material failure mechanisms. Analysis of high heating rate linear and non-linear processes. Additionally, hypersonic technologies to include materials, electronics, test and evaluation assets, and associated modeling and simulation.  Also high speed projectile technologies to include hypersonics, materials, Guidance Navigation & Control (GN&C), and modeling and simulation.

Topic m:  Spatio-Temporal Statistical Methods The ability to exploit the spatial and temporal characteristics of data is becoming more important in DoD applications.  We seek innovative theoretical and methodological approaches for analyzing spatial data, especially when events and measurements also have a time component.  We are interested in research that produces novel techniques for all types of spatial data analysis, including spatial point processes, geostatistics, areal data analysis, and spatial interaction or flow.  Of particular interest are spatio-temporal methods that deal with data that are often messy and missing.
Topic n:  Advanced Quantitative Social Science Research 
Social science is increasingly considered an integral tool in understanding modern threats and challenges to US national interests.  We seek novel theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding and addressing the key strategic issues of our time.  Research proposals can draw upon game theoretic, statistical, agent-based modeling or other quantitative methodologies to help further our understanding of topics relating to global threats and US national security.  Requested studies should draw upon quantitative social science analyses that address current and future challenges of strategic importance to the US with case studies that show specific applications.  Analysis areas include, but are not limited to:  irregular warfare, economic development and stability, building partner capacity, stabilization, transnational organizations, failed states, globalization, conflict and cooperation, and energy security.
Topic o:  Analysis of Evolving and Dynamic Networks 
Methods for identifying common sequences of interactions in networks that change over time would be very useful.  These could be used to increase one's understanding of the network and to predict future interactions.  Also of interest are methods for identifying the most common combination of sequences between nodes.  For example, the first is a series of contacts over time between a pair of nodes in a network, and the second consists of multiple series of contacts between pairs of nodes.  It should be noted that all sequences may be arbitrarily long.
We seek innovative methods for the identification of common sequences and their combinations, as well as the ability to recognize those that are most likely responsible for an outcome or event of interest.  For example, such methods would search for the most common combination of sequences that would end at a time when an event of interest (some outcome) occurs.  Additionally, each extracted combination of sequences would need to be characterized according to its likelihood of occurrence in absolute terms and according to its likelihood of occurrence relative to other combinations.
The goal is to develop and implement promising methods.  Networks of interest could be very large, so computational aspects need to be addressed when developing software tools.  This includes, but in not limited to:  computing platforms, operating systems, computer memory, storage capacity, availability (i.e. open-source) and scalability.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The purpose of this&nbsp;requirement is to acquire a technical solution to address securing data at rest through an encryption solution that provides a simple interface to encrypt user-selected files and facilitates sharing of protected files between HHS Operating Divisions and external business partners. The solution will prevent unauthorized access to data, accidental disclosure as a result of misplaced, misrouted, or stolen digital property, and easily facilitate the transmission of encrypted sensitive files and folders sent via email to internal and external entities. The Government anticipates requiring an enterprise wide licensing solution supporting approximately 120,000 endpoints, (Windows-based operating systems). The solution is expected to be implemented with at least six separate management domains. In addition, approximately 42,000 licenses are needed for MacIntosh computers installed at NIH and FDA.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), located in Cambridge, MA, under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), and FAR Part 6, paragraph 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), intends to contract on a non-competitive basis with The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.  This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.The Volpe Center, in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL).  JHU/APL has developed a prototype engineering tool called the Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) monitoring system for the FAAs Automatic Dependent Surveillance  Broadcast (ADS-B) program.  This tool requires additional development and refinement as new requirements are levied and ADS-B evolves.  The SBS Monitoring System completes an independent performance assessment of the contracted SBS Services for each Service Volume.  It does this by monitoring the SBS products that are being delivered to a Service Delivery Point (SDP) by the service provider.  The SBS Monitoring System will consist of a set of Surveillance Data Acquisition Tools (SDATs) and a Surveillance Monitoring Data Center (SMDC) located at two geographically diverse Service Delivery Points.  Each SDAT will record delivered data, analyze and calculate metrics on the services being delivered, and publish status and results to authorized users using platform independent methods.  The SMDC will provide user authentication services, remote management capabilities, centralized alarm management, and secure access to the analysis results published by each SDAT.Market research did not find any institution or vendor providing an engineering system similar to SBS monitoring system or the system engineering expertise provided by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a request for information to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential sources that may meet Air Force requirements for production of the following Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Block 0 Kit 1 units: approximately seven (7) Receiver-Transmitters Group, OA-9520/TSQ-T10 (previously known as threat emitter units (TEUs)) with Part Number 200532017-1 and NSN: 5895-01-543-4399FD; up to five (5) Tactical Computer Console units, OJ-824/TSQ-T10 (previously known as fixed command and control units (C2Us)) with Part Number 200734626-1 and NSN: 7022-01-552-5382FD; up to five (5) Receiver-Transmitter Control Group, OK-675/TSQ-T10 (previously known as mobile C2Us) with JTE Part Number 200425533-1 and NSN:5895-01-543-4728FD; approximately seven (7) infrared (IR) cameras procured from a source control drawing with JTE Part Number 200425458-1, and related integration (as an integral/incidental part of the JTE unit deliveries) of these JTE Units on typical training ranges. This procurement will also include up to three (3) JTE Wideband Kits (only the Enhanced Threat Capability Kit will be procured with JTE Part Number 684-1000001-01, NSN not assigned as yet) The wideband kit is designed as an interchangeable replacement of the TEU emitter kit #1 and is comprised of a complement of five transmitters and other circuitry required to generate the RF threat signals listed in a classified JTE Signal Definition Document. Site surveys are to be accomplished to characterize and document existing range infrastructure for up to ten (10) training ranges which will host these JTE Block 0 Kit 1 production units. Travel is projected to support preparation and execution of site installation and test as well as Program Management Reviews (PMRs).</p>
<p>The Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) intends to generate a purchase request leading to firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract award for the production of these systems during a production phase that is projected to include a production rate of four (4) fixed CCTs, seven (7) RTGs, and three (3) wideband kits per year over a production period planned to be five (5) years in duration. The infrastructure effort may utilize a pricing arrangement other than FFP. This contract will utilize a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, each ordering period will consist of 365 days after award of contract (ARO). A responding company must provide rationale if a fixed-type pricing arrangement is deemed inappropriate for their production approach. The contract award may be against a new contract, an existing delivery order contract, and/or an existing delivery order. <br />This request for information is for production of high-fidelity systems that will be deployed on Air Force and Navy major large force exercise ranges, and primary training ranges to include Electronic Scoring Sites . This advanced threat training environment will match actual combat conditions as closely as possible in the type, density, deployment, and employment of anticipated threats. The JTE Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband Kit provide dispersed threat signals to aircrews during simulated penetrations of hostile airspace for surveillance and bombing runs, for the purpose of aircrew tactics and electronic combat training. JTE uses an automatic tracking capability to acquire an aircraft and execute computer-controlled, user re-programmable threat scenarios. JTE is or could be deployed at improved (e.g. graded roads and concrete pad) and unimproved (e.g. no roads, no pad - literally anywhere on a range) sites. JTE complements existing threat simulators/real threats deployed on test and training ranges by emulating signals which simulate the latest and most advanced air defense threat radars.</p>
<p>Delivered/integrated JTE units/systems must meet the complete requirements in the JTE System Performance Specification .The units/systems must also meet all of the detailed data and software specifications that the Government does not possess and all of the data and software specifications that the government can't release due to lack of rights (see next paragraph). Delivered Wideband Kits must meet the complete and exact design requirements of what is being delivered under contract FA8217-07-C-0046 (under which Amherst Systems, Inc/Cage Code 1L4J7 is performing as the prime contractor) including all of the detailed data and software specifications that the Government does not possess and all of the data and software specifications that the government can't release due to lack of rights.</p>
<p>The government does not have a competitive bid package for this procurement. The threat emitter unit signal generator (CEESIM) software/hardware is an example of technical data (for both the Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband TEU configurations) that the government does not have adequate rights to release to support a competitive bid package. The government also does not have the related subsystem specifications (necessary for production) in their possession to support a competitive bid package. Since the government does not have a competitive bid package for the JTE Block 0 Kit 1 TEU or the JTE Wideband Kit, any interested parties must clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without a competitive bid package from the government. At a minimum, the following is the technical data and software associated with the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 configuration and Wideband Kit that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights:</p>
<p>- Threat emitter unit signal generator (CEESIM) software<br />- Range data integration processor components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Mission situation awareness terminal components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Transmitter controller software</p>
<p>Access to this data is also required to meet the site survey, infrastructure planning/utilization, and integration requirements associated with this effort due to the need to understand fully the structure and timing of the data sent and received via system internal and external interfaces.</p>
<p>This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN security requirements. The corresponding DD254 will be provided as part of the associated solicitation. Contract performance is also expected to involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of any related solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for any related solicitation.</p>
<p>Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the production requirements for JTE Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband Kits hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale to that effect. Each interested entity (that has the capability to meet any specific (or all) of the requirements is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors:</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice (SSN)<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals but a SSN.  This special notice synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of Navy Medicine to conduct Market Research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.<BR><BR>Navy Medicine Research & Development conducts research to enhance Navy Medicines operational readiness and performance when delivering health care.  This effort is to provide comprehensive acquisition life cycle support services related to the American Warfighter as a weapon system in the context of Navy Medicine research.  This includes (1) conducting extramural medical research or intramural (on-site) medical research performed by contractors or (2) rapidly developing prototype infrastructure augmentations necessary to conduct such research.  The former includes medical research areas of interest such as:  biological defense; infectious diseases; combat casualty care; dental and biomedical research; direct energy bioeffects; environmental health; aerospace medicine; undersea medicine; tropical medicine; marrow donor program; medical modeling, simulation, and mission support; warfighter performance; epidemiology and behavioral sciences; and special focus topics such as traumatic brain injury.  The latter includes large-scale research infrastructure needs critical to Navy Medicines continued progress towards its strategic objectives and addresses enterprise or other major research services, capacities, processes (e.g., FDA IND), or facilities that meet the needs of Navy Medicine research efforts.  This infrastructure could be focused on individual investigators or large groups of investigators or on disciplinary or multidisciplinary efforts.  The infrastructure is intended to address the needs of researchers and scholars across the array of scholarly fields represented across Navy Medicine.  Attempts to define what qualifies as research infrastructure will be imperfect and Navy Medicine will no doubt need to exercise judgment in evaluating the eligibility of individual submissions.  Eligible examples may include:  commercial processes (e.g., Contract Research Organizations), manufacturing (e.g., vaccine development), laboratories, major research equipment and technical staff support, repositories (e.g., tissue banking, genome repositories, artifact storage), high-end or unique computing needs (in consonance with Navy CIO direction), support staff/facilities for developing, using or maintaining equipment or laboratories, and research staff for consulting or other services (statistics, surveys, research/analysis design, biological computing).  Examples not eligible are:  new buildings or complete building renovations or infrastructure not related to research.<BR><BR>Currently there are contract holders providing services under Omnibus 1 and 2.  Omnibus 1 was specifically designed for medical research but only for that portion of medical research necessary to complete the mission peculiar to the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) and not all of Navy Medicine.  Omnibus 2 was specifically designed for services in support of NHRC medical research such as fiscal and program management related services and not for all of Navy Medicine.  Neither Omnibus 1 nor 2 addressed the Navy Medicine comprehensive extramural research requirement or the infrastructure necessary to sustain Navy Medicine research.<BR><BR>Companies for profit, laboratories, joint ventures, vaccine manufacturers, Contract Research Organizations, non-profits, and universities are encouraged to respond.  CCR registration is required for awards.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $497 Million, as the ceiling for the entire contract<BR><BR>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government intends a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) to a Full and Open Lot and a Partial Small Business Set-Aside Lot. Individual Task Orders will be competed amongst the ID/IQ awardees within the specific Lot. <BR><BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids, or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. <BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUIRED: Interested offerors should provide a submission via email that includes a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist by the closing date.  Capabilities statements shall not exceed one (1) page and should outline the offerors ability to provide R&D services in the subject areas listed above. The submission must include a company name, address, telephone number, business size*, DUNS number, Federal CAGE Code, and point(s) of contact with an e-mail address, and a description of similar contracts.  * Business size is the average monthly employee count over the last 12 months and the average annual gross revenue (in dollars) over the last three complete accounting years (for all entities of the company, including parent and sibling organizations, independent of NAICS code).<BR><BR>This SSN is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.  <BR><BR>Questions may be FAXed via 407-208-3401.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below. <br />
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognize that it is critical to establish relationships with organizations that encourage and foster communication and information access. A major effort to enhance understanding of information needs, resources, and services began in June 1993 when NLM and the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) cosponsored a conference that brought together users of NIH information resources including health care providers, scientists, information specialists, journalists, and members of the community affected by HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the conference was to review the various HIV/AIDS information services, assess current efforts with respect to needs, and identify additional needs. The resultant recommendations were widely circulated and continue to be utilized for planning and informational purposes. The conference report is available on the NLM AIDS Web Site http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/hiv/nihrpt.pdf.<br />Patients and the affected community want access to the most up-to-date and accurate health information to manage their care and make informed decisions about their health. Health care providers and health educators also need access to the most current information to provide the highest quality of care. Information access disparities exist in many communities that are affected by the digital divide. NLM is committed to assisting community-based organizations in accessing the spectrum of information resources and services that are currently available. <br /><br />As a result of the recommendations made during the conference, the National Library of Medicine issued a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for AIDS Community Information Outreach projects in May of 1994. Between 1995 and 2009, similar solicitations were issued (see http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/aids_cio_projects.html for a list of past award recipients). The goal of the AIDS Community Information Outreach funding is to improve access to HIV/AIDS related health information by patients, the affected community, and their caregivers. NLM has continued to issue this solicitation into the year 2009 and has awarded over 270 organizations with funding in an effort to eliminate disparity of information access in the HIV/AIDS Community.<br /><br />Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of the AIDS Community Information Outreach Project is to design local programs for improving HIV/AIDS health information access for patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers and the general public. Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way meaningful to the target community, and increasing the awareness and utilization of NLM online health and medical resources in the HIV/AIDS Community.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:<br />1. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic AIDS- and other health-related information resources by the organization or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art AIDS-related information tools via the Internet. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information;<br />2. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using HIV/AIDS-related information including the use of online databases and general AIDS information resources in order to improve services and benefit the community. This may include training for the staff of the agency, development of training programs for clients and patrons, training programs for other agencies, etc. ;<br />3. Resource Development: To support an organization to meet the needs of their clients or communities by developing specific educational or informational materials such as culturally or language specific fact sheets, bibliographies, guides or other products; and/ or <br />4. Document Access: Access to HIV/AIDS-related documents and other types of health information. This may include the development of connections with local health sciences libraries to obtain use of their collections, to procure interlibrary loan services, etc.<br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br /><br />It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be between twelve (12) and twenty-four (24) months from the date of award. Awards are anticipated to be made August 1, 2010.<br /><br />Other Important Considerations<br /><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br /><br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following: <br /><br />(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration is seeking sources who can provide Lean Six Sigma Training and Consulting Services who are small business concerns that fall under the $7 million dollar size standard for the 611430 NAICS code. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to ascertain the capabilities of small businesses to perform these services with the intent to issue the forthcoming procurement as a total small business set-aside.
<p>TSA is interested in developing a Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Program Office to design and lead implementation of both the Lean and Six Sigma methodologies to support aggressive improvement objectives set by TSA leadership. The LSS Program Office is responsible for LSS strategic planning with TSA leadership, managing LSS projects, and training and developing experts (Black Belts and Master Black Belts) and Project Leads (Green Belts) to address organizational and operational problems selected and sponsored by Office of Security Operations leadership (Executive Champions / Sponsors). Contractors shall provide Executive / Process Sponsor training for TSA executive and process owners, and provide Master Black Belt, Black Belt, Green Belt, and Instructor Techniques training and related consulting to other TSA personnel at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA and throughout the country. The Contractor shall also provide Lean Six Sigma consulting support for TSA projects as identified by TSA, and for the TSA LSS Program office in areas such as LSS project selection and effectiveness and the achievement of desired savings targets on schedule.</p>
<p>The TSA Lean Six Sigma Program will be self-sustaining within 3 years of contract award, using the third year as a transition from contracting training and consulting to TSA internal-resource training and consulting. TSA expects to have the contractor train approximately 1200 personnel in the next three years. Please see the Draft Statement of Work for a more in-depth description of requirements.</p>
<p>Interested small business concerns having the capabilities to provide these services are requested to submit a capabilities statement (up to 6 pages) that describes your capabilities and past performance history in providing these services of equivalent magnitude.

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement.  This is a source sought notice (SSN) for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought notice, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. 

The Economic Planning and Coordination Division (EPCD) of the U.S. Census Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement for consulting and assistance services in order to maintain and improve coverage of complex multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The Business Register serves as the enumeration list for the economic census and as a sampling frame for economics surveys.  It is also used for the storage of administrative data.  The desired improvements include the improvement and expansion on the 2002 implementation of the redesigned Business Register.  The major objectives of this project focus on more complete and up-to date coverage of complex multi-units; improved representation of multilevel and multidimensional organization hierarchies; the addition of statistical units for subsidiary companies, divisions and other intermediate units; expanded use of Federal administrative records and other alternatives to direct collection; increased effectiveness and reduced burden for the annual Company Organization Survey (COS); improved efficiency for register maintenance operations; and strengthened support for the economic censuses and surveys effort to measure this critical  part of the business population.  The results of this work will support EPCDs maintenance and coverage of the multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The intended contract will have a period of performance of one base year and will include up to four one (1) year option periods.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Standardization for this product line, Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes a full line of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck consisting of soft cervical collars, the Miami cervical collars and the Philadelphia cervical collars.  At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>1.	Soft cervical collars: sizes - small, medium, large, universal, children 6-12yr, and pediatric 2-6yr. <BR>2.	Collar cervical Miami: Jr pediatric, J small, J medium, and J large trachea open and w/chin rest w/pads.<BR>3.	Collar cervical Philadelphia: sizes - small, medium, large w/chin rest trachea open and adjustable strap.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is May 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $103,876.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Orthopedic Soft Goods-Neck product items consisting of the soft cervical collars, the Miami cervical collars and the Philadelphia cervical collars.  <BR>1.	At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>a.	Soft cervical collars: sizes - small, medium, large, universal, children 6-12yr, and pediatric 2-6yr.<BR>b.

Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.

Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line two (2) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within thirty (30) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.  Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a clinical (with patients) setting. The soft cervical collar, the Miami cervical collar, and the Philadelphia cervical collar will be evaluated using the following five clinical/performance criteria.<BR><BR><BR>1. Proper Fit - The cervical collar has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. The proper fit feature will allow stabilization of the injured or diseased body part.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the 			adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Compliance - The application process for the cervical collar is simple for better patient compliance.<BR>		a. The simplicity of use feature will provide for better patient compliance.<BR>b. After educating and demonstrating the proper application of the cervical collar the evaluator will observe the patient putting the collar on himself/herself.<BR>3. Patient Comfort - The cervical collar is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or support is important for patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort  The cervical collar has features to provide comfort to the user.<BR>	a. The product must have features that provide comfort to the patient while 		supporting the injured neck.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the product has functional comfort features allowing the product to be acceptable.<BR>5. Product Material - The cervical collar is durable.<BR>	a. A neck support must be durable due to the possible increase in length of time the patient may be wearing the device.<BR>b.	The evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  Standardization for this product line, Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes a full line of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm consisting of shoulder immobilizers and arm slings.  At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>1.	Shoulder immobilizer abduction in sizes small and medium.<BR>2.	Shoulder immobilizer sling and swathe in sizes small, medium, large and X large.<BR>3.	Arm sling envelope in sizes-small, medium, and large.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is May 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $50,126.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm product items consisting of the soft cervical collars, the Miami cervical collars and the Philadelphia cervical collars.  <BR>1.	At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>a.	Shoulder immobilizer abduction in sizes small and medium.<BR>b.	Shoulder immobilizer sling and swathe in sizes small, medium, large and X large.<BR>c.	Arm sling envelope in sizes-small, medium, and large.<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>1.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>2.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>3.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.

Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process and Pricing Analysis  <BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process  <BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the Europe CPT determined/approved the product samples sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical (patient care) setting.  Requested samples will only include high-volume products.  Based on this determination, the following procedures will apply.  <BR>1.	To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices, the Europe Region TRBO office requires  sample sets from each qualifying vendor to be sent directly to the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail address robert.halliday@us.army.mil or USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 Tri-Service Standardization<BR>Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship product samples / literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send Europe Region TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the Europe Region TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>3.	Vendor will provide, during Phase II, only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation (unused samples will not be returned).<BR>a.	The Orthopedic Soft Goods-Shoulder/Upper Arm samples: 1 of each style/size as stated below per each MTF (8 MTFs) and the TRBO to be provided as follows.<BR>1)	Shoulder immobilizer abduction in size medium.<BR>2)	Shoulder immobilizer sling and swathe in size large.<BR>3)	Arm sling envelope in size large.<BR>b.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The Europe Region TRBO shipping address is stated in item #1 above.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line two (2) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within thirty (30) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.  Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a clinical (with patients) setting. The shoulder immobilizer that keeps the upper arm abducted, the shoulder immobilizer sling and swathe, and the arm sling envelope will be evaluated using the following five clinical/performance criteria.<BR><BR>1. Proper Fit - The shoulder/upper arm device has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. The proper fit feature will allow stabilization of the injured or diseased body part.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the 			adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Compliance - The application process for the shoulder/upper arm device is simple for better patient compliance.<BR>		a. The simplicity of use feature will provide for better patient compliance.<BR>b. After educating and demonstrating the proper application of the shoulder/upper arm soft splint/brace the evaluator will observe the patient putting the device on himself/herself.<BR>3. Patient Comfort - The shoulder/upper arm device is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or support is important for patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort  The shoulder/upper arm device has features to provide comfort to the user.<BR>	a. The product must have features that provide comfort to the patient while 		supporting the injured shoulder/upper arm.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the product	has functional comfort features allowing the product to be acceptable.<BR>5. Product Material - The shoulder/upper arm device is durable.<BR>	a. A shoulder/upper arm support must be durable due to the possible increase in length of time the patient may be wearing the device.		<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the 		material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.    Standardization for this product line, Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes a full line of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow of tennis elbow bands, elbow sleeves and the post-op/range of motion elbow support.  The post-op/range of motion support has hinges that can be lock to the desired position of extension or range of desired motion.  At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>1.	Band tennis elbow in sizes small, medium, large, and/or universal.<BR>2.	Sleeve elbow slip-on in sizes medium and large.<BR>3.	Brace-elbow post-op/range of motion support for the right and left elbow in size universal.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is May 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $38,386.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow product items consisting of tennis elbow bands, elbow sleeves and the post-op/range of motion elbow support.  The post-op/range of motion support has hinges that can be lock to the desired position of extension or range of desired motion.  <BR>1.	At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>a.	Band tennis elbow in sizes small, medium, large, and/or universal.<BR>b.	Sleeve elbow slip-on in sizes medium and large.<BR>c.	Brace-elbow post-op/range of motion support for the right and left elbow in size universal.<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>1.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>2.

The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process and Pricing Analysis  <BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process  <BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the Europe CPT determined/approved the product samples sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical (patient care) setting.  Requested samples will only include high-volume products.  Based on this determination, the following procedures will apply.  <BR>1.	To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices, the Europe Region TRBO office requires  sample sets from each qualifying vendor to be sent directly to the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail address robert.halliday@us.army.mil or USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 Tri-Service Standardization<BR>Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship product samples / literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send Europe Region TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the Europe Region TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>3.	Vendor will provide, during Phase II, only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation (unused samples will not be returned).<BR>a.	The Orthopedic Soft Goods-Elbow samples: 1 of each style/size as stated below per each MTF (8 MTFs) and the TRBO to be provided as follows.<BR>1)	Band tennis elbow in size large with foam lining.<BR>2)	Sleeve elbow slip-on in size medium.<BR>3)	Brace-elbow post-op/range of motion support for right elbow in size universal.<BR>b.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The Europe Region TRBO shipping address is stated in item #1 above.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line two (2) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within thirty (30) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.  Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a clinical (with patients) setting.  The tennis elbow band, the elbow sleeve slip-on, and the post-op/range of motion elbow brace will be evaluated using the following five clinical/performance criteria.<BR><BR>1. Proper Fit - The elbow device has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. The proper fit feature will allow stabilization of the injured or diseased body part.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the 			adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Compliance - The application process for the elbow device is simple for better patient compliance.<BR>		a. The simplicity of use feature will provide for better patient compliance.<BR>b. After educating and demonstrating the proper application of the elbow soft splint/brace the evaluator will observe the patient putting the device on himself/herself.<BR>3. Patient Comfort - The elbow device is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or support is important for patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort  The elbow device has features to provide comfort to the user.<BR>	a. The product must have features that provide comfort to the patient while 		supporting the injured elbow.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the product	has functional comfort features allowing the product to be acceptable.<BR>5. Product Material - The elbow device is durable.<BR>	a. An elbow support must be durable due to the possible increase in length of time the patient may be wearing the device.		<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the 		material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

Support wrist cock-up with thumb hole left/right in sizes small, medium, and large.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Orthopedic Soft Goods-Wrist.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is May 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods-Wrist, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $143,352.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Orthopedic Soft Goods-Wrist product items consisting of tennis elbow bands, elbow sleeves and the post-op/range of motion elbow support.  The post-op/range of motion support has hinges that can be lock to the desired position of extension or range of desired motion.  <BR>1.	At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>a.	Support wrist abducted thumb left/right in sizes medium and large.<BR>b.	Support wrist with thumb hole left/right in sizes medium and large.<BR>c.	Support wrist cock-up with thumb hole left/right in sizes small, medium, and large.<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>1.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>2.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>3.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.

To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices, the Europe Region TRBO office requires  sample sets from each qualifying vendor to be sent directly to the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail address robert.halliday@us.army.mil or USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 Tri-Service Standardization<BR>Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship product samples / literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send Europe Region TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the Europe Region TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>3.	Vendor will provide, during Phase II, only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation (unused samples will not be returned).<BR>a.	The Orthopedic Soft Goods-Wrist samples: 1 of each style/size as stated below per each MTF (8 MTFs) and the TRBO to be provided as follows.<BR>1)	Support wrist abducted thumb for the right wrist in size medium.<BR>2)	Support wrist with thumb-hole for the right wrist in size medium.<BR>3)	Support wrist cock-up with thumb hole for the right wrist in size medium.<BR>b.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The Europe Region TRBO shipping address is stated in item #1 above.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line two (2) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within thirty (30) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.  Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a clinical (with patients) setting.  The wrist support that keeps the thumb abducted, the wrist support with thumb hole, and the cock-up wrist support with thumb hole will be evaluated using the following five clinical/performance criteria.<BR><BR>1. Proper Fit - The wrist support has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. The proper fit feature will allow stabilization of the injured or diseased body part.<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the 			adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Compliance - The application process for the wrist support is simple for better patient compliance.<BR>		a. The simplicity of use feature will provide for better patient compliance.<BR>b. After educating and demonstrating the proper application of the wrist support the evaluator will observe the patient putting the device on himself/herself.<BR>3. Patient Comfort - The wrist support is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or support is important for patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort  The wrist support has features to provide comfort to the user.<BR>	a. The product must have features that provide comfort to the patient while 		supporting the injured wrist.<BR>b. The evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the product	has functional comfort features allowing the product to be acceptable.<BR>5. Product Material - The wrist support is durable.<BR>	a. A wrist support must be durable due to the possible increase in length of time the patient may be wearing the device.		<BR>	b. The evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the 		material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<CONTACT>Shirley Ruiz-Lundgren, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025028060, Email shirley.ruiz@ferc.gov - Heidi R. Muller, Phone 202-502-8643, Email heidi.muller@ferc.gov
<DESC>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain knowledge of financial management solutions that comply with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) initiative. The intent of this announcement is to acquire information from interested parties to assist the FERC in developing an understanding of public and private sector capability, capacity, and experience in supporting the existing requirements of the FMLoB. From this information, the FERC plans to develop an acquisition strategy and procure the required software and services from an OMB designated Federal Government Shared Service Provider (SSP) or commercial vendor. The FERC is seeking to acquire financial management system servicing, but not cross-servicing services. All software and services will be obtained though a forthcoming single public-private competition that will result in the selection of one SSP or one commercial prime-contractor.
<p>The FERC will accept responses to this RFI in the form of two-hour presentations during the week of January 26-28, 2010. Interested parties can reserve a two-hour timeslot by contacting the FERC's Contract Specialist, Shirley Ruiz-Lundgren, at 202-502-8060 or the Director of Procurement, Heidi Muller, at 202-502-8643 no later than January 20, 2010.</p>
<p>Specifically the presentation should highlight your organization's offerings by identifying and distinguishing your financial and acquisition management product(s), system integration services and application hosting services. In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3), the FERC intends to use the information received to better understand the offerings of the Federal Shared Service Providers and determine if commercial providers are available. Upon completion of this knowledge gathering, the FERC anticipates finalizing a Solicitation package, which will contain the following materials:</p>
<p>1. A Request For Quote (RFQ) or Request for proposal (RFP) containing a Statement of Work (SOW), Instructions to Offerors regarding the submission of both Technical and Price Proposals, Evaluation Criteria, information about required operational capability demonstrations, and applicable general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>2. A system requirements document containing the functional and technical requirements, consisting of applicable FSIO requirements and FERC-specific requirements.</p>
<p>Once the Solicitation has been issued, all Offerors, whether from the public or private sector, will have the opportunity to submit a written Technical Proposal and a written Price Proposal. As part of the proposal, FERC will require the Offerors to formally demonstrate their ability to meet the FERC's requirements in key areas through an operational capability demonstration.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the operational capability demonstrations, the FERC will make the final Offeror selection. Selection of the service provider will be conducted in accordance with the OMB's memorandum, Competition Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migrations, dated May 22, 2006, the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance [Version 1], dated September 13, 2006, and applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).</p>
<p>Please note, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is not a Solicitation Announcement for proposals, and no contract shall be awarded from this Announcement. No reimbursement will be made for costs associated with providing information in response to this Announcement or to any follow-up information requests. Hard copies of this notice are not available.</p>

<p>YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees. The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information. Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, OPM regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures. ATF will provide these regulations to the "In-House Team Lead Special Investigators," hereinafter referred to as contractors.</p>
<p>ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators. Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired Federal investigators who have at least three (3) years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations. Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.</p>
<p>The Personnel Security Branch (PSB) is currently organized into four (4) team sections. Applicant Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF special agents, industry operations investigators, and other ATF personnel. Contractor Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF contractors, student interns, volunteers, summer/winter hires, and other non-ATF personnel. Employee Team: responsible for conducting periodic reinvestigations on current ATF employees. Investigations Team: responsible for organizing assignments and reviewing background investigative leads sent to ATF Field Special Investigators. In addition, the Investigations Team provides guidance and assistance to Special Investigators in the field; they also serve as the authority for investigative coverage requirements.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them. Such tasks include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, reviewing and/or drafting policy and procedures (subject to final approval by ATF), generating status and statistical reports, evaluating and assessing priorities and procedures, and implementing necessary change, disseminating information to team members, team training, coordinating with team assistants, attending team/branch meetings when required, and working on special projects as directed by their Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief.</p>
<p>Contractors are responsible for organizing their team and maintaining communication with their team and PSB staff and management. They must have the ability to assess the needs of their team and effectively set goals and priorities to ensure compliance with mandated guidelines and ATF hiring goals. Contractors will correspond with the COTR and/or Branch Chief prior to initiating new policies/procedures or shifting team priorities. All policies are subject to final review by ATF. Contractors should be able to review current standards, make recommendations, and provide written direction. They are responsible for ensuring adequate training for new/transferred team members and providing any necessary guidance. Contractors must have the ability to effectively communicate with clear and concise thoughts both verbally and in writing. While contractors will be responsible for organizing assignments, they will exercise no supervisory authority over any other contractor. Contractors will not have the authority to discipline, withdraw clearances, issue awards, or represent themselves as supervisory. The contractor's position described in this Statement of Work is managerial in terms of cases, not in terms of personnel.</p>
<p>Contractor's duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability. Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested. Contractors will be paid at the rate of $61.00 per hour for each hour up to and including 40 hours or otherwise established rate as determined by ATF. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $91.50; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief. Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner. Each contactor must work a minimum number of 34 hours; working at a minimum four (4) days each week. Contractors shall not work more than ten hours per day without prior approval from their COTR and/or Branch Chief. Contractor's schedules are subject to final approval by ATF. Contractors are responsible for coordinating adequate office coverage for their respective team; to include holidays and high vacation/travel months. Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract.</p>
<p>In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked. Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor's invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services. This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations. Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract. Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.</p>
<p>Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support e-mail, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.</p>
<p>Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States. Conferences are usually limited to one (1) per year.</p>
<p>Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users. Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year. Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p>
<p>Each contractor shall undergo a personnel security investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and/or data. This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch (PSB), and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish. Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated background investigation and receive a Top Secret clearance. The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.</p>
<p>Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor. Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or information technology systems will not be authorized.</p>
<p>Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that does not contribute to ATF being portrayed in a negative light. To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired. Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.</p>
<p>Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected. Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.</p>
<p>Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to you by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain. Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession. Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.</p>
<p>Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information. Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act and, unless classified, is considered Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) information. SBU information must not be transmitted via unsecured e-mail or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties. Contractors must never furnish or divulge SBU information contained a background investigation record.</p>
<p>Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer.</p>
<p>ATF intends to issue contractors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through June 30, 2013. The solicitation will close January 13, 2010 at <br />4 p.m. EST. All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors. A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably. ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation due to attrition.</p>
<p>Contractors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA. A BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected contractors are in a position to furnish, and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods. There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected contractor, or the call will be transferred to another contractor. Calls/orders may be competed among all contractors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference) Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far - or the contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov. Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the terms and conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.</p>
<p>Capability of the Contractor.</p>
<p>ATF will consider BPAs to contractors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the contractor's assent to ATF's terms and conditions, including the hourly rate. All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration. Any contractor failing to comply with these mandatory requirements will be eliminated. Contractors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability. Contractors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience. Contractors with an overall score of at least 75 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those contractors receiving the highest scores if a position is available. At least 45 points must come from Offer or Demonstrated Experience / Qualifications and at least 30 points must come from Contractor Past Performance / Capabilities.</p>
<p>a. Experience/Qualifications (60 Points): Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. A minimum of three (3) years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended. ATF will evaluate each contractor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the Federal environment, as well as computer proficiency. ATF may assess the contractor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (45 points minimum).</p>
<p>b. Past Performance/Capabilities (40 Points): Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations. ATF may contact some of the contractor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the contractor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the contractor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the contractor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the contractor was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (30 points minimum).</p>
<p>Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF. ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.</p>
<p>c. Acceptability. ATF will determine the acceptability of each contractor offer on a "pass" or "fail" basis. A contractor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the contractor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any). If a contractor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable. Contractors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Price<br />4. Past Performance <br />Award will be made to the offer or proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery, and past performance in the above order of precedence. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This announcement serves as a Request for Qualifications (SF-330) for a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), A&E services contract.  In accordance with FAR 16.5, firm-fixed price task orders will be issued for work throughout the State of Wisconsin. Contracts will be awarded for the remainder of FY-10.  Four one-year option periods will be included in the contract award.  The fifth option period will be the number of months passed in FY-10 prior to award date. Work under any contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. 

The price of any single task order shall be at least $2,500 but shall not exceed $1,000,000. The awarded contracts shall have a guaranteed contract minimum amount of $5,000 during the life of the contract (there shall be no guaranteed minimum for option periods, if exercised) and will be limited to a maximum contract amount of $4,000,000 (total for all contracts) over a five year period. The applicable NAICS code is 541330 with a size standard of $4.5 million. 

Task orders may include performance of any part or all operations necessary to provide solutions to natural resource concerns by performing A&E services including site investigations, permit application information development, engineering planning, engineering surveys, legal surveys, engineering designs, and construction quality assurance for the installation of projects funded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), or other Natural Resources Conservation Service Programs and any of the soil and water conservation practices approved under these programs as listed in Section IV of the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) for the State of Wisconsin. Tasks will focus on conservation practices associated with animal waste management components and systems. Tasks may also include conservation practices associated with, but are not limited to, wetland restoration, stream restoration and erosion control systems.

This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act procedures. The government contemplates the award of three possible Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), A&E services contracts, utilizing firm-fixed price task orders. The Government reserves the right to exercise any option periods. Prior to award, firms shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). Visit www.ccr.gov to register. Prior to award, firms shall complete the On-line Representations and Certifications at www.orca.gov. Contracts may be negotiated and awarded up to one year after completion of the selection process. Work under each of the awarded contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Task orders will be negotiated as firm-fixed price procurements for the A&E services.

The A&E firm will be required to perform engineering planning, engineering surveys, legal surveys, engineering designs and construction services, as indicated below, for the installation of soil and water conservation practices in accordance with NRCS standards as listed in Section IV of the Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) and certify that all engineering planning documents, engineering surveys, engineering designs, and construction services meet NRCS standards, specifications, policy, handbooks, and documentation requirements. 

Engineering planning activities required may consist of, but are not limited to, any part of the preparation of engineering planning documents for scheduling the installation of selected alternatives with associated cost estimates and quantity estimates for the installation of soil and water conservation practices. Engineering planning activities may include, but are not limited to: collecting resource information, providing technical requirements, developing alternatives to protect resources and meet other objectives of the landowner, informing the landowner of potential operation and maintenance requirements, conducting site investigations and preliminary surveys as needed, informing the landowner of potential construction requirements, and needed permits, and/or preparing damage survey reports (DSR) for emergency recovery work.

Engineering surveys may consist of, but are not limited to, any part or all of the following activities: legal surveys for easement boundaries, topographic/planimetric surveys, horizontal and vertical control surveys, survey quality GPS surveys, design surveys, development of graphical representations of survey data collected, construction layout and certification surveys, and surveys for quantity computations.

Engineering design activities required may consist of, but are not limited to, any part or all of the following activities: preliminary field investigations, geologic and soils investigations, design of soil and water conservation practices, designing emergency recovery work, repair and replacement of existing systems, preparing construction specifications, preparing engineering and construction plans (drawings), preparing land rights work maps, preparing quantity and cost estimates, preparing bid schedules, quantity computations, preparing dam breach analysis, preparing water surface profiles, preparing hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, preparing design documentation folders and preparing supporting documentation for applicable federal, state and local permits. The firm will be required to interpret geotechnical reports and accurately apply the data to the design of the soil and water conservation practice measures where available. 

Construction services may consist of, but are not limited to, any part or all of the construction layout, construction inspection, construction quality assurance (inspection), quantity computations, construction checkout and certification of completed soil and water conservation practices including emergency recovery work. Construction services do not include actual construction of the soil and water conservation practices. The A&E services may involve direct consultation, inspection of construction for a specific project, including reviews of shop drawings, material selections, and quality control testing such as those associated with concrete placement and earthfill compaction.

Contracts may include review of services provided by other A&E firms.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>The first purpose of amendment #1 to synopsis HSBP1010R2885 posted on December 16, 2009, is to inform all offerors that as of January 4, 2010, the solicitation number has changed from HSBP1010R2885 to HSBP1010R0021.

The second purpose of this amendment is to answer the following question submitted to CBP on January 4, 2010:

Question:

The FBO notice indicates a need for a facility, vehicles and support services, however; it then indicates that CBP will provide all vehicles. Is it just a facility requirement with minimal logistical needs to run the facility or is there a need for both the facility and the vehicles?

Answer: 

The Government will provide some vehicles, while we expect the contractor to provide the vehicles for the Offensive Drive Techniques modified with safety equipment. The SOW, which will be a part of the solicitation, will provide further details.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

Recovery Act funds for NASAs Aeronautics ResearchProgram will accelerate key research, enhance the state of aeronautics for the nation,and provide a foundation for addressing the need for a Next Generation Air TransportationSystem (NextGen.) To increase the safety of aviation, better information on theperformance of aircraft jet engines is required. To produce such information, electroniccircuits that are able to sense the engines performance while it is operating andtransmit the collected data wirelessly must be placed inside the engine. This presents anextremely harsh environment for the operation of the electronic circuits, especially interms of operating temperatures which exceed 300 o C. In order to enable electroniccircuits that can operate in such harsh environments, and can also be manufactured intosmall, lightweight, and non-intrusive packages, new materials must be used and newfabrication processes developed.There are a range of components which are necessary to enable this high-temperatureengine performance monitoring and data transmitting circuit. This includeshigh-temperature packaging and interconnects as well as components within the circuititself. One major and fundamental circuit component is a capacitor.This order will develop and validate a process for fabricating a capacitor that can beintegrated into the high temperature circuit, using a material called silicon carbide.While silicon based semiconductors have enabled quite complex room-temperature circuitsto be miniaturized onto small chips, the extension of this technology to temperaturesabove 300 C is impractical. Silicon carbide (SiC) is the strongest candidatesemiconductor for implementing 400-600 C integrated electronics.

Recovery act funds for NASAs Fundamental AeroProgram (FAP) are being utilized to help design, develop and test aircraft-engineultra-high bypass (UHB) component technology hardware for the Environmentally ResponsibleAviation Project, Propulsion Technology Sub-Project, Propulsor Element, Isolated andInstalled GTF testing 9x15 Sub-Element.NASA Glenn Research Center has the capability to test scale models that simulate aircraftengine propulsion in the Centers wind tunnel facilities. Some of these scale models areconcepts of the next generation of todays aircraft engines, called turbofans. The windtunnel testing is performed to determine the performance and noise levels of new turbofanengine designs. A special test rig is used to power these model turbofans. The test rigis called the Ultra High Bypass Drive Rig, or UHB Drive Rig. The UHB Drive Rig providespower to the model turbofan during testing through a shaft that connects the modelturbofan to a special air motor in the back of the Drive Rig. Hot, high pressure air issent to the special air motor to spin it and the connecting drive shaft, and then intothe model turbofan. The air is supplied through pipes that come through a central supplybuilding at Glenn to the wind tunnel then to the Drive Rig. To make sure the Drive Rig ishealthy and running smoothly and safely, there are special temperature sensors, pressuresensors and vibration sensors connected to the rotating parts inside the Drive Rig. Howwell the model turbofan is performing is also measured using devices called forcebalances. There are two force balances in the Drive Rig used to determine how much thrustthe model is producing and how much power it is taking to make that thrust. One forcebalance is connected to the spinning rotor, or fan, inside the model and spins with thefan; the other balance is connected to the non-spinning parts of the model called thestators and nacelle. Together they measure how much total force is produced by the model.Since all moving parts eventually wear out, the Drive Rig mechanical parts have to beinspected and rebuilt after every 2,000 hours of operation, or about every four years onaverage. This means the Drive Rig must be taken apart, the parts looked at with specialequipment, the worn out parts replaced or rebuilt, and the Rig then put back together.Some of the parts also must be checked to make sure they operate like new, for instancethe force balances. The safety and health sensors inside the Drive Rig must also bereplaced at this time. Once all repairs are done, the Drive Rig is like new again. ThisDrive Rig has been rebuilt twice before over the last fourteen years. It requiresspecially trained people and special equipment to do all the tasks needed to make theDrive Rig operate as it was designed to by its manufacturer.This order's efforts will ensure the UHB Drive Rig is compliant with current applicableGRC wind tunnel facility testing standards (e.g. NASA-TM-106565). Refurbishing the UHBDrive Rig will restore the test rig to its fully operational condition, allowing it toreach the original performance capabilities as designed by the original manufacturer. Thedata measurements systems on board (the two force balances) will be recertified to insurequality data is obtained (per original manufacturer specifications provided to NASA).A fully capable test rig will allow wind tunnel testing of advanced scale model turbofanpropulsion designs, which will provide data for validation and enhancement of predictionand system design analysis tools.
