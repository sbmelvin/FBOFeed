Association, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1825, Arlington
VA 22209.  The anticipated date of award is August
23, 2005.

The purpose of this request is to support the development and publication of a series of articles in the journal, Psychiatric Services. These articles will focus on issues and topics
related to mental health transformation and other issues associated with the report of the President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, “Achieving the Promise:
Transforming Mental Health Care in America,” July, 2003.  The articles will appear in the journal in groups of 2 or 3 in a special section identified for articles associated with mental health transformation.  With the approval of CMHS/SAMHSA, the editors of Psychiatric Services will commission specific
articles and authors for the special section, and manage
their review and publication.  CMHS/SAMHSA will also review
and approve each article before publication, although articles not approved by CMHS/SAMHSA may nevertheless appear in other
parts or issues of the journal.  A minimum of 15 articles will
be published over an 18-month period, and may consist of commentaries, brief reports, regular or review articles, or
other similar contributions of 900 words or more.  Following
publication of all the articles, Psychiatric Services will collect and print all of the articles in a separate document
for dissemination by CMHS/SAMHSA.

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and supplies, and perform the work set forth below.

All reports, statistics, or tables produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government, which includes
the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
SAMHSA or CMHS may utilize, print, or disseminate such material
without further charge.

The workplan should identify subject areas for grouping articles, proposed topics, and authors suggested for developing articles on each topic.  At least 15 articles should be published over a period of 18 months.  Revise the workplan in response to PO comments.

Develop and publish the approved articles.  In doing so, the Contractor shall manage all aspects of article production, including recruitment of authors, editorial review, and
other related activities.  One or more persons designated by CMHS/SAMHSA will participate in the editorial/review process
and completed articles will not be accepted for publication
without both contractor and SAMHSA approval.  Articles rejected for publication in the series on Transformation may nevertheless be published by the Contractor in some other time or place
outside of the series.

Following completion of the series, collect all of the articles in a single document for printing and distribution.  Provide 5,000 copies of this document to CMHS/SAMHSA.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify
their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days
after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by
the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

NPC has performed detailed process evaluations for 17 adult drug treatment courts in multiple sites including Oregon, California, Maryland and Guam.  Fifteen of these drug courts have associated outcome evaluation and 13 have associated cost-benefit analyses.  The research provided by NPC will describe the policies and procedures in the 17 adult drug courts evaluated by NPC and examine the policies and procedures in relation to drug court typologies developed by other researches, including the ten key components of drug courts.   This type of multi site study has not been prepared by other researchers and would prove extremely beneficial for the understanding of drug court variations.  Critical to NIJ’s effort is the fact that each study that NPC conducted was done so using the methodology in all courts which in turn allows NIJ to examine characteristics of different models and their success rates. The fact that these studies and all the data associated with them are housed in NPC research provides the basis justifying the use of the contractor.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

<DESC>DOE/NNSA/Service Center intends to purchase three 2006 Freightliner, Columbia CL 120 tractors, with custom sleepers.  This acquisition is supported by a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for Specific Make and Model.  The Freightliner tractor is compatible with and will be incorporated into the existing fleet of 51 Peterbilt tractors, models 1998-2000, to ensure compatibility, interoperability and consistency for training and maintenance. The Freightliner tractors consist of the following major compatibility components:  Detroit Diesel engine (DDC60-12.7L, 445 HP); Allison 4000 HS automatic transmission; 224 inch wheel base closely matching current tractor fleet; Neeway air suspension model AD 246; cab configuration closely matching current tractor fleet; parts matching current fleet, such as Bendix TU-Flo 550, 13.2 CFM air compressor; custom alternator, Leese Neville 200 AMP alternator, model 4550JB; custom batteries; Meritor front and rear axles, 12,000/14,000 capacity; and Holland fifth wheel with special location. Freightliner specifications provide the closest match to the existing tractor fleet and are compatible with currently operational systems and requirements. Only Freightliner currently offers a vehicle similar enough to the existing fleet to satisfy the agencyâ€™s program office requirement.  Vendors who can furnish the required item are invited to submit a written substantive statement clearly stating the ability to fill this requirement.  Oral communications are not acceptable.  Substantiveness would be indicated by a statement of exactly what type of item is offered, delivery schedule, FOB point, and any other information which shows a bonafide ability to meet this specific requirement. Delivery is requested on or about August 31, 2005 to FOB point, Barling AR. This purchase will be 100% set aside for small business re-sellers of Freightliner, Columbia CL 120 tractors, with custom sleepers.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received from this notice, since this notice cannot be considered a formal solicitation document.  This is a notice of intent to award for specific make and model and is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may submit an offer and it will be considered by the agency.  All interested firms must respond to DE-AF52-05-NA26581 by 5:00 PM, MDT, Monday, August 15, 2005 to ATTN: Maggie Howe; DOE/NNSA; OBS/Acquisition Dept/TSD; P.O. Box 5400; Albuquerque NM; 87185-5400 or to mhowe@doeal.gov.

Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2005.3, which was publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on August 1, 2005.   The 2005.3 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on September 14, 2005 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, October 14, 2005.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Three DoD components will participate in the 2005.3 solicitation – the Department of Navy, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms.

NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  Operational Effectiveness - Describe your ability to currently meet the purchase requirements.  Ensure that your stated response addresses overall product compatibility, as well as any additional parameters not specifically cited in the purchase requirement. Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the resulting product.  Delivery Schedule - Provide your delivery schedule schedule to meet this requirement.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representatio! n and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on c! reating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed in! formation regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination.. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:   Any award resulting from the solicitation wi! ll include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for services regarding The Family Study of Melanoma in Italy, Tissue Study subgroup (02-C-N038), with Dr. Donato Calista, Department of Dermatology, Bufalini Hospital, Via Ex Tiro a Segno, 6, 47023 Cesena (FC), Italy.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Family Study of Melanoma in Italy, Tissue Study subgroup is conducted at the Maurizio Bufalini Hospital in Cesena, Italy. NCI proposes to conduct a series of expression and genetic studies on patients examined by Donato Calista, MD.  Individuals with fair pigmentation, low tanning ability, germline mutations in susceptibility genes, and many melanocytic nevi or dysplastic nevi (DN), are at increased risk of developing melanoma. However, these risk factors may lead to melanoma formation through multiple pathways. The investigation into molecular distinctions between individuals who develop melanomas through different avenues may allow the tailoring of public-health messages to the specific population at risk.  NCI has designed a study to investigate whether there are signs of a direct transition from common melanocytic nevi to dysplastic nevi to melanoma. The study focuses on the comparison of gene expression from different tissue types (normal skin, nevi, and melanoma) from the same individuals.  In addition, the study compares gene expression with protein profile and genotype of the same subjects. Epidemiological and clinical data will be collected as well as photographs of the skin lesions of interest.  NCI has already successfully conducted a case-control study and a family study at the Maurizio Bufalini Hospital, Cesena, Italy. The Dermatology Unit of the “M. Bufalini” Hospital, Cesena, Italy is a reference point for the regions of Southern Emilia-Romagna and Northern Marche, with a population of around 1,000,000. The patients referred to the Bufalini Hospital include more than 85% of the melanoma patients of the area. Dr. Donato Calista at the Bufalini Hospital personally examines the melanoma cases of the Bufalini Hospital. He has collaborated in the past with NCI and has been trained in the recognition of dysplastic nevi and melanoma. Dr. Calista led the field activities of two previous melanoma studies conducted with NCI, and can ensure continuity in the research.  In addition, Dr. Calista has acquired expertise in the practical aspects involved in the management of data, photographs, clinical forms, informed consents, and biospecimens, according to NCI standards and needs, and has access to medical records from the Bufalini Hospital, which is crucial for our comparisons.  Period of Performance:  September 1, 2005 – August 31, 2006 with one optional year.  Dr. Donato Claista at the Bufalini Hospital in Italy is the only source known that can provide the services and expertise needed to full fill the requirements of the NCI.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT on August 15, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Please reference NCI-50119-NG on all correspondence.

Only Hitachi has the capability for servicing such a complex instrument, with an established organization for providing such service.  This organization includes trained service engineers, spare parts inventory, maintenance manuals, access to other working instruments, and years of experience with the instrument.  Preventive maintenance procedures will be performed twice per year.  No other company provides, or could provide, such a service. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 15, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>US-VISIT
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT
Electronic Machine Readable Travel Document (e-MRTD) Readers

1.0	INTRODUCTION	
The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program works with other agencies (stakeholders) such as the Customs & Border Patrol (CBP), Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of State, and others to enhance traveler security.  This is accomplished by leveraging existing systems to retrieve an integrated view of information from a number of different sources.  The information is used to establish the legal basis for entry into and exit from the U.S.  The US-VISIT Program is focused on travelers that have non-immigrant Visas to enter the United States, referred to as in-scope travelers.  The Program deploys identification and verification capabilities at air, sea and land Ports of Entry (POEs) that improve the integrity of the immigration system while also reducing the amount of time needed to process in-scope travelers.

US-VISIT functionality has been rolled-out in releases, called Increments, which first established improvements at sensitive air and sea POEs and then extended many of the same capabilities to the busiest land POEs.  The purpose of Increment 2A is to implement the requirements of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act (EBSVERA) of 2002, Public Law 107-173, 8 U.S.C 1701 et seq., alternatively called the Border Security Act (BSA) of May 14, 2002, as amended.  Section 303(b) of the BSA created a series of legislative mandates that the U.S. Government is expected to accomplish by specific dates:
U.S. Issued Documents: All visas and other travel and entry documents issued to aliens must be machine-readable and tamper resistant, and include biometric identifiers, by October 26, 2004 §303(b) (1). 
Equipment to Authenticate U.S.-Issued Documents: DHS must install at all United States ports-of-entry (POEs) equipment and software to allow for the biometric comparison and authentication of all United States visas and other travel and entry documents issued to aliens, extension granted to October 26, 2005. §303(b)(2)(A).
Equipment to Authenticate Visa Waiver Program (VWP) Passports: DHS must install at all United States ports-of-entry (POEs) equipment and software to allow for the biometric comparison and authentication of all passports issued by Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries, extension granted to October 26, 2005. §303(b)(2)(A).
VWP Certification: All VWP countries must certify that it has a program in place to issue to its nationals machine-readable passports incorporating biometrics pursuant to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, extension granted to October 26, 2005. §303(c)(1).   
US VISIT Increment 2A is primarily responsible for the establishment of the capabilities stipulated in Section 303 (b)(2)(A) of the BSA. This responsibility entails the acquisition of “reading” equipment and software that can be interfaced with the current POE automated systems and equipment, and provides for processing of travelers to the U.S as well as U.S. citizens.  

2.0	PURPOSE
The Government, by means of this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS), seeks to identify potential suppliers of e-MRTD readers and solicit feedback on the requirements and application programming interface (API) provided in this RFI. In this context an e-MRTD reader must have the capability to read biometrically enabled e-Passports, US issued traveled documents, and legacy documents as defined in the requirements in Attachment 2. The e-MRTD reader is a key component of the integrated border inspection processes that provides the capability to read and authenticate ICAO compliant biometrically enabled e-Passports and other Machine Readable Travel Documents. The vision of the US-VISIT Program is to apply and deploy this technology in a manner that will provide enhancements to the current border inspections processes.
The e-MRTD readers for US-VISIT will be deployed to a demanding environment critical to the security of the United States. Reading and authenticating electronically enabled travel documents requires the introduction of new hardware and software into the inspection process, presenting significant risk.   This RFI defines capabilities that allow the application of standards to meet the US-VISIT design parameters.  
An example of the challenge faced is the time it takes to read necessary information from the travel document. Currently it takes 0.5 seconds to read the MRZ of a travel document.  The current read time of an e-Passport without Basic Access Control (BAC) averages about 2.5 seconds. E-Passports with BAC will add additional time on to the inspection process.  US-VISIT is interested in technology that will allow the reading of e-Passports with BAC as accurately and as quickly as possible
Key factors in evaluating e-Passport reader technology include: 
•	The fastest possible accurate read times for all travel documents, including ones with BAC. 
•	The human factors of the reader, due to the high flow-rate environment of larger Ports of Entries (POEs)
•	Prevention of eavesdropping and skimming. Though BAC will be used to prevent eavesdropping, it is highly desired that the reader provided is highly resistant to electronic skimming and eavesdropping
•	Optional or upgrade capability of document authentication utilizing multiple light sources to include ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (IR). The device may also provide for advanced matching against travel document templates.

The support of industry in meeting the technological challenges of e-MRTDs described in the requirements in this RFI is key to the successful processing of these new travel documents as part of US-VISIT.

Relevant information gathered during the RFI/SS process will be summarized and shared with US-VISIT stakeholders.  

3.0	SUBMITTAL
Through on-going programs US-VISIT has developed a series of mandatory and desirable requirements for e-MRTD readers.  Additionally, an application programming interface (API) has been developed to support efficient integration into the US-VISIT system. These technical requirements are detailed in the Attachments and should be used to prepare your response to this RFI/SS. These requirements are subject to revision prior to the subsequent release of a formal Request for Proposal. It is requested that potential vendors supply feedback (both positive and negative) and questions on both the requirements and the API. Vendors should use the following outline to guide their response.  (Please use the same numbering order and headings within your response to this RFI.)


1.	Brief overview of your company and organization.
2.	Understanding of the US-VISIT e-MRTD RFI – the vendor should state their understanding of what US-VISIT is asking for in this RFI.
3.	. Requirements Questions and Comments – the vendor should submit any questions or concerns regarding the requirements in Attachment 2. This should include any questions regarding the clarity of the requirements, the categorization of mandatory versus desirable, ability of the vendor to meet the requirements, and any other questions the vendor may have.
4.	Application Programming Interface (API) Questions and Comments – – the vendor should submit any questions or concerns regarding the API in Attachment 1.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors/ International Broadcasting Bureau 
(BBG/IBB) intends to negotiate and award a non-competitive contract to The Logan Group, Inc., 506 West 19th Street, Suite 327, Houston, TX  77008.  This is a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), other than full and open competition, only one (1) responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency’s requirements.  The Broadcasting Board of Governors/International Broadcasting Bureau’s (BBG/IBB) Office of Engineering Broadcast Technologies Division (B/EI) requires a Contractor to design, develop and deliver a Unified Messaging System (UMS) and a HTTP Testing Toolset, to include documentation and training.  The Contractor is experienced in providing UMS and HTTP Testing Toolsets.  The Contractor is familiar with anti-blocking and the development of UMS and HTTP Testing Toolsets and the unique needs of Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting to China and Iran.  Because of its experience, the Contractor is needed in order to ensure that users who have been blocked from receiving IBB news via Instant Messaging in China can gain immediate access with little or no change in hardware/software, and learn about accurate, objective and comprehensive VOA broadcasts that clearly present the policies of the United States.  The UMS computer system would be used to assist IBB in disseminating news to China and Iran Internet users and will enable BBG to send up-to-the-minute news to Internet users in censored countries.  The HTTP Testing Toolset is needed to detect and identify the Internet filtering points in Iran.  The UMS and HTTP Testing Toolset will assist the Agency’s Anti-censorship team to defeat Internet censorship set in place by China and Iran.  A market survey was conducted and the results found The Logan Group as the source because of its ability to develop the UMS and HTTP Testing Toolset.  Also, The Logan Group is capable at developing a highly reliable system that will function in all network environments, including, but not limited to hostile and censored networks.  Those who are interested must have at least two years of strong prior experience in delivering large scale anti-censorship technologies and in-depth knowledge of Internet censorship technologies employed by the Chinese and the Iranian government.  Interested sources also must have at least two years proven track records of active involvement in Internet censorship technologies researches, including but not limited to, instant messaging and network topological analysis for censored countries.  Service provider must already have all the technologies available and be able to successfully provide the requested services within a six-month period.   Delivery: FOB Destination.  Term of Contract: Six (6) months after contract award.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive price proposals.  Those who are interested must submit adequate documentation of their capability to respond to this requirement.  The documentation shall be sufficient in detail to allow an evaluation without the need for added information.  Any questions regarding this Notice shall be in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer, Marlene Brooks via facsimile at (202) 260-0855 or E-mail at mbrooks@ibb.gov.  The deadline for receipt of questions is August 18, 2005.  Interested sources shall ensure that the Government receives their statements of interest by 2:00PM Daylight Savings Time (DST), September 6, 2005.  This notice is not a RFP, IFB or RFQ.  Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The MDA intends to award 14-month sole source cost-plus fixed-fee follow-on contract modifications to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) (under Contract HQ0006-04-C-0002) and to SPARTA, Inc. (under Contract HQ0006-02-C-0004) for continuation of critical SETA support of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  These extensions will be for the minimum amount of time necessary to avoid disruption of services essential to the continued development and deployment of the BMDS while MDA continues with its efforts to reengineer the MDA organization and revise its program plan.

These actions will assure uninterrupted, essential continuity of unique highly technical engineering, analytical and support services required to support MDA’s BMDS mission, and will assure MDA will maintain the critically needed skill-set capability to keep MDA executing on a sensitive and timely schedule.  CSC and SPARTA are the only companies that have the current requisite expertise to maintain the level of support required.  Current contractor personnel are key to preserving the Agency’s real-time integrated strategic capability while ensuring reliability, consistency, management, and response times needed to support the Agency’s mission.  No other sources would have the necessary level of expertise relating to both MDA SE research and program activities, or could achieve the required level without significant delays and cost that would impact MDA’s ability to support the BMDS without negatively impacting MDA's ability to comply with critical mission requirements.

MDA is currently conducting an Agency-wide reengineering effort to find smarter, more efficient ways to do business and transform the Agency from one comprised of individual programs to one comprised of components that can be ultimately integrated into a layered ballistic missile defense system.  As a result of these reengineering efforts, the MDA Deputy for SE is evaluating these impacts to the MDA Systems Engineering processes.  Once these impacts are determined, a new SE requirement will be generated and competitively procured in the late Summer/early Fall of 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>R -- IBIS Source Code Escrow and Verification
<SOLNBR>BATFIBIS071805
<RESPDATE>080905
<ARCHDATE>08242005
<CONTACT>Brian Wilkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 927-7715, Fax (202) 927-8688, Email Brian.Wilkins@atf.gov
<DESC>Modification #2 is hereby issued to add the following questions and answers:

1)  Section 4 of the solicitation, entitled "Source Code Escrow Services" states that "The Contractor will accept at least four (4) deposits of software updates and patches per year with no additional charge."  To respond to this requirement, can a bid have tiered pricing (e.g., '$X annual charge, which includes up to four updates, but there may be an additional charge of $Y per additional update for the 5 or more subsequent updates in any given year)?  
 Yes. Additional charges for additional updates beyond the four required will be accepted.
 
Time & Materials Portion for Verification Services:
 
1)  Should the time & materials bid include a total approximated cost estimate, or only an hourly charge for the services rendered?
Bid should include a total approximated cost estimate with in-depth basis of estimate describing hours and work packages.
 
2)  How are material costs handled?  For example, if particular computer equipment or software products must be purchased to conduct the verification procedures, do those costs have to be figured into the current bid, or can they be included in subsequent purchase orders?  To estimate these costs in advance will require some knowledge of what hardware or software the Vendor will provide, but that information is not available in the solicitation.
The contractor (for source code verification) is required to provide the hardware and software necessary to build the executables. The hardware necessary to test and verify and test the IBIS system will be provided by FTI and/or ATF. It is not expected that the contractor will need to purchase any equipment.
 
3)  For the "Determine/Confirm and Recreate Build Environment" step of the verification services the solicitation states that the contractor will be able to contact the IBIS vendor to gather necessary information.  Do you know the scope of the information the vendor can or will provided?  For example, will the vendor make any of the following items available:  make-file instructions, user documentation for building a new, non-configured system from scratch, installation procedures, information on libraries, tools, or compiler types/versions used to build the files?  Without the vendor providing this information, the verification will take longer than it would if the information was made available.   Also, escrow deposit materials sometimes do not include "off-the-shelf" items; will any specifically required hardware or software materials be provided by the vendor for this account (for example, Microsoft Visual C++, Oracle 7, etc., if those are currently required to re-create the build environment), or should the cost of those products be built into my bid?
It is expected that the hardware and software materials required to recreate the environment are requirements for the contractor's line of business and therefore are to be provided by the contractor. FTI is required to provide the necessary information to the source code verification vendor.
 
4)  For the "Test" step of the verification services, other than loading the executables onto the IBIS system and making sure that they run, what is the role of the contractor in testing the functionality of the system according to the ATF's test plan?  For example, if the DAS/R has problems remotely communicating with a regional ATF IBIS server, is that a problem the contractor is expected to correct, or do security or other agency concerns require that ATF's internal IT or networking personnel address the remote-connection problem?
The source code verification contractor is expected to load the executables onto the IBIS system and make sure that they run. The contractor will verify all processes are running. The contractor will not be expected to perform an IBIS functionality test

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS 
13 JULY 2005
1.0 SCOPE
The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of larger absorber in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 1,680 EACH 72” absorber and 36 EACH 24" absorbers is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies.
2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
IEEE STANDARD 1128 – “Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz”.

NRL Report 8093 – “Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers”.  
3.0 REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Testing
Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on table below.)










The break points are listed in the table below:

Frequency (MHz)	Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB)
80	-20
120	-30
200	-40
300	-40
500	-45

3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints
Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance. 

The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov – 2 Dec 2005.

The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery.

3.3 Fire Retardant
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  

3.4 Physical Characteristics
Overall Height:	72 inches +/-0.5 inch
Overall Absorber Footprint:	24 inches square +/-0.125 inch
Pyramids per Piece:	1
Pyramid Shape:	Conventional microwave absorber
Base Height:	12 inches +/-0.25 inch
Pyramid Height:	60 inches +/-0.25 inch
Fire Retardant Loading:	1.1 lbs/ft(to the third power) +/-5%
Paint:	Light Blue
Installation Backing:	None
Carbon Compound Loading:	TBD* +/-5%
* Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/ftto the third power, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.


3.4 Past Performance Requirements
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements:
•	RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2)
•	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
•	Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.5 Program Management
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

Reply (6): (7) If your firm, either individually or as a formal joint venture or under a formal teaming arrangement, has held a Federal contract please provide the following information (if there are more than three such contracts, please provide the information for the three most recently completed acquisitions): (a) Contracting Agency Address & contracting officer's name and telephone number. (b) Contract Number, date and amount of award, date of completion (c) Description of Items/Services provided under the contract. (d) State whether or not there were any performance issues under the contract which resulted in the issuance of a Cure Notice or Show  Cause Notice by the contracting officer. Reply (7): (8) Please provide references from those customers that have an ongoing relationship with your firm, the construction services purchased by these customers, and the estimated value and magnitude of these contractual arrangements  (9) Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.? If so, please provide the specifics. Reply (9): (10) Has your firm, or any firm that you would potentially joint venture or team with for a large acquisition of construction services or for any acquisition ever bid on a Federal acquisition and been determined non-responsible by the contracting officer and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) failed to issue a Certificate of Competency (COC) to your firm or teaming partners when the matter was referred to SBA for review and consideration? Reply (10): Please e-mail your responses and any relevant information regarding specific performance or other qualifications regarding the construction services requested, no later than August 12, 2005 to Ms. Diane Campbell, at: vacocampbd1@mail.va.gov or Michael Hannum at Michael.hannum@mail.va.gov.  Do not send hard copy advertising or promotional materials. Please ensure that all responses are comprehensive and provide a name and point-of-contact for your firm for follow-up by this office or the procuring contracting officer. If you have responded to any previous e-mail messages or had other communications with our office regarding preliminary market research for this construction project, please be advised that it will be necessary for you to respond to this e-mail and the questions contained therein. Although responses are not required, the information will be helpful in assisting this office, as SDVOSB advocates, in trying to influence the acquisition strategy for the construction project in Massachusetts by ensuring maximum practicable opportunities for SDVOSBs.

<DESC>INDIVIDUAL ALERT SYSTEM THEATER
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available individual alert system.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

United States Air Force requires an individual alert system for personnel deployed in Air Expeditionary Forces.  For example, such an alert system could conceivably be employed in the following scenarios:  if a missile was detected and about to strike an area, an alert message could be sent out to individuals within that area in near real-time, including those who may not be within audible range of a base alert buzzer.  The system could also be used to send out time critical instructions like FPCON changes.  The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	Support an individual alert system for personnel, wherever they may be located in the world.  
2.	System could incorporate one or several methods of delivery
2.1.	System could incorporate algorithms to incorporate sending warning alerts/messages in relation to individual’s proximity to a GPS location or grid location.  Alerts should be capable of only notifying individuals that are within a certain radius of the GPS location or within the applicable grid location.
2.2.	System could display a warning alerts/message for a certain units or series of multiple units.
3.	Control capabilities should be easy to implement so that messages can be transmitted real-time without delay.
4.	Encryption capabilities from sender to receiver would also be an option.
5.	Warning alerts would incorporate various audible tones
6.	Message text could display short messages
7.	Units could be rechargeable and/or have extended battery life
8.	Units should be water resistant
9.	Units should be shock resistant

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 1 Sep 05 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>RADIO FREQUENCY AWARENESS THEATER
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available radio frequency detection and geolocation capabilities.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  IAW Joint Publication 3-14 (JP-3-14) “space capabilities may be vulnerable to attack…ground to satellite links are susceptible to jamming…fixed command and control facilities are subject to attack, which could degrade the utility of a satellite’s service over time.”  In addition, JP 3-14 states, “military, civil, and commercial sectors of the United States are increasingly dependent on space capabilities, and this dependence can be viewed by adversaries as a potential vulnerability [, and] commanders must anticipate hostile actions that attempt to deny friendly forces access to or use of space capabilities.”  Air Force Doctrine Document 2-2.1 (AFDD 2-2.1), Counterspace Operations states “improving the commander’s situational awareness and view of the battlespace (find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess space capabilities) and instituting appropriate protective and defensive measures to ensure friendly forces can continuously conduct space operations across the entire spectrum of conflict” are imperative initiatives.  AFDD 2-2.1 continues that “adversaries can conduct attacks against our space capabilities using various methods…[for example] radio frequency jamming equipment capable of interfering with space system links.”  In addition, AFDD 2-2.1 says “counterspace operations can provide a deterrent against attacks on US space assets; robust counterspace capabilities send the message that potential adversaries cannot act upon space assets with impunity; [and Space Situational Awareness] SSA capabilities can convince an adversary it is impossible to hide use of space systems or attacks against friendly space systems.”  General Lance Lord, Commander, Air Force Space Command recently stated, “that’s why I’m slowly shifting our gears from the force-enabling business to one where we actually think about defending our assets: doing the defensive kinds of things and the situational awareness things we need to do in space to make that shift.”

Therefore, the United States Air Force requires capability to detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) interference of communications capabilities deployed in Air Expeditionary Forces, particularly in Expeditionary Operations Centers.  The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	Support an RF interference detection and geolocation of interference capability.  
2.	Capability should be able to handle interference to satellite and ground based systems across the RF spectrum.
3.	Performs highly complex computations rapidly allowing it to pinpoint the source and cause of interference
4.	System should not be man intensive.  
5.	System should be highly automated, with user friendly interface, so little training is required
6.	Software should run on standard PCs, and is capable of simultaneous sampling and parallel processing
7.	Should be modular, so it can be tailored to meet specific requirements, and the software should be easily upgraded
8.	System should be easily deployable
9.	System should not be power intensive. 
10.	Needs remote login capability so interference detection and geolocation process can be controlled from anywhere in the world.
11.	Allow satellite operators to identify and resolve interference fast to maintain continuous quality of service
12.	 Data inputs should be able to incorporated into the larger Single Integrated Space Picture construct to increase commander’s SSA

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 1 Sep 05 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<SUBJECT>R -- Help Desk A-76 Streamlined Competition
<DESC>This is a formal public announcement, in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003), that the Department of Education (ED), Office of the Undersecretary, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Information Officer, will conduct an A-76 Streamlined Competition for the Education Data Exchange Network (EDEN) help desk support function located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The service provider (SP) shall assist ED in providing customer support to the EDEN data suppliers, including State Education Agencies, survey respondents, schools, and others.  It is expected that the comprehensive support services shall include a Technical Help Desk and Web Page Management.  The Technical Help Desk shall provide tier one (1), two (2), and three (3) level of technical support to ED partners, State and Local education agencies and third parties, as designated.  The goal of the Technical Help Desk support is to provide quality support through a full range of interaction channels, including a 1-800 number and e-mail, while meeting and exceeding established levels of service.  The SP shall provide customers with a single point of contact for service requests, resolution of IT-related issues, and general user administration.  The SP shall also develop and implement a Service Desk Management Methodology that is consistent with applicable current industry standards.  The SP shall provide comprehensive webpage management services to support the management of the Performance Based Data Management Initiative (PBDMI) webpage.

The purpose of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing these services for the Department.  The work is currently performed by 30 FTE from EDS Corporation and Dynamic Systems Technology.  An agency may develop an estimated contract price for performing the activity with a private sector source using documented market research or soliciting cost proposals in accordance with the FAR.  ED will use documented market research for this Streamlined Competition.  In accordance with A-76, ED will complete a Streamlined Competition Form to compare the estimated cost of agency performance with the estimated cost of private sector or public reimbursable performance.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Prospective offerors are advised that a solicitation will not be issued if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel. No solicitation exists at this time. Any solicitation resulting from this Streamlined Competition will be made available on www.fedbizopps.gov if and when it is released.  The projected end date of the streamlined competition is on or before October 31, 2005.

The ED Competitive Sourcing Official is Jack Martin; the Contracting Officer is Gary Weaver; the Agency Tender Official is Alex Koudry.

After generating inputs from a senior study group and internal technical experts, we are now seeking new concepts from industry.  AGENDA: DARPA, in partnership with the NGA, will host an Industry Workshop on Wednesday, 7 September 2005.  The focus of the Industry Workshop is to promote discussion of the DARPA NGA partnership.  The session will address NGA Focus Areas representing “hard problems” which will be jointly pursued under the partnership and a request for new concepts and ideas, in the form of white papers, responding to the challenges presented.  Interested parties to this notice are cautioned that nothing herein obligates DARPA, NGA or the Government to issue a future solicitation on this topic.  LOCATION: The DARPA NGA Partnership Workshop will be held at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, 4301 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, Virginia.  ATTENDEE INFORMATION: Registration is required by 26 August 2005.  Attendance will be limited to the first 200 registrants.  Each organization may send up to two representatives.  Additional organization attendees will be considered by DARPA at DARPA's sole discretion, if space allows additional organization representation, and if DARPA determines that such additional representation is in the best interest of DARPA.  However, DARPA reserves the right to limit organization participation to two individuals each, even if less than 200 total participants register for this Industry Workshop.  DARPA will not provide cost reimbursement for attendance.  The Industry Workshop will be unclassified and open to all U.S. citizens.  Attendance is not required to propose to any solicitation on this topic.  This workshop will begin at 8:00 a.m. EST and will end at 12:00 p.m. (noon) EST.

STATEMENT OF WORK	
FARRIER SERVICES FOR THE NCO STATION


The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Naco Station currently has twenty (20) horses assigned to it.  The number of horses may increase or decrease according to the mission requirements.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit¡¦s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. 

The station does not currently have a designated or contracted farrier to provide shoeing for the horses.  Employing a contractor would eliminate the need for the unit supervisor to seek out a farrier every five to eight weeks to shoe the station¡¦s horses.  A contract farrier would be held accountable for a guaranteed work product whereas a non-contract farrier limits his work to a very limited guaranty and would most likely charge a mileage fee to refit a shoe.  A disadvantage noted in soliciting a different farrier every shoeing cycle is that the farrier does not have the opportunity to ¡§learn¡¨ each horse and become familiar with its shoeing needs.  This lends itself to many an animal becoming lame, thus being placed out of service until it heals.  Some injuries due to lameness can permanently disable an animal, costing the agency in veterinary services and ultimately having to replace the animal.

The advantages to having a contract farrier is that he/she would become familiar with each of the animals and have an understanding of each of their shoeing needs.  A contract farrier would be required to comply with standards established by the agency or risk losing the contract award.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide services at a specified site. 

The following are minimum requirements for farrier services:

Farrier:

„h	Shoe horses every four to eight weeks by certified farrier. (Farrier should possess a certificate from a recognized Farrier Training Facility)

„h	If a shoe is lost ¡V replacement will be in a timely manner (within 24 hours)

„h	The farrier shall perform his/her work, 7-days per week, between the hours of 7:00am ¡V 5:00pm.

„h	Shall correct any discrepancies noted, as directed by the COTR or HPU SBPA, within a three day period after receipt of services at no additional cost to the Government.

„h	Shall maintain an approved Hoof Management and Maintenance Schedule (Final approval on any maintenance schedule shall be approved by the unit supervisor.)
„h	Shall have a minimum of three years experience at a journeyman level and be in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations.

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence within a three-day period after Farrier service. The COTR, Contracting Officer and HPU SBPA will determine negligence.

(2)	Shoeing locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

(End of provision) 
 


NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-8514), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330 THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-RT-05-10563 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541330 and the business size standard is $4.0 million. This is a total Small Business Set-aside.  A firm fixed price contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the revision  and update of the current RTP Division 1 Project Environmental Specification.  STATEMENT OF WORK: Background:  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the Research Triangle Park (RTP) Campus Project to minimize its impact on the environment as it considers environmental value in each design, construction, and operation decision.  In 1995, the designer of the first phase of the RTP Campus Project, the Research and Administration Facility, developed unique Division 1 construction contract specifications to address many of these environmental values.   These specifications are available at: http://www.epa.gov/rtp/new-bldg/environmental/specs.htm.  The designer invested considerable efforts to insure that these specifications represented the state of the art in environmental protection and green building materials and technology, while at the same time being readily available in the marketplace at competitive prices. EPA in RTP has continued to utilize the environmental specifications developed for the RTP Campus Project for subsequent developments on the campus, including the National Computer Center and the First Environments Early Learning Center projects, by incorporating the specifications into the design-build contracts for these developments.  EPA in RTP has also incorporated many of these specifications into its Campus facility Operations and Maintenance contract, to insure that the innovative practices utilized during campus design and construction are continued during building and site alterations and renovations during the operational life of the facility.   Green building materials, technology, and practices have evolved significantly since 1995, rendering our once cutting edge environmental specifications obsolete.  Despite the two significant design-build projects noted above being LEED-rated projects, the EPA has not updated the environmental specifications to keep up with the marketplace. Presently, the Agency has established a goal that all major newly constructed buildings achieve at least LEED? Silver certification.  Further, EPA requires other sustainable features for its majornew building acquisitions, including ENERGY STAR?  building certification; 30 percent better energy performance than ASHRAE 1990.9  requirements; specific water conservation measures; resource conservation, recycling, and use of sustainable building materials; and measures to protect indoor air quality. EPA also uses its Green Buildings Vision and Policy Statement, http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/projects/policy.htm as a guide for a holistic, systems approach to sustainable building design, construction, renovation, operation, and maintenance.  Work Requirement: EPA seeks a best-value proposal from a qualified team of building professionals (architects, engineers, and/or other building practitioners) to revise and update the current RTP Division 1 Project Environmental Specifications, http://www.epa.gov/rtp/new-bldg/environmental/specs.htm, to reflect the state of the art in green building design, construction, and operation, consistent with achieving Energy Star building performance and the LEED Existing Building Silver performance level.  The revised project environmental specifications will be used by OARM-RTP to govern all design, construction, and operations at EPA-RTP facilities.  1) All new specifications shall be Division 1 sections in latest CSI format and shall address all existing environmental specification sections.   Additional Division 1 specification sections may be proposed to address environmental issues not included in the above list as identified by the Proposer.  Each specification section shall be written in a guide specification format (project non-specific) with references to applicable technical provision specification sections 2 thru 17 (by number and title) to allow seamless integration into future development projects.   All references to technical provisions in the existing Division 1 project environmental specifications shall be reviewed, revised, updated, or expanded as necessary.  2) The contents of each specification section will be developed based on thorough review and integration of applicable building Codes, accepted green building practices, available green building products and technologies, published green building design tools and guide specifications , and green building rating systems.  The specifications shall reflect an integrated design approach to maximize building performance and minimize pollution in the areas of site, water, energy and atmosphere, indoor environmental quality, and materials.  The specifications shall be consistent with EPA?s published green building policies and guidelines available at http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/projects/index.htm.   Special emphasis shall be given to energy efficiency through mechanical and electrical system performance that is only minimally addressed in the existing RTP Campus project environmental specifications.  3) Each specification shall be accompanied by a concise guidance document explaining the rationale and analysis upon which the specification was developed.  This guidance document will also provide the basis for subsequent updating of the specifications over time.  At a minimum, the specification guidance sections shall address:  life cycle issues, potential problems and solutions, availability of materials, cost issues, and other special considerations.  The work effort shall include: a.) a two (2) day kickoff meeting with key EPA personnel involved with the development, design, construction, and operation of the RTP facility to determine the issues of greatest concern to EPA-RTP and to insure that the specifications reflect the unique needs of EPA-RTP.   This meeting shall take place on the RTP Campus.  b.) two (2) on-site presentations of the draft specifications and guidance documents, at 50% project completion, and at final completion.  After each presentation, EPA will provide written review comments within two (2) weeks, which shall be incorporated into the revised work product.  c.)  delivery of complete specifications and guidance documents in Word format on CD or DVD.  EPA-RTP intends to publish the revised project environmental specifications on its public internet web page at http://www.epa.gov/rtp/new-bldg/environmental/environmental.htm, in order to make them available free of charge to the public as part of the EPA-RTP campus environmental story.   The final work product shall become the property of the Government.  Period of Performance:  The period of performanceshall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) calendar days, commencing with award of contract and ending with final product delivery.  Up to four (4) weeks of EPA review time as noted above shall be included in this period.  Selection Criteria:  EPA will select a vendor based upon cost and technical factors so that the Agency receives the best value for this purchase, with technical factors being significantly more important than cost.   All proposals received in response to this request must include the following minimum technical elements and total cost.   The requirements for the selected contractor are that the offeror:  (1) Have highly qualified Key Personnel with individual and team experience, qualifications, and resumes; 2) Team Experience and Qualifications: a) In-depth working knowledge of green building materials and their availability and applicability in the marketplace, including life-cycle assessment and related decision tools.  a) Experience designing, specifying, and constructing green buildings, including LEED-rated facilities.  c) Expert knowledge of green building issues as they relate to design and construction, including the development and application of green building rating tools such as LEED, BREEAM, etc. d) Proven ability to effectively facilitate communication between stakeholders who develop, design, construct, own, operate, and occupy green buildings;   3) Have a sound Technical Approach, including a preliminary list of proposed Project Environmental Specification Sections and sample guidance document format; 4) Detailed Milestone Schedule; and 5) Past Performance: Please provide contact information for at least three recent customers (within the past three years) for similar work.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for Scallop and Habitat Surveys and is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical  Services.  The small business size standard is $6,000,000.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10643, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05.    A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. Statement of Work, Background, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL) recently described a framework and implementation plans for ecological effects research on aquatic stressors.  One goal of this research is to develop stressor-response relationships and models linking habitat alteration and loss to responses in bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) populations.  The Atlantic Ecology Division (AED) is developing these models for the bay scallop and needs data on bay scallop abundance and recruitment and the habitats associated with this species. Nantucket Harbor in Nantucket, MA has one of the only remaining healthy and well managed population of bay scallops on the east coast of the U.S. and is the ideal location to examine these organism/habitat relationships. Description of Work, Scope: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct dive surveys at 48 sites within Nantucket Harbor on two separate occasions - once in summer and fall 2005 for a total of 96 sampling events.  In addition, the contractor shall measure juvenile scallop abundance via settlement into spat bags and collect water samples for chlorophyll measurements.  The Atlantic Ecology Division will provide the contractor with the location (latitude and longitude in the form of Global Positioning system (GPS) coordinates) of the sampling sites within Nantucket Harbor. Technical Requirements: The contractor shall conduct dive surveys at each location and record the abundance and size of bay scallops, the abundance and size of associated predators, and record basic habitat information.  The habitat data to be provided are as follows:	Presence/absence of eelgrass, Canopy height of eelgrass, Eelgrass density estimate (such as percent cover or shoot density), Presence/absence of macroalgae, Sediment type, Water depth, Turbidity/seston estimates, Dissolved oxygen, Water temperature, Salinity, Water pH.The contractor shall collect the data for all parameters listed above.   In addition, the contractor shall collect water samples at each sampling location using a protocol provided by AED and transport samples to AED after collection.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR THE
ANNOTATION OF WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING OF STRAINS OF PATHOGENIC 
BACTERIA OF OPERATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
26 July 2005

1.0 INTRODUCTION:  

The Molecular and Advanced Biotechnology Branch of the Epidemiological Surveillance Division (SDE), Air Force Institute for Operational Health (AFIOH), Surveillance Directorate, Brooks City -Base, Texas provides scientific and technical support to the Department of Defense (DOD), US Army, US Navy, and US Air Force in garrison and field units in the development and validation of biotechnology as well as molecular biology-based assays for the rapid identification of diseases, infectious biological agents and toxins.  This effort targets the preceding stage to the development of primers/probes for identification of infectious agents that is, mapping the genome of the latter.  The map provides the scientists at AFIOH a databank of targets against these infectious agents. Unequivocal identification of pathogenic microorganisms are of vital importance for medical diagnostics and exacting molecular assays are urgently needed by the Air Force Biological Augmentation Teams (AFBAT) in support of both operational deployments and homeland security. Established and well-characterized off-the-shelf microcantilever technology provides a multifunctional, highly sensitive, real-time, DNA-based and/or immunospecific biological detector.  This system provides numerous advantages such as: high sensitivity and selectivity, low analyte volume, real time detection in fluids and/or gases, and the possibility to create portable or implantable microdevices.  

2.0 SCOPE:

The purpose of this effort is to obtain annotation of existing whole genomic bacterial sequences using state-of-art annotation software and annotation services. The information gained from the annotation will be used in the development of new assays. One of the primary missions of the Molecular and Advanced Biotechnology Division at AFIOH is to support the development of real-time diagnostic platforms using PCR-based molecular diagnostic methods (i.e. JBAIDS). There is a paucity of genomic information on these species of bacteria and there is an urgent need to expand the repertoire of probes that can be designed specifically to target these species. Such probes are needed as real-time diagnostic tools to be deployed immediately to our troops in theater as well as homeland defense support.

3.0 TASKS/TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

3.1 TASK 1- The complete annotated DNA sequence of at least two pathogenic microorganisms will be obtained and provide to the Molecular and Advanced Biotechnology Division of AFIOH for use in development assays.  The technology used will be state of the art annotation methodology and software from an outside services vendor.  The accuracy of the data must be >99% accurate. Design assays to the unique sequences identified here and optimize the assay to existing PCR platforms.

3.2 TASK 2- The data will be submitted in a form that can be used for publication in peer reviewed journals.  The contractor and AFIOH will work in a collaborative effort to accomplish the data package within four months of completing the last annotation project.

3.3 TASK 3- The results of the genomic annotation shall be summarized in a comprehensive technical report; however, the actual sequence will not be released to the contractor in a final report. This comprehensive report shall include an evaluation to determine requirements, deliverables, status, data gathering, data evaluation, findings and recommendations. 

4.0. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance for this order shall be effective  from the date of award.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

52.212-2 EVALUATION –COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government will select the best overall offer based on a comparative assessment of Price and Past Performance, whereby price may be traded off for past performance.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance (3) Price:  ADDENDUM to 52.212-2:  Evaluation Process:  General Information:  All offers received will be subject to an evaluation by a team that includes government personnel experienced in medical services.  The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government- price, and other factors considered.  However, if an offeror does not have relevant past performance history, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral, unknown, confidence rating.  In addition, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror and may be made without conducting discussions.  Consequently, offers, which do not conform to all the terms and conditions of this solicitation, may be considered unacceptable.  Technical Competency:  In order to be rated as acceptable.  Therefore, to be considered, an offeror must provide all the information and/or requirements listed below.  Failure to submit the listed requirements will result in the offeror’s technical aspect of the offer to be determined technically unacceptable.  Evaluation Criteria:  Knowledge Required by the Position:  (1) Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA), Registered health Information Technician (RHIT), Certified Coding Specialist (CCS), Certified Coding Specialist Physician (CCS-P), Certified Procedural Coder (CPC) or at least 3 years ambulatory medical coding experience contingent on his/her becoming registered or certified, at other than the Government’s expense, within one year of hire.  (2) Must have a basic understanding of Microsoft office programs of Word, Excel and PowerPoint. (3)  Must be proficient in the English language.  (4)  Any other requirement mentioned in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Past Performance Evaluation:  A minimum of 2 or 3 most recent Contracts performed by the offeror, similar in nature and magnitude to the work described in the PWS, either governmental or private/commercial entities.  The offeror will provide all the relevant information to enable the evaluation team to give the following ratings.  Exceptional- Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are clearly superior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record is so fundamentally sound that there is no doubt of the offeror’s ability to perform the requirement.  Very Good Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are above industry standards that would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  Satisfactory/Neutral  Based on the offeror’s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or no past performance record is available.  Marginal Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are below industry standards than would normally found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record presents significant doubt in the offeror’s ability to perform the requirement hence indicating a medium level of performance risk.  Unsatisfactory indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are clearly inferior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record is so fundamentally flawed that there is no doubt in the offeror’s inability to perform the requirement indicating a high level of performance risk.  Price Evaluation Factor:  For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the total price of all CLINS contained in the Schedule.  All offers must include prices for all line items. Failure to include all prices will exclude the offer from further consideration for award.  Evaluation Procedures:  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.  Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of each offer in terms of Technical Competency, Past Performance and Price.  Therefore, subjective judgment by the Government is implicit in the evaluation process.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to provide literature review, interviews and site visits.  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients whose cancer care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes. 

Statement of Work:

Technical Requirements:  A) The contractor shall submit a plan of work in the form of a Gantt chart with dates for each milestone and annotations for each milestone that includes personnel effort and other resources to be used;  B)  Capture and summarize what is known about cancer care quality through (A) review of published and “gray literature” on cancer care quality.  Review the published peer reviewed and non peer reviewed literature in commonly used databases (e.g., PubMed, nursing, health services) and summarize the findings as a literature review with complete citations with a particular emphasis on the period of cancer care from initial suspicion through diagnosis and plan of treatment.  The contractor shall acquire and review relevant articles and relevant references in those papers and search for and gather “grey” literature (e.g., reports and position papers by commissions; papers and websites of professional, health system or health plan, and advocacy organizations) on cancer care quality.  The contractor shall summarize findings of the literature review and provide copies of the relevant references.  An electronic draft of the summary shall be made available to the government for review and comment.  C)  Interview health policy experts, senior leadership and researchers.  The contractor shall conduct at least 15 interviews by phone or in person.  Each interview shall be scheduled for approximately 60 to 90 minutes.  Interviews.

D)  Conduct group interviews with practicing clinicians in several oncology specialties and cancer patients and/or family members of cancer patients.  The contractor shall conduct at least four group discussions, with each group organized around a specific topic or oncology specialty, for example, medical and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, oncology nursing, and/or patient/family experience.  The contractor shall develop the framework for individual and group discussion and meet with the government to finalize the specific criteria required for the framework and shall provide draft guides for review and comment by the government before any interviews take place.  Discussion topics for individual and/or group discussions shall include (but not be limited to) perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Both practicing oncologists and experts in health information and information technology shall be included in discussions about integrating patient and clinical data to facilitate the flow of information across settings of care and specialties.  The contractor shall include discussion about how to foster the use of health information systems for informed decision-making by patients and treating clinicians and what value this data might have for quality measurement and improvement.  The contractor shall provide to the government in draft form for review and comment a summary within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews and a summary of results within 60 calendar days after each group discussion.  The contractor shall cover the costs of travel for its personnel and for participatents in group discussions.    E)  Conduct site visits.  The contractor shall meet with the project officer to recommend the location and timing of site visits.  In this solicitation site visit means a geographic area.
