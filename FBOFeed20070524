<ARCHDATE>05232008
<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) proposes to correct safety deficiencies in the Deer Flat Upper Embankment Dam, located southwest of Nampa, Idaho. The purpose of the proposed project is to prevent failure of the embankment. Action is needed to correct internal erosion of the embankment material occurring along the Caldwell Canal outlet conduit, with a high potential to occur along the Nampa Canal outlet conduit both of which are located within the Upper Embankment Dam. The Caldwell Canal outlet works gate tower and outlet conduit structures are to be demolished and re-constructed.  The Nampa outlet conduit is to be modified. The Contractor will install sheetpiling in a previously placed emergency fill to provide safety and protection during removal of the dam embankment, gate tower, and outlet conduit, and reconstruction of the gate structure and outlet conduit.  The sheet pile/earth cofferdam is required to maintain reservoir operations during construction. At the conclusion of the outlet works and embankment construction the sheetpiling would be removed and salvaged. The cofferdam would be removed by excavator and material hauled to either an abandoned gravel pit on Refuge property north of the Refuge headquarters or to a commercial gravel pit. Dewatering wells will be installed within the cofferdam for control and removal of water from excavated areas and will be crucial to effective and timely achievement of the work.  Intensive environmental protection requirements must be accommodated for control and discharge of the effluent from dewatering and unwatering of the work areas inside of the cofferdam that hold back the impounded water of the reservoir.  A reservoir head of up to 25 feet with a storage capacity of 120,000 acre-feet will exist during construction.  Failure of the cofferdam could result in loss of life downstream. Major work items for the Caldwell Outlet Works portion of the project include: demolition of existing outlet works; drilling and installing dewatering wells approx. 1256 lin ft; furnishing, installing, and removing steel sheetpiles approx. 17,750 sq. ft.; excavation for new outlet works approx. 39,000 sq. yd; excavation of berm fill approx. 47,200 sq. yd.; furnishing and placing various embankment materials approx 23,920 sq.yd.; furnishing and installing prefabricated access bridge; furnishing and installing 12-inch HDPE drain pipe approx. 62 lin. ft.; removing existing paved riprap and furnishing and placing new riprap; furnishing and placing aggregate base course approx. 300 sq. yd; furnishing and placing new asphalt pavement approx 5420 sq. ft.; furnishing and placing concrete for various outlet works structures approx. 892 sq. yd; and, furnishing and placing masonry parapet wall approx. 245 lin. ft. furnishing and installing wetland water supply system.  Major work items for the Nampa Outlet Works portion of the project include: demolition of a 20-foot section of existing outlet works; excavation for outlet works modifications approx. 10,000 sq. yd.; furnishing and/or placing various embankment zone materials approx. 10,060 sq. yd.; furnishing and installing 12-inch HDPE drain pipe approx. 222 lin. ft.; furnishing and placing aggregate base course approx. 550 sq. yd.; furnish and place new asphalt pavement approx. 12,300 sq. ft.; furnishing and placing concrete for various structures approx. 107 sq. yd; and, furnishing and placing drilled dowels for concrete plugs and vault structure approx. 1100 lbs. This requirement requires approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which Reclamation is currently seeking. The RFP will specify the timing and availability of funds for the project. We anticipate issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) in June 2007 and offers will be due 45 days after the RFP is issued. Offerors will be evaluated on their proposed work plan, key personnel, successful past performance of similar requirements (with emphasis on installing and maintaining complex sheetpile/dewatering systems), price, and other factors. A formal site visit will be held after the RFP is issued. Prospective offerors are strongly urged to participate in the site visit. We plan to issue the RFP via the PN Regional Office's website at http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/index.html but certain security-sensitive drawings will only be issued via paper hard copy as they have been determined to be security-sensitive.  The security-sensitive drawings will only be mailed to offerors meeting the security standards that will be posted on the www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts website. Registration on the www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts website is strongly encouraged to assure that you receive convenient and prompt notification of amendments or other related correspondence and is required for offerors requesting the security-sensitive drawings. Only one copy of the security-sensitive drawings is available per offeror. A planholders list of offerors who've registered for the requirement at the website listed above will be available when the solicitation is issued and will be posted on the www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts website. Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted. An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov to receive contracts and purchase orders from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency. For this acquisition the small business size standard is $31 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods and the NAICS code is 237990 (Heavy Construction). This requirement is being conducted with full and open competition and it is NOT a set-aside. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Pre Solicitation Synopsis for Cryogenic Pressure Vessel Procurement For A3 Altitude Test Stand at NASA Stennis Space Center The NASA, John C. Stennis Space Center has recently been selected as the test site for the construction of a new A-3 Altitude Test Facility.  The new test facility will provide an altitude propulsion test capability which will enable the Constellation Programs Exploration Launch Office, J-2X Project Element to validate the performance of the J2-X engine for the upper stage of the new Ares I launch vehicle.  The A-3 Altitude Test Facility will be constructed for long term altitude rocket propulsion testing at Stennis Space Center.	  While the construction of the A-3 Altitude Facility will involve a significant number of individual procurement actions this requirement is solely focused on the  Cryogenic Pressure Vessels.  This pre-solicitation synopsis is to request industry feedback regarding the fabrication and delivery of five vacuum jacket cryogenic storage vessels to Stennis Space Center.  Due to program schedule milestones the vessels shall be fabricated in a concurrent process.  Additionally, NASA is requesting information regarding suggested methods of shipping & installation of the 60,000 gallon and 130,000 gallon cryogenic storage vessel i.e. (Can they be fabricated entirely at the manufacturers facilities & shipped to SSC, or is field assembly required?).  SSC has access to river barge traffic as a means of transportation. Also, NASA SSC requests industry input regarding schedule performance for these vessels.  What is a reasonable expected period of performance? The proposed vessels are as described: 	60,000 Gallon LOX Vessel (1 required) 	Vacuum Jacketed Vessel (stainless inner wall, carbon steel outer wall) 	60,000 gallons nominal capacity 	20 foot outer diameter 	250 psig MAWP 	130,000 Gallon LH2 Vessel (1 required) 	Vacuum Jacketed Vessel (stainless inner wall, carbon steel outer wall) 	130,000 gallons nominal capacity 	20 foot outer diameter 	100 psig MAWP 	35,000 Gallon LOX Vessel (3 required) 	Vacuum Jacketed Vessel (stainless inner wall, carbon steel outer wall) 	35,000 gallons nominal capacity 	13-15 foot outer diameter (tank manufacturer to determine) 	850 psig design pressure This synopsis should not be construed as a formal request for proposals but, rather a pre-solicitation synopsis requesting information under the authority of FAR 15.201.  Responses to this request for information are not offers and cannot be accepted by NASA to form a binding contract.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	 NASA does not intend to award contracts at this time, but will use information obtained for market analysis and to plan future procurements.  NASA desires that those companies expressing an interest in the aforementioned synopsis provide a written submission of  (Statement of Capabilities) that address high-level alternatives and general, market-based approaches for performing the functions described in this synopsis.  NASA would prefer that the written submissions not contain confidential business or financial information relating to specific companies. All prospective companies are reminded to direct their written electronic correspondence to the attention of: Jake Jacobs at james.e.jacobs@nasa.gov.  Those prospective companies shall have their Statements of Capabilities submitted and received at Stennis Space Center no later than June 4, 2007 at 3:pm CST.	Faxed correspondence and telephone correspondence will not be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), Library Services and Content Management (LSCM), Library Technical Information Services (LTIS) seeks to acquire bibliographic metadata transcription services for ca. 600,000 3 x 5 catalog cards in its 1,000,000 card historic shelflist collection.   These cards contain brief bibliographic metadata captured as part of the cataloging activity for the Cataloging and Indexing (C&I) Program and the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) from ca. 1870s until the shelflist officially closed in October 1992.  GPO?s goal is to convert the bibliographic data on these cards into machine-readable records in MARC21 format so that they can be loaded to GPO?s Integrated Library System (ILS) (Aleph 500) catalog.  

LSCM manages the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications formerly known as the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP). The unit catalogs in all formats published by all three branches of the U.S. Government in accordance with 44, U.S.C., Section 1710-1711.  Documents in the National Bibliography are available through the online CGP (http://catalog.gpo.gov).

2.	   Approach

The successful offeror will be directed by GPO to perform the work in a phased approach, as laid out in this RFP, although later phases may not be required, depending on the priorities set by the GPO.   Each phase will be completed over four option years after the initial phase is completed in the first year.  Offerors will provide a plan for one year?s worth of work on the bibliographic metadata transcription process not to exceed $100,000. Offerors should also provide a proposal for the four option years.  

The successful offeror will be required to transcribe a test batch of approximately 200 cards into MARC 21 records for evaluation before work begins on the project in full.  The evaluation of the test batch will help determine the best and most efficient workflow approach, and allow GPO to validate the metadata transcription requirements outlined in this RFP. 

Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, Mrs. Albertha Broadnax on 202-512-0966 or at abroadnax@gpo.gov.

<DESC>The 2d Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure approximately twenty-four (24) maintenance technicians (CONUS and OCONUS) and approximately eighteen (18) maintenance training Instructor/Technician services to support the MV-22 program.  It is the intent of the government to procure these services from Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office, 401 Tiltrotor Dr, Amarillo, TX, on a sole source basis using a contract with a one (1) year base period and two (2) Option years beginning 1 September 2007. Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office maintains the proprietary technical data and engineering rights to provide Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) technical reach back capability for the MV-22 Program. Bell-Boeing Joint Office is the only company that has the capability and capacity to train both MV-22 Instructors and Technicians.  Bell-Boeing can train instructors at its facilities using production assets while providing assistance in resolving unforeseen system/subsystem issued directly from the OEM Engineering and manufacturing personnel.  As potential proprietary data rights issues arise, as ones associated with composite materials in the airframe, both CONUS and OCONUS, Bell-Boeing can give immediate assistance in resolving the issue expeditiously.   An official RFP will not be released on the basis that it contains proprietary technical data from the MV-22.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the release of its updated DRAFT Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) solicitation with Sections L and M.  This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition. Contract award is anticipated in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008. This DRAFT SOLICITATION and its attached documents/exhibits will be listed at the website "Doing Business with NAVAIR", http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations and the Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) website, http://pma213.navair.navy.mil/systems/jpals.htm. JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that are more affordable, function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with our allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. The JPALS capability will be incrementally acquired and incorporated into the DoD inventory of warfighting assets. Sea Based JPALS has been designated as Increment 1. The program is scheduled for a Milestone B decision in the 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 with Sea Based JPALS (Increment 1) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) planned for FY14. The proposed system architecture will be driven by the requirements and constrained by the program schedule and affordability goals contained in the solicitation and in the JPALS Systems Requirements Document (SRD). Interested parties can view/download the Draft RFP N00019-07-R-0044) including its attachments: SOO, DD254, GFI List and GFI documents, and the Contract Data Requirements List (Data Items A001 through A115).  The SRD and the JPALS Security Classification Guide is available at the JPALS website or you may request a copy by contacting the PCO, Ms. Lynda Frattone at the email or telephone number referenced below. *Note: Current SRD revision (4) incorporates threshold requirements for Sea Based Increment 1. An update to SRD revision (4) now includes objective performance for availability in a jamming environment and auto land capability. This update is available at the JPALS website referenced above. Further, SRD revision (5), available in June 2007, will incorporate a Land-Based reference document for growth considerations. Exclusive of the above information posted on the NAVAIR website and the JPALS website, potential offerors must request a copy of the JPALS classified Annex A from the Government. Points of contact for the written request are below. The request must include the company name, classified mailing address, CAGE code, e-mail address, Facility Secuirty Officer name and telephone number, and point of contact with telephone number.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Remediation Services at various locations in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and other DoD sites nationwide.  The resulting contracts will be firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), environmental multiple award contracts (EMAC).

This procurement is unrestricted for competition amongst all interested firms.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Service.  The contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one year options periods.  The minimum guarantee for each contract is $5000.  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract.  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the resulting contract(s) shall not exceed $100,000,000.  The Government intends to award without discussions.

This contract focuses primarily on services for performing remedial actions at environmentally contaminated sites.  The sites will consist of those ranked on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL) as well as non-NPL sites regulated under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Underground Storage Tanks (UST), Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP), State environmental regulatory programs and other sites, which might require remedial action. This contract focuses primarily on environmental restoration projects but could involve other environmental work such as compliance projects.

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible firm(s) whose proposals, conform to the solicitation, and are determined the "Best Value" to the Government based on cost and noncost factors.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contract(s) with the minimum guarantee of $5000 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factor 1-Past Performance; Factor 2-Commitment to Socio-Economic Programs; Factor 3-Specialized Experience; Factor 4-Safety; Factor 5-Engineering and Management Approach(PTO 0001); and Factor 6-Price Proposal (PTO 0001).  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than Factor 6-Cost/Price.  While cost/price to the Government is a consideration, it will not be the overriding basis for contract award.  The proposed cost/price and other non-price factors will be evaluated to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price proposal.

A pre-proposal site visit for the Proposed Task Order 0001 project will be held at the Naval Base Point Loma (NBPL), San Diego, CA.  The address is Admiral Kidd Club and Conference Center, 33050 Acoustic Ave., Bldg. A3, San Diego, CA 92147.  The site visit will be conducted on 23 April 2007 at 8:00AM PST.  All firms interested in attending the site visit must submit the following information by email to gina.snider@navy.mil no later than 16 April 2007 at 2:00 PM PST:  Full name of individual(s) attending, company name, phone number, and last four of your social security number.  Individuals not registered by 16 April 2007 will not be able to attend.  All individuals attending the site visit must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent resident (green card).  For access to the site, all individuals must have a government-issued identification on them (i.e. drivers license, passport) and lawful permanent residents must have their green card.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.  

The solicitation will be available by electronic media only and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or http://www.fbo.gov under pre-solicitation notice N62473-07-R-3212.

Offeror(s) must be registered in the Contractor's Central Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov in order to participate in this procurement.  

The solicitation issue date is on or about 5 April 2007.  The closing date set for receipt of proposals is 8 May 2007, 2:00 p.m. local time.

In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 07 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB and .13% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Information Services (OIS) has recently deployed the Microsoft (MS) Office Professional Suite 2003 to all agency desktops.  The next phase in the process is the conversion and comparison for accuracy of existing agency documents needed for ongoing agency business.  Also, there is a requirement for the modification and/or development of agency-supported macros and templates for agency correspondence in MS Word.  This is in support of meeting the Agency goal of declaring MS Word the Agency Standard word processor in August 2007.  Currently NRC has requested each Office to identify the number of documents that will need to be converted.  In support of this requirement, the Contractor shall porvide a proposal detailing the cost for providing services and support to complete this task.  The NRC estimates that the number of documents to be converted is between 5,000 and 45,000 documents.  The NRC has completed a ?document inventory? assessment of the current document types, letterhead formats, macros and word processing environments. The Contractor shall provide initial project planning and migration strategy service that will include:  (1)  an analysis of agency documents to be converted using a document matrix as the basis of the anticipated work volume.  The listing of documents for review will be provided by the NRC; (2) a conversion schedule; and (3) recommended methods and media as to which all documents will be submitted to the contractor and the methods and media the converted documents will be returned to NRC.  The Contractor shall propose the following requirements and/or elements: (1) conversion and comparison for accuracy of existing agency documents from Corel WordPerfect (Versions 8 through X3) to Microsoft Word 2003.  As part of your response, please provide information regarding any 3rd party solution that may be recommended for this conversion;  (2) the conversion process must maintain quality, integrity, and characteristics of the Corel WordPerfect document and convert completely to the MS Word document; (3) the conversion/development process must maintain quality, integrity, and characteristics of the Corel WordPerfect macro and/or template and integrate completely with MS Word; (4) the conversion process must be completed utilizing an automated and/or manual solution that will guarantee an accurate end product; (5) the modification of existing or creation of new standardized MS Word templates and macros. These templates and macros will be used for agency wide standard business correspondence; and (6) weekly progress reports to be provided during weekly status meetings.  A project manager shall be assigned to oversee the assigned resources and make sure the project plan is executed to meet milestones and deliverables. The project manager shall be responsible for managing and controlling project scope, budget, objectives, risks, and all deliverables. The project manager shall work closely with the NRC project manager on all aspects of the project and project plan. Weekly status meetings with the NRC project manager and Contractor project manager will be required for the duration of the conversion process. Offers will be evaluated on the following evaluation criteria:  (1) PAST PERFORMANCE  (35 points) - The contractor has performed exact or very similar tasks for other Federal entities in the past 18 months.  And such performance was rated as excellent by the client in all categories to include approach, staffing, quality and timeliness.  (2) SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE (40 points) - The efficacy of the skill mix, qualifications, and experience of the personnel resources the contractor intends to utilize for meeting each deliverable will be evaluated against the intended outcome of the deliverable i.e., hands on work versus theory.  The depth and quality of the proposed resources in performing similar work is paramount. (3) PROJECT MANAGMENT AND APPROACH (25 points) - The extent to which the offeror?s proposed approach demonstrates the viability of the proposed strategies and methodologies in meeting the objectives of the tasks. The extent to which the tools/ methodologies used by the contractor for project management activities ensure the schedules will be met and the plan for keeping the NRC apprized of progress in solving the identified weaknesses/deficiencies will be considered. The Government estimates a Level of Effort (LOE) of 7,600 hours. However, this information is advisory and is not to be considered as the sole basis for the staffing plan or cost proposal.  The period of performance is approximately eight months, though the bulk of the required work is to be completed on or before August 31, 2007.  The NRC intends to award without discussions.  However, the Agency may hold discussions and request revised offers, if necessary.  All questions concerning this request for proposal shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist in writing by e-mail to VMW@NRC.GOV, no later than 3:00 p.m. local time on May 31, 2007.

Proposals for the follow-on contract are currently being evaluated utilizing full and open competition procedures. This notice is not a request for proposals and no contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received as a result of this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined/solicitation for Request for Quotation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ7061 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-16).  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intend to procure a Dual Multiphoton Upgrade Hardware Pulsed Laser to be coupled to an existing Leica TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope already equipped in the lab. The multiphoton imaging on the SP5 confocal is limited to simultaneous detection of two dyes.  The 4 channel detector will allow the simultaneous detection of 4 wavelengths and still limited by the availability of only a single tunable excitation wavelength.  The confocal microscope is coupled to several lasers and has an array of external detectors.  In order to expand the capabilities of one of the existing microscopes we have proposed to couple a second Mai Tai Ultrafast Pulsed Laser to the microscope.  The Contractor shall provide parts, software, and specialized calibration tools to accomplish this upgrade.  The Contractor shall provide all beam routing optics between the ultrafast pulsed lasers and the confocal scanhead, EOM and EOM controller, shutters and shutter control, optics safety box, software to control the dual laser system switching from within the Leica Sp5 software (LASAF current version 1.6) and installation of the hardware and software to make system operational.    This upgrade must have both lasers and EOM modules must be controlled from within the current Leica confocal software package.  The upgrade  shall include  providing the appropriate dialog boxes within the LASAF software to allow for configuration of each of the lasers and EOMs independently.  This upgrade will allow for frame by frame switching, and if possible line by line switching between lasers.  This upgrade shall not interface with the visible light scanning operation of the existing SP5 confocal microscope, or with the use of a single ultrafast pulsed laser as the excitation source for FLIM studies on the microscope.  NIAID will provide the additional MAI TAI laser, and a table suitable for the mounting of components.  The contractor purchase price must include Six (6) months warranty which includes parts and labor to cover defects in manufacturing and excludes wear and consumable items.  The Contractor shall assume the costs of any realignment necessary to incorporate this laser into the existing system, if the laser does not match the existing one exactly.  The cost of alignment of other multiphoton system in the lab affected by this installation shall be the responsibility of the laser vendor.    The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) Code for this acquisition is 334516, and the small-business size standard is 500.  This is a firm fixed-price contract and the FOB term is 'Destination' and Net 30.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders, Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds, FAR 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor Registration.  All responses received will be considered by the agency.  In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award.]  Offers must be submitted no later than 4:00 P.M.

<DESC>The DCMA at Boeing Philadelphia, PA intends to negotiate and award a time and materials delivery order to procure technical support services for the CH-46 helicopter, under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0012.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance for this effort is 12 months after contract award and the work will be performed at Boeing Helicopters in Ridley Park, PA.  The Government intends to award a contract with Boeing for the design, test, and qualification of a modification of the engine condition control box, P/NBCL 20-5. All changes to the ECCB will be designed and qualified to original Logic Spa P/N BCL 20-5 design specifications.  The engine condition control system performs engine power management and engine torques matching functions and is a flight critical item. This order will develop changes to the ECCB would be incorporated into the internal circuit card and could be retrofit Navy assets. The ECCB will be modified in such a manner where potentiometers adjusted to a null position fall in a travel range that reflects a -16 fuel control instead of the current -10 fuel control.  This change must be done without losing existing adjustment fidelity and without inducing torque splits.  Nulling of the START potentiometer shall result in an actuator rotation of 16 degrees.  This modification shall have no effect on the travel range capabilities of the FLY, MID and MAX adjustments.  The ECCB circuitry will also be modified in such a manner where the Fail Freeze circuitry will recognize a failure of the ECL potentiometer and associated wiring even when the ECL is in the FLY position The final aspect of the modification for to ECCB circuitry in such a manner that selection of the manual trim reset switch in the cockpit also results in reset back to beep nominal condition.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for the purchase of a  Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 Microscope; AxioObserver Optics; AxioObserver Fluorescence and; AxioObserver Incubation with Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Once Zeiss Drive; Thornwood, New York, 10594.  

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The salient characteristics apply to the Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 Microscope, AxioObserver Optics; AxioObserver Fluorescence and; AxioObserver Incubation instruments:  Microscope Dimensions: Height 646 mm or 26 inches, Width 396mm or 16 inches, Length 613mm or 25 inches.  Incubator Height 646 mm or 26 inches; width to 631mm to 26 inches, Length 613mm or 25 inches.

AxioObserver Stand and Accessories:

-	TFT touch screen to visualize present working conditions on the microscope; 
-	Docking Station for TFT Touch screen with Z-Focus control and x-y guide control of motorized Can-Bus;
-	Ergonomically and convenient placement of functional buttons 
-	Motorized Z-focus with a step size of 10nm; 
-	Improved Aquastop II (= patented water deflection/collection system) to better fit motorized and manual nosepieces; 
-	Contrastmanager to automatically select the preset optimal contrast conditions per objective; 
-	Motorized Can-Bus Stage with removable x-y guide; 
-	Ability to insert an Apotome and do structural sectioning to eliminate background fluorescence. 

AxioObserver Optics:

-	DIC with an MgF2 plate to ensure homogeneity and precise pixel recognition in Fluorescence and DIC (no pixel shift). 

AxioObserver Fluorescence:

-	Fluorescence Beampath: Apochromatic correction where red, green and blue all image in the same plane; 
-	Exchange of Push & Click Fluorescent cubes without taking the whole revolver out. 

AxioObserver Incubation:

Justification:  

The NCI is interested in the genetic changes that define metastasis. The Carl Zeiss microscope will allow us to visualize changes in motility in vitro and assessment of tissue samples ex vivo, two elements that are crucial in monitoring the changes that allow for metastasis.  The Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope has the capability to go beyond the limits of the fluorescent microscope currently being used by the NCI.  Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the salient characteristics required of a microscope that can aid the NCI with its research; investigates genetic changes that define metastasis and signal transduction pathway for sarcoma cells survival and studies the role of oncogenes, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and downstream effector molecules in activation and proliferation.  

Benefit

The Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 will allow NCI to image and record real time data of single cells in response to genetic modification or chemical agents.  Currently the only option is to take images of cells before and after treatment, without the ability to monitor what happens to the cells during treatment.  In addition, the visualization of tumor cells in live small animals is currently not possible.  The inverted format of the microscope will allow NCI to place a small animal on the microscope for direct visualization.  This will allow NCI to test the ability of drugs to destroy cancer cells.  The drugs that we identify can then be used in treatment of cancer in humans.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on June 4, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-70063-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Any res ponse to this notice must be submitted in writing to the government and show clear and convincing evidence that another system is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the governme nt.

Additionally, water flow through this area during operation of the camera requires a streamlined shape that minimizes flow induced vibration and movement.  The camera shall be an Inukton Spectrum 90 PTZ (WISL00008) or approved equal.  ADMINISTRATION:  North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the size standard is less than 750.  In order for contractors to conduct business with  the Department of Defense, the contractor must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<DESC>The US General Services Administration, Northeast & Caribbean Region intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a two-phase award of multiple firm-fixed price contracts to successful offerors to provide for an upgraded Smart Card Reader Terminal, to ultimately replace the existing Smart Card Reader Terminal to an existing Physical Access Control System (PACS).  In Phase One, the proposed acquisition shall require all necessary Engineering, Furnishing, Installation, Security, Testing, and Documentation of the smart card reader upgrade to the existing physical access control system.  The functional interface capabilities of the reader must include Contact and Contact less, PIN/Keypad, and Biometric (fingerprint).  The smart card reader must be able to read multiple card formats, including legacy smart cards (based on GSC-IS v2.0) currently in use.  The smart card reader must be compliant with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 and associated special publications (like NIST Special Publication 800-76 Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification).  Upon Government acceptance of an offeror(s?) fully operational smart card reader that is in full compliance with all specifications listed, for the second phase, the offeror(s) will then be issued an RFP for the replacements, additional spares, and maintenance requirement to replace the existing Smart Card Reader Terminal to the existing PACS, fully and wholly integrated with the PACS software as a fully operational and functional system. The GSA intends to award up to three contracts. The contractor(s) shall perform all work necessary to ensure complete day-to-day performance operational capabilities of the new Smart Card Reader Terminals, to be incorporated into existing ACS Optical Portals.  The spares award will provide for future quantity acquisition of spare parts and additional readers as needed by the GSA and other Government agencies.  The accepted Terminals resulting from Phase one award must be listed on the GSA Approved Products List (APL) at the time of Implementation/full deployment and Cutover Process to be eligible for award in Phase two.  This procurement is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED requirement.    The applicable NAICS Code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement shall be procured under Best value continuum, employing the source selection process, lowest priced technically acceptable methodology IAW FAR Subpart 15.101-2.  The evaluation factors for this requirement will include the following:  Technical approach and capabilities, Management Approach, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government reserves the right not to convene discussions with successful offerors.  All offerors, whose proposals have been evaluated to be the highest rated in technical, and whose proposed prices were determined to be fair and reasonable for award, may be subject to a background check prior to receiving an award.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 31 May 2007.  The duration of initial phase of the requirement is approximately 60 calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan is required for all large firms for awards greater than $550,000.00. A site visit is scheduled for the week of 11 June 2007.  All interested parties may submit their inquiries to Ed Lew via e-mail at edward.lew@gsa.gov and to Peter Han at peter.han@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from eligible and qualified firms/organizations to provide grants and financial management services in support of a multi-donor funded Civil Society Funding Mechanism (CSFM) activity that provides grants to indigenous organizations in support of activities scaling up effective and comprehensive responses to HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), Tuberculosis and Malaria in Uganda.  The contractor will serve as the financial management agent (FMA) for the Civil Society Funding Mechanism (CSFM).
 
The contractor will be contractually accountable to USAID. However, the contractor will also be responsible to the participating donor agencies for successful management of their individual and pooled funds as outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between the participating donors.  
 
The goal of the CSFM is to facilitate civil society to make greater and more effective contributions to the goals and priorities outlined in the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV/AIDS, the National Strategic Programme Plan of Implementation (NSPPI) for OVC and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) II for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB.  The purpose of the CSFM is to attract joint funds and disburse them swiftly and efficiently to civil society organizations to enable scaled up and effective comprehensive responses to HIV/AIDS, OVC, TB and Malaria. The CSFM allows for decision-making and allocation of collective resources based on analysis of gaps and local priorities, and is supposed to reduce the administrative burdens on both donors and civil society partners. 
  
This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for this activity is 935. 
 
This RFP is expected to be issued o/a February 8, 2007 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website. Any amendments to this solicitation will also be issued and posted on this website.   All questions regarding this solicitation should be directed through the mechanism provided on the FedBizOpps website.

The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the U.S. Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation. See Note(s) 1, 22, 23 and 26.

  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all

  under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this 
  synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the 
  Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR A PULSED AND CHIRPED TERAHERTZ COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM which was posted on May 23, 2007. You are notified that the following changes are made: The draft specifications set forth in the synopsis are hereby replaced by the following updated draft. General: The contractor shall build, deliver, and install a turn key time-domain Pulsed and Chirped (spectroscopic) terahertz computed tomography system according to the specifications started below. Terahertz nondestructive evaluation is an emerging technology and becoming of increasing importance in the inspection world. Generation and detection of Pulsed and Chirped T-rays involves femtosecond laser pulses, which power paired photoconductive transducers. Terahertz radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum lying between microwaves and the far-IR. This region has frequencies ranging from 0.1  10 THz and wavelengths from 3 mm to 0.03 mm.  NASA desires to have a Pulsed and Chirped broadband Terahertz computed tomography system to virtually slice materials and build up 3D volumetric visualizations similar to what is done with Xray computed tomography. NASAs interest in this technology will relate to characterizing dielectric materials for thermal protection systems (foams and tiles) for exploration and hypersonic systems, seals for Crew Exploration Vehicle, and structural applications such as Kevlar-based COPV (composite overwrap pressure vessel).   Similar to x-ray images, THz wavelengths penetrate through most materials and can easily reveal imperfections such as voids, cracks, and density variations. THz offers some advantages over x-ray including that the radiation is non-ionizing and thus is completely safe. Example imaging applications include flaw detection in the sprayed-on-foam-insulation (SOFI) for the space shuttle program, detection of threat objects in checked airline baggage and stand-off detection of threat objects in packages or on people.  NASA is open to creative ways to provide 3-D terahertz imaging including but is focused for now on the pulsed and chirped tomographic method (ref. 1) as follows. Mandatory Items: 1.The source should be terahertz broadband capability between 0.1 and 3 THz. Depth and lateral resolution within a cross-sectional slice plane should be 1 mm or better. 2.Pulsed and Chirped probe modes should be available. The chirped probe mode greatly accelerates the speed of the scan according to ref. 1. 3.The system should work in both through-transmission and single-sided back-scatter (pulse-echo) mode, and allow image slices to be formed at the various frequencies in the band.  Additionally, the system should allow operation in a 2-d mode similar so that an image can be obtained similar to a 2-d digital radiograph.  4.Signal-to-noise ratio shall be nominally 100:1 or better at peak frequency and 50:1 at Full-width half max frequency points. 5.In pulsed mode, data acquisition rate can be variable but would need to be as high as 6.4 THz. The waveform time length acquired can be variable but shall be as large 2048 points (320 psec). 6. The sample positioning system shall have stepper motors and controllers capable of 10 micrometer steps in the vertical and horizontal directions and less than or equal to 1 degree of rotation in the plane of the cross-sectional slice. 360 degrees of rotation is desired. 7. The speed of scan should be such that data at at least 10 scan positions per second can be obtained. 8. The largest practical sample size that can be inspected based on the experience of the vendor / manufacturer can be communicated to NASA. 9. Slice reconstructions should be possible using peak amplitude, peak time, peak phase, peak magnitude, time-domain centroid, magnitude and phase as a function of frequency, and frequency-domain centroid.  The reconstruction time should be optimized. 10. Both terahertz waveform and image slice data should be viewable on the display and control software native to the system, and also exportable as raw data and to various data formats for use with popular 3d visualization programs such as 3D doctor and custom formats to be specified by NASA.  Raw data format specification must be provided so that NASA can write translation programs for use with NASA custom-developed software. 11. Deconvolving / deblurring image processing software such as weiner filtering shall be available as part of the system. 12. The system should be operable with a Windows XP or Windows Vista-based PC of 3 GHz Dual Pentium (or equivalent) or greater. The system software shall be in English. 13. The system shall have 1 terabyte of hard-drive storage capability. 14. Calibration test standards must be provided that demonstrate the spatial resolution in both tomography modes and 2-d mode. 15. Laser safety issues must be specified and recommendations provided. 16. The system shall be demonstrated to meet above specifications on-site at vendor location with NASA representative present.  17. A maintenance and repair contract shall be provided for the first year after acceptance of this system. 18.  The offeror shall provide two (2) days of training for two NASA researchers during or immediately following the installation period. 19. The installation shall be completed with four weeks from the time of delivery. 20. Complete documentation (two sets of each of the operation manuals, blueprints, separate components specifications, and troubleshooting manuals), i.e., sufficient information for the Government researcher to fix and troubleshoot problems that are not classified as proprietary issues in order to keep the system functioning. Reference:  1. Wang, S. and Zhang, X-C., Pulsed terahertz tomography. Topical Review. J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 (2004).	Specifically see pgs. R18  R25 dealing with the pulsed and chirped probe modes for the tomography system. The due date for responses is not extended.

For a 4" diameter filter paper with 3.25" active collection area placed directly on the detector end cap, the absolute efficiency for 10 keV x-rays must be at least 5%. 2.	Energy resolution must be good enough to distinguish 13.6 keV Pu x-rays from the 14.4 keV Co-57 gamma. 3.	The  system must have provisions for electronically storing gamma spectrum files for subsequent analysis, in a format that can be imported and used by the commercially available gamma spectrometry analytical software currently supplied by all major vendors. 4.	The system must be fully capable of meeting  all applicable requirements of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC) 2003 Standards The specifications below are believed by EPA to be necessary to meet the above functional requirements for the intended application, but alternatives will be considered, provided  that offerors can demonstrate how a proposed alternative will meet the functional requirements.  1.	The equipment must be warranted to be free of defects in material and workmanship for at least one year from the time of delivery.  The warranty must provide for repair or replacement at no cost to  the government, and shall not require the government to pay for shipping or handling costs for return of defective equipment for repair.  Software shall be expressly warranted to be fit and suitable for the purpose for which it is provided and that it will operate satisfactorily on the platform  specified; disclaimers of warranty of fitness for purpose are unacceptable. 2.	Documentation provided with equipment shall include instruction manuals that completely describe how to set up, configure, calibrate, maintain, and use the equipment furnished, both hardware and software. Schematic and  component layout drawings shall be provided for all circuit boards.  Assembly drawings shall be provided for all mechanical assemblies.  All drawings shall identify components by part number and be accompanied by part lists that include all components shown in the drawings.  This documentation may  be provided either in printed form, or on CD-ROM in portable document format (PDF) files. 3.	Delivery must be FOB the National Air and Radiation Laboratory, Montgomery AL.  All shipping and handling costs shall be included in the base price of the instrument. 4.	The detector shall be coaxial High  Purity Germanium (HPGE) with integral signal pre-amplifier:  	The detector diameter shall be at least 80 mm, and the ratio of the diameter to the length shall be at least 2.25.  	The entrance window shall be sufficiently thin to provide a useful lower energy range of 10 keV or lower.  The upper  useful energy range should extend to at least 200 keV.  Relative efficiencies at energies greater than 200 keV are unimportant.  	Energy resolution shall be at least 600 eV FWHM at 14.4 keV and at least 650 eV at 122 keV. 5.	The cooling system may be either a cryostat with 30 L liquid nitrogen  dewar, or a mechanical cooler.  The cryostat must be vertical dipstick, or if a mechanical cooler is proposed, it must be physically compatible with shield assemblies designed for use with a vertical dipstick cryostat.  If a mechanical cooler is proposed, the required power supply must be single  phase 115 VAC (normal U.S. household current), and the device must be capable of achieving a detector operating temperature low enough, and of limiting microphonic effects from vibration, such that detector resolution is not significantly less than if cooled with liquid nitrogen. 6.	Supporting  electronics for the detector shall be provided.  Discrete or integrated components using either analog or digital signal processing are acceptable, but must provide all of the functions required for a fully functioning high resolution gamma spectrometry system, including but not limited to:  	High  Voltage detector bias  	Detector pulse shaping, amplification, and processing  	A Multi-channel analyzer with minimum conversion gain of 4096 channels  	All interconnecting cables and/or interface adapters as required to have a fully functioning system that is interfaced with and controlled by a  Personal Computer  7.	The supporting electronics shall be controlled by computer software, which must be included in the offerors quote.  The software must run on an i386-based Personal Computer with a Windows XP Service Pack 2 operating system.  The software must be capable of:  	controlling the  functions of the detector and supporting electronics as required for gamma spectrum acquisition  	saving the resultant gamma spectrum as an electronic file, in a format that can be imported and used by the currently available gamma spectrometry analysis software from all major vendors.  The file  format specified in ANSI N42.42 is preferred.  	If any third-party, commercial, off-the-shelf software is required for operation, the software shall be included in the quotation and provided by the contractor. 8.	A shield fabricated with low background materials shall be provided for the detector  to reduce background gamma radiation.  The mechanical design of the shield shall accommodate the proposed detector and cooling system.  It shall have internal dimensions sufficient to accommodate a 4L marinelli beaker and shall provide shielding equivalent to at least 3 inches of lead.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB. 	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreeme nt (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil 	The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be de termined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst, 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required 	The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suture. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $418,933.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-mon th period.  	At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informatio n, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors 	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior  to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   	This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for  resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria 	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.   	Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the tec hnical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  	Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment F acilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB h as set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. T he Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  	Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total  requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. 	Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option period s (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation 	The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1)  the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or service s offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.) 1.	Does your company manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of suture? 2.	Are your products available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health? 3.	What is your DAPA number for this product line? 4.	Under what brand(s) does your company manufacture or distribute your product? 5.	Under what standards is your product manufactured? 6.	Under what regulatory and/or advisory agency are your products classified? Are your products approved by these agencies? 7.	Please provide a list of the prod ucts your company offers for this product line. 8.	Are your products latex free? 9.	What types of educational tools or materials do you have for this product line? 10.	What kind of staff training does your company provide? 11.	Does your company provide 24/7 customer service? 12.	Is there any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line? If yes, please provide dates and duration, cause, and resolution. 13.	Product meets all requirements as set forth by the US Pharmacopeia for Sutures? 2. Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.  1.	Product is easy to identify from package. 2.	Expiration date is easily visible on individual package 3.	Product is easy to open 4.	Product  allows for aseptic delivery to a sterile field 5.

<SUBJECT>R -- Administrative Support Services for the NIH Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>263-2007-M(GO)-0166
<RESPDATE>061107
<CONTACT>Zedekiah Worsham, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-3560, Fax 301-451-5372, Email worshamz@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting market research to determine the capabilities of all businesses (large and small) interested in the opportunity described below.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000. Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist NIH in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources; however, all size organizations are encouraged to respond. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) will apply. 

This requirement is to obtain administrative services on a long term basis across all of the NIH Institutes, Divisions, and Centers and Offices. This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent. This requirement will likely be a multiple award contract. The potential contractors for this acquisition will be required to provide up to 500 administrative support personnel gradually over a 5 year period. Since administrative support demand will vary, contractors must be able to scale accordingly. Services required will be performed in a scientific research environment; therefore, administrative personnel should have some experience or familiarity working in such a field. 

A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is included with this Sources Sought. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the accompanying DRAFT SOW to become familiar with the requirements of this project.

To make a reasonable determination of available capabilities and vendor interest in responding to this solicitation for administrative support services, NIH asks that vendors review the requirements outlined in the DRAFT SOW and respond with their intent on proposing. In general, while this Sources Sought is not a request for a technical proposal, respondents should provide enough information for NIH to make a determination that the vendor has the capability to perform the same or similar work as identified in the attached DRAFT SOW. 

Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages for sections one (1) through four (4) of the below. Sections five (5) and six (6) are together limited to no more than 5 pages and shall be a separate attachment from sections one (1) through four (4):

1.	Business Information  

a.	Company name
b.	Company address
c.	D&B Duns Number
d.	Socio-economic classification of company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, serviced disabled veteran owned, Hubzone, large business, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Note: All vendors who wish to be awarded a Government contract must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.
e.	Size (gross revenue, number of employees in company)
f.	Number of years in existence
g.	Company point of contact - name, phone and email address
h.	List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer. References must be relevant to the requirement and work must have been performed within the three years prior to May 24, 2007. 
i.	NIH encourages teaming or subcontracting arrangements among vendors. If the vendor has any existing or prior teaming arrangements with other vendors to provide this type service, please briefly identify these arrangements and the percentage of work completed by the responding vendor and its subcontractor. Example: 
Vendor ABC acted as the prime and Vendor XYZ provided support as a subcontractor on a contract providing administrative support services to a large federal agency. The contract involved XX positions and the services provided were divided as follows:
Vendor ABC (Prime)	      	                        51%
Vendor XYZ (Subcontractor)	                        49%

2.	Vendor's Capabilities 

A description of the vendor's capabilities to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and the attached DRAFT SOW. As demand for administrative support may vary, please include any approaches the company may have used in other contracts (with government or commercial customers) of similar scope to satisfy the surge needs of other clients. 

3.	Management Approach 

The proposed solicitation will not be a personal services contract, which means that the government project officer will not maintain an employer-employee relationship with the administrative support personnel on-site. Therefore, vendors will be required to manage their employees who will be working at NIH facilities. 

Contractor supervisors will be utilized as much as possible during the administration of this contract and will be required to: conduct reviews (or other quality control procedures) with respect to the tasks and projects performed by their employees; address performance issues; gauge (or report on) any applicable performance measures; and conduct performance evaluations of the employees. In addition, contractor supervisors will be expected to engage in at least some of their supervisory tasks on site. 

Please provide an explanation of your firm's capability to provide the type of management infrastructure described above and comment on how communication may be delivered among the government, the contractor supervisors, and the administrative personnel. If your firm is not located near NIH facilities (see DRAFT SOW Section VII), please describe how your firm has managed geographically dispersed employees in previous contracts for similar services.

In addition, provide comments on your firm's capability to implement other elements of a successful management approach that include cost effectiveness, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of long term administrative support, and customer satisfaction. Finally, please describe how your firm has addressed any issues regarding personnel performance in the past. 

4.	Past Experience 

Vendors should state and describe their past experience with a project of the size, magnitude, and complexity in a scientific research or other technical environment as outlined in the DRAFT SOW. Please include the company's past (or current) experience description and its ability to acquire, maintain, and train qualified administrative support staff. 

5.	Contract Type/Performance Based Considerations 

NIH has not determined a contract type for this proposed procurement and is soliciting recommendations on the contract type(s) for the services in the DRAFT SOW based on past experience with similar requirements.

NIH is considering incorporating performance-based measures for these services. Please review the proposed performance measures in the DRAFT SOW and provide any comments/recommendations for the performance measures, standards, and acceptable quality levels (AQL).

6.	DRAFT SOW Comments/Questions 

The attached DRAFT SOW is a draft document and will be finalized with issuance of a solicitation. NIH is interested in your feedback on the attached DRAFT SOW. In addition to providing responses to the questions above, you are encouraged to also submit DRAFT SOW questions and comments. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, NIH will not be able to respond to questions and comments submitted. However, the questions and comments will be used to revise the DRAFT SOW in an effort to provide a value added final product. Additionally, a pre-solicitation conference may be held at a future, to be determined date.

For each DRAFT SOW question/comment submitted, the respondent should provide:

o	DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) section number;
o	Title of the DRAFT SOW section; and
o	Complete description of the question.

Example:  
DRAFT SOW Section II, entitled Scope of Contract
Comment: State comment, question, clarification. 

Responses to this sources sought are due at 3:00 p.m. EST on Monday, June 11, 2007, to the contract specialist, Mr. Zedekiah J. Worsham. Responses MUST be sent electronically to Mr. Worsham at Admin.Response@mail.nih.gov. Mailed, faxed, or hand-delivered responses will not be accepted. Emailed responses shall not be more than 50MB in size and will either be in Microsoft Word, PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel format. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR RESPONSE TO WORSHAMZ@OD.NIH.GOV.  Responses shall also include the Sources Sought Number in the Subject Line of the email. It is the responsibility of the vendor to contact the contract specialist to verify that its response was received. He can be reached at 301-594-3560. Information concerning this solicitation can also be located on the NIH Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations website, http://olao.od.nih.gov/VendorResources/AdminSupport/.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for 2 each SA 309913-01, ENC1000A94-00 Encoders (with Standard Features) to support the 419 FLTS to conduct flight testing.  This equipment must be completely compatible with the Enerdyne units that are already installed and in use in the bombers and other flight test aircraft at AFFTC.  This is a Brand Name or Equal acquisition. The following are the specifications:

?X	ADVS- Adaptive Digital Video Standard Compression Algorithm
?X	Real-Time Digital Compression of Full-Motion Video
?X	Small Size ?V 94 Cubic Inches
?X	Low Power ?V 8 Watts Typical at 28 VDC
?X	Three Selectable Video Inputs
?X	No Blurred Motion ?V Each Frame Separately Encoded
?X	User Programmable Video Parameters via EIA-232 Port
?X	Compsite NTSC Color and PAL, Y/C Capabilities
?X	Transmits at Rates Up to 10 Mbps Over Any Digital Medium

The ADVS Advanced Digital Video Standard compression technique causes no blurring of the compressed picture upon the encoding and decoding of any type of moving objects within a given picture.  A multiplexer provides inputs for asynchronous serial data, PCM data and clock, and an audio signal to be interspersed into the digitized video data stream.

The encoders will be used to compress the video signal received from the Merlin units in order to be able to record two hours using a HI-8mm tri-deck airborne video recorder.  Also, this signal may be transmitted to a ground station where the telemetry system will provide a real-time video picture of the pilot??s Head-Up-Display (HUD), the Multi-Function Display (MFD) and/or safety of flight test data during a mission.  Flight test engineers will be able to monitor aircraft performance in the control room as they observe an image of the pilot??s HUD and/or MFD.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of a Multi-Function Aiming Device.  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is attempting to improve the effectiveness of their soldiers by developing a fully integrated Multi-Function Aiming Device (MFAD) for engaging targets in close quarters combat.  

Combat operations require the soldier to accurately engage enemy personnel targets in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUNT) environments at ranges of 200 meters and closer.  These close quarter battle operations may require the soldier to clear buildings with multiple rooms over extended periods of time.  Reducing the weight of ancillary equipment (e.g. lasers, lights, pistol grips, etc.) and freeing up rail space on the front hand guard of the soldier?s weapon system in order to maintain a stable and solid firing position is critical to mission success.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue and free the weapon system of obstructions in order to accurately engage enemy personnel targets.  The MFAD shall incorporate the following components into a single, integrated system: a day sight, Infrared (IR) laser pointer, IR illuminator, visible laser pointer, and white light flashlight.

This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the MFAD.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 4Q FY07 or 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.    The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 10 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements from approximately 2,300 units to a total production potential of 10,000 units.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.

For raw produce and raw fish, names and addresses of all stores shall also be reported along with each sampling characteristic.  Aggregate data shall be reported two ways: (1) on the basis of unweighted store counts and (2) on the basis of annual all commodity store sales.  Examples of the two reporting bases are:  (1) "x% of stores have produce labeling" and (2) "Produce labeling appears in stores accounting for x% of annual all commodity store sales."  In addition to provision of store-level and aggregate data, the Contactor shall provide a narrative report as defined by FDA that describes survey results.  Offerors must demonstrate completeness of a sampling frame of retail stores; provision of evidence in support of a store list; in-depth knowledge of the location of national/regional/county retail stores; explanation of the sample design, including weighting procedures and expected precision of estimates (aggregate and cell-wise); in-depth knowledge of and past experience with types of retail stores and their level of sales; and the qualifications of the personnel and the organization based on knowledge and previous experience in selecting nationally representative samples of U.S. retail stores for food products.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for a multi-stage supersonic target development program.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is planned for release in first quarter FY-08.    

The United States Navy (USN) has an emergent requirement for a cost effective aerial target system to simulate a multi-stage anti-ship cruise missile threat.  The target vehicle will be required to exhibit a subsonic cruise stage, followed by a supersonic sprint stage. This target system will be used to support test and evaluation of ship platforms and associated self-defense systems currently being modified or in development.  In general terms, the vehicle should be capable of programmable navigation, including terminal weaves, have a range greater than 100 nautical miles, have a subsonic cruising range of greater than 90 nautical miles at 50ft Mean Sea Level (MSL), and attain a minimum sprint speed of 2.2 mach at 16ft MSL.

The USN anticipates the target program will enter System Development and Demonstration (SDD) in FY-08.  Accordingly, the Program Office (PMA-208) plans to conduct an Industry Day during fourth quarter FY-07.  The Program Office anticipates posting the Industry Day announcement by the end of June 2007 on FedBizOpps.  

This is not an RFP. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor will the U.S. Government pay for any information solicited or provided.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought
---------------
A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Safety IV Catheters.  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Safety IV Catheters that represents the clinically preferred product from a source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
 
     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program for their distribution of your products.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined on a best value basis.    
   
Point of Contact is Greg Morrison, 757-953-5804 or gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety IV Catheters. The approximate annual purchase volume of $331,000 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Safety IV Catheters over a one year period. 

 The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined on a ?best value? basis.

 The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, should email responses to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your company?s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your company?s responses to the questions under paragraph D.2, Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide the necessary technical criteria, ?no charge? samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your company?s base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  Failure to provide the information requested in the timeframes specified will result in your company being eliminated from further consideration.

Note: Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Vendors are advised that submission of information, samples and participation in clinical trials, etc., is done at no cost to the Government

For any subsequent mailing purposes, please use the following address: 

Gregory Morrison
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M (EST), seven (7) calendar days from the closing of this FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from future participation in this standardization effort.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil




D.	 Evaluation Criteria

Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria below.  A Clinical Product Team (CPT) will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  
For those companies meeting the criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to provide samples (at no cost to the government) to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be provided no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), two (2) weeks after the request is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to provide by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to ?not acceptable? and seven is equal to ?highly acceptable?. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Summary ratings for each vendor will be an average of their numerical scorings combined with an adjectival scale of ?highly acceptable?, ?acceptable?, ?minimally acceptable?, and ?not acceptable?.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. The scale descriptors are: 0 = ?not acceptable? and 7 = ?highly acceptable?.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will result in disqualification from further consideration in the standardization process. 
      
2.	 After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil.

Pricing offers must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) two (2) weeks from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). 

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the responses to the following technical criteria from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the vendor, who will be named the quoter, offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; 3) the quoter has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; 4) the quoter has an agreement covering the distribution of their products with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region.

<SUBJECT>A--Market Survey to identify potential sources to provide development across the family of Battle Command products
<SOLNBR>W15P7T07RN209
<RESPDATE>061608
<ARCHDATE>08152008
<CONTACT>allison.murray, 732-532-2205
<DESC>This is a Market Survey to identify potential interest for the Battle Command (BC) Development contractual effort described below. The effort is anticipated to be a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with five (5) one-year option periods. It will be a Cost Plus Award Fee and Time and Materials, multiple award contract to provide development across the family of Battle Command products.  The family of Battle Command products included in this development effort consist of: the Global Command and Control System Army (GCCS-A), the emerging Army contributions to the Network Enabled Command and Control System (NECC), Advanced Field Artillery Ta ctical Data Systems (AFATDS), Pocket Sized Forward Entry Device (PFED), Lightweight Forward Entry Device (LFED), Centaur, Gun Display Unit  Replacement (GDU-R)the Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3), Common Software (CS) services, elements of  support for the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) and Maneuver Control System (MCS), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDS), Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) and Theater Effects Based Operations (TEBO). The  systems under PM BCs control are undergoing change as a family of products to migrate to a net centric, service oriented architecture. The selected contractor will develop architecture providing for migration of key stovepipe functional capability to com mon services that can be consumed across the Battle Command and evolving joint enterprise (via initiatives like NECC and the FCS and DCGS families of systems). Currently there are activities within the Battle Command environment to define and implement SoS  oriented services that will provide a common framework and environment to support the transition. Efforts such as the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) development effort provide the initial starting point for migration to a service-oriented architect ure within the Battle Command family of systems. The selected contractor will be responsible for developing families of services across the Network Enabled Command and Control System (NECC), Future Combat System (FCS), Distributed Ground Station Army (DCGS -A) and commercial offerings to provide a host of additional services for the Battle Command family. In addition, the contractor shall leverage and provide service contributions as part of the service migration efforts. This effort will require integration  with available common services, leverage commercial technology offerings, and provide services to the enterprise environment, in addition to normal application development efforts for system specific functionality.  The Migration effort will be a phased, evolutionary effort to migrate from individual stovepipe systems to a service oriented environment where each system contributes to and consumes services across the enterprise and eventually integrates applications an d common toolsets to achieve commonality in look and feel for the user. In the interim period, PM BC needs to sustain the existing and evolving system baselines in the field. This acquisition effort supports those systems maintenance efforts as well. Each of the Battle Command systems has been developed over many years under the purview of different organizations with stovepipe requirements and different funding lines. For the most part, Product Managers had no unifying requirements in terms of develop ment environment, development processes, commercial toolsets and common display and management mechanisms across products. The synchronization of the eleven different product development efforts was difficult given the disperse requirements, separate organ izational structures and separate funding lines. Over the past several years focus has been placed on unifying the Battle Command family of systems via System of Systems initiatives that support network centric concepts outlined in the DoD Chief Informatio n Officers Net Centr ic data strategy. The tenets of the Net Centric approach were making data visible, available and usable; tagging data to enable discovery by users; posting data to shared spaces to provide open access; and migrating from point to point interoperability to many to many exchanges.  The major tasks that will make up this effort include the following for each of the Battle Command products: " Maintenance/Development of Battle Command Systems  " Development of Common and System Specific Services  " Integration of Common Service into Client Applications " Coordination with the SOS Engineering and Integration contractor-The SOSE&I contractor will develop direction for the development efforts. " Development of Design and Software Documentation " Testing (Unit and System) " Demonstration and experimentation support " Support of CTSF and NECC test environment Project Manager Battle Command will be soliciting for an IDIQ System of System Engineering & Integration (SoSEI) contract covering System of System (SoS) engineering, integration, test, logistics and field support. Any awardee of the Development contract s hall be excluded from award as prime or sub contractor on the SoSEI contract. This announcement is to establish an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for proposal preparation costs. Interested parties should provide an expression of their interest and any questions regarding the scope of the effort  to any of the Points of Contacts below:  Mr. Jim Cafiero, 732 532 4764, or james.cafiero@us.army.mil Ms. Barbara Girgus, 732 427-2947, or Barbara. girgus@us.army.mil Ms. Linda Johnston, 732 427-5956, or Linda.johnston@us.army.mil The deadline for response to this notice is 21 days from the date of publication.

<SUBJECT>R -- Annual Employee Survey
<DESC>This is  not a request for quotations.  The purpose of this announcement is to determine the number of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HubZone Businesses, or other Small Businesses who can furnish the service listed below.  
 
 The Bureau of Public Debt on behalf of  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor to conduct an annual employee satisfaction survey. 

The purpose of this award t is to fulfill the Board?s obligation under ?1128 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 which requires federal agencies to conduct an annual employee satisfaction survey and to  post the results of this survey on the Board?s website.

Objectives

The following are the objectives for this contract:

?	The contractor shall design and develop an employee satisfaction survey instrument which is consistent with the guidance which was issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on August 24, 2006, regarding the form and content of these employee satisfaction surveys. 

?	The contractor is expected to develop and deploy the survey instrument in an independent and secure online setting which will allow Access Board employees to answer survey questions openly and honestly.

?	The contractor must then analyze employee responses and produce a synthesis of these responses which will be suitable for posting on the Board?s website.

?	The contractor is also expected to provide all data and survey results to the Access Board for the Board?s own analysis and use. 

Tasks
On August 24, 2006, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published final regulations implementing the requirements of Section 1128 of the National Defense Authorization Act. These regulations set forth a series of forty-five (45) questions designed to assess employee satisfaction in a variety of areas including employee satisfaction with leadership policies and practices; the work environment; rewards and recognition for professional accomplishments; opportunity for professional growth and development; and opportunity to contribute to achieving the agency?s mission.  The Access Board is a small agency and, in order to maintain anonymity, the agency is requesting that an outside contractor develop and conduct this survey on our behalf.  Finally, we are asking the contractor to analyze the findings of these surveys and to produce a report for the agency.  The contractor shall conduct the following tasks:

?        Develop and test an online survey which is based on the OPM regulations which were published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2006.
?        Beta test the survey in a secure online environment so that the Board is sure that the all employee responses will be kept anonymous and confidential. 
?        Keep Access Board staff apprised of any new developments relating to the execution of this survey.
?        Two months after the contract is awarded the Board expects the OPM survey process to begin. The Board will supply the emails of staff and the contractor is expected to contact each staff member and encourage employee participation.
?        Approximately two months after this survey is administered, the contractor is expected to provide the Board with data resulting from the surveys, in electronic form, along with an analysis of these survey responses.
?        The contractor must assure that all surveys, electronic data gathered from these surveys, and any reports which are compiled for the Board as a result of this survey, comply with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

Responses to this announcement shall be sent to: Mary Crouser, Contract Specialist, Phone 304-480-8762 , Fax (304) 480-7204, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov by 2:00 p.m., Eastern time May 31, 2007.

The solicitation number for this request is  70181-7-R039 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-17) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

Key Date:  Proposal deadline is 11:59pm Alaska time (UTC -8) September 27, 2007 Overview Information Federal Agency Name:  Alaska Region, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Opportunity Title:  Sea Duck Joint Venture Program Announcement Type:  This is an annual request for proposals from the Sea Duck Joint Venture Full Text of Announcement I.  Funding Opportunity Description The Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of sea ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the SDJV, administers grants, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community's understanding of sea duck biology and ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties. The SDJV is receptive to funding annual projects as well as a limited number of multi-year (up to 3 years) projects.  Successful multi-year projects will be funded in 1-year increments, subject to annual review, demonstration of suitable progress, and funds availability.  After 3 years of consecutive funding, those projects may reapply and compete for SDJV funds in one-year increments only and they will be re-evaluated based on their continued merit.    Note:  Multi-year projects have special reporting requirements that must be addressed in both the proposal and in annual summary reports.   For example, in the proposal, submitters need to clearly define the results that will be attained annually and at the conclusion of the project (e.g., sample sizes, progress of analyses, reports and publications); in the annual summary report, the researcher must address their progress toward meeting annual and overall objectives.  Because multi-year projects commit SDJV funds for extended periods and thus limit the number of other projects which can be funded in subsequent years, they must ensure a good return on investment.  Projects with proven methodology and high likelihood of success will likely score higher than projects with untested methodology and high risk factors (unsecured funding, weather dependent, etc.). To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for SDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources. Examples of Recently Funded Projects: "	Spring Migration of Surf Scoters Along the Pacific Coast: Important Habitats and Energetic Implications "	Identification of Beaufort Sea Migration Corridor for Sea Ducks "	Breeding areas, migration routes, staging, molting, and local movements associated with both Surf and White-winged Scoters wintering in the inner marine waters of Washington State "	The Effect of Hunting and Avian Cholera on the St. Lawrence Estuary Common Eiders "	 Inorganic Contaminant Concentrations and Body Condition of Common Goldeneye Wintering on the Great Salt Lake, Utah "	Molt ecology of White-winged Scoters in the St. Lawrence estuary "	Temporal and Geographic Distribution of the Aleutian Islands Pacific Common Eider "	The value of herring spawn vs. alternative prey to Surf and White-winged Scoters in the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin "	Diet of Surf Scoters Molting in Eastern North America (see http://seaduckjv.org/fund/sdjvfundedstudies07.pdf for additional funded projects) II.	Award Information In 2007, SDJV received 23 proposals requesting a total of $400,000 and awarded about $260,000 to 15 projects.  The median level of funding was $15,000 (range $4,900 to $38,465).  Most projects funded by SDJV are one-year projects, although multi-year projects have been funded, and will be considered in this funding cycle as well.  Interest in the SDJV is growing rapidly and we anticipate an increase in the number of funding requests in FY08.  The SDJV encourages modest funding requests.  Previous award winners are eligible and previously funded projects are eligible to compete for supplemental funding with applications for new awards (see section I, above). Awards will be issued via contracts and purchase orders, based on a Service analysis of the nature of each selected project in light of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.3.  Acquisition instruments will be administered in accordance with FAR Parts 42 through 51, under the appropriate clauses of FAR Part 52, which will include a portion or all of the following clauses, dependant upon the total dollar threshold of the contract or purchase order selected for award: Each contract or purchase order awarded shall incorporate one or more of the following clauses, by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

Proposals with less than a 1:1 match will be considered, but will be ranked lower than comparable projects with a full match.  Additionally, proposals citing a match contribution which has its origin from other US Government Federal awards will be ranked less competitively than proposals citing a match funded through non-federal (i.e. not originally US Government in origin) funds.

<RESPDATE>052907
<ARCHDATE>06242007
<CONTACT>Ronald F. Konicek, Contracting Officer, 210-977-5483
<DESC>The AVE I1 element of the Crypto Modernization (CM) Program has identified the requirement for a software module to manage the DD Form 1423 Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) associated with the various contracts of the Program.   Management of the data includes scanning, data input, storage, modification, reproduction, automation, notification, tracking, reporting, and statuses of CDRLs, Data Item Descriptions, and Logistics, Engineering, and Security data submittals.  More specific functions would include: .An Integrated DID repository .Generation of CDRL 1423 forms  .Managing CLINS, Mods, and CDRL versions .Linking CDRL deliveries to contract milestones .Generating recurring CDRL delivery schedules .Forecasting CDRL receipts via calendar .Online CDRL submittal portals for vendors .Managing data separation security .Auto-route CDRL submittals for approval .Auto-alert reviewers via e-mail 25 User Licenses of the Software, Initial User Training, Installation, and Operational Services are required.  Licensing will be flexible enough for multiple users from different elements of the CM Program to make use of.  For example: AVE I1 and GOE I1 users could use the system simultaneously and when CDRL requirements draw down at the end of their contracts, Mission Data users could begin using the system.   Operational services would include: mapping and migrating our legacy data to the data base environment, tailoring data items (contracts, CDRLs, documents, action items, meetings, etc.) to presentation formats, developing data reports to our formats, building workflow template library for use in common review processes, developing specific business rules for automatic functions, and establishing program metrics and scorecards. The software program must address standardization, compatibility, maintainability, and interoperability issues associated with specific Network configuration requirements in which they will be deployed (Network Modular Automation 2000/XP).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL & OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME
FAR 6.302
TOS Purchase Request # 2007-31917


1.	Agency and Contracting Activity:   GSA/FAS/FEDSIM Acquisition 

2.	Nature/Description of Action:  

FEDSIM has a requirement to procure EMC2 network storage equipment/software for a client.

3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs:
Due to the formatting in FedBizOpps and clarity, the chart containing the equipment was removed from the justification.  The items and quantity are stated above in the Pricing Schedule 

4.	Identification of Justification Rationale:  

FAR 6.302-1 (c) Application for brand name descriptions. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

5.	Contractors Unique qualifications:

The contractor must be able to provide the Brand Name EMC2 storage in order to support current network standard implementation.  EMC2 storage is the standard for the client. FEDSIM?s client maintains support of the entire network infrastructure.  EMC storage is proprietary, and the client has approved EMC as part of their enterprise architecture. These configurations must be built as a whole, and are proprietary. FEDSIM?s client has a significant investment in terabytes of EMC storage, with over 3 million dollars of products currently in use.  Only the proprietary EMC storage equipment will properly interface with the existing client network infrastructure.  Based on this, FEDSIM has determined that EMC2 storage is the only Brand Name Products that meets the needs of our client.  

6. 		Description of solicitation.

This procurement will be accomplished on an open market basis utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures allowed for within FAR Part 12, ?Acquisition of Commercial Items?.  All items are not available on GSA Schedule. NASA SEWP IV does not prove any significant discounts from list pricing.  Market research has determined that an open market procurement would provide the Government a discount of about 50% from list pricing.  This acquisition will be publisized in FedBizOps as a brand name restriction, and will be limited to competition among the OEM and its distributors.

 7.	A Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  

After market research, FEDSIM has found that the manufacturer of EMC products may give a significant discount over list prices.  EMC has indicated that they would offer a special discount to the FEDSIM client, which is about 50% from their published list pricing. 

 8. 	Description of the Market Research conducted:  

The FEDSIM project manager performed searches on the internet, conducted product searches on GSA Schedule  SIN 132-8, NASA SEWP IV, reviewed published manufacturer list pricing, and additionally contacted the EMC manufacturer directly. 

 9. 	Additional Facts:  

This procurement is an add-on to the current network storage system. It is imperative that FEDSIM?s client only procures equipment that is compatible with the large current investment in EMC2 network storage in order to alleviate potential integration risks, higher costs (for additional hardware, software, other vendor service contracts for another server brand) and product performance problems.  Expedited delivery of 10 and 15 days will also be required.

10.	Listing of sources interested in the acquisition.

Research for this acquisition included review of both GSA Advantage and NASA SEWP online tools. Research of pricing and availability was done with EMC and EMC distributors including Unisys and Alpha Sum Business Machines.  In addition to these firms, any other authorized resellers of the required equipment may submit an offer.

11.	Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  

This procurement will be limited to OEM and dealer level competition, as only the manufacturer can provide the required products.  Given the proprietary nature of the items, no barriers can be removed.

12.	Certification:

?I certify that the data provided in support of this recommendation for other than full and open competition are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.?

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ELECTRIC CAR FEASIBILITY STUDY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Questions 1. Will a detailed inventory of the 1,300 GSA vehicles be made available at the beginning of the study? Desirable information includes description, age, use, utilization rate, (i.e., annual mileage), and condition.  Answer:  Once award has been made we will work with the contractor to provide all necessary vehicle data to assist them in this study. Some information may be limited by GSA policy. 2. Will a detailed description of the existing vehicle maintenance infrastructure (e.g., shop size, equipment, personnel, current training) be made available at the beginning of the study? Answer:  GSA vehicles are maintained by dealerships and vendors on the GSA list. All maintenance is accomplished off center, exception is local station provides minor repairs, oil changes, battery replacement and tires. 3. The vehicles are primarily used in the Launch Complex 39 area, Industrial area, and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). Do they also travel off-site (i.e., onto public roads)?  Answer:  Most vehicle operation is accomplished on center and between CCAFS. Some travel is accomplished off center, normally within a 60 mile radius. We do have some extended travel that requires vehicles to travel long distance and some vehicle support for travel (TDY) trips. Some day/overnight trips encompass travel of the complete state of Florida.  4. Will contractor personnel be provided with non-escort KSC badges for the period of the study effort?  Answer:  Badge (issued with the correct credentials) will be supplied to support the required efforts of the contractor. Foreign nationals will require escort while on KSC.  5. Should car environmental impact be evaluated end-to-end (i.e., including battery manufacture, etc) or only in service at KSC? Answer:  Environmental impact should be based on while in service at KSC, but should also address any environment concerns the vehicle would have upon excess.  6. Shall the presentation reports be delivered as personal briefings at KSC?  Answer:  Yes, final report should be accomplished as a presentation to KSC Center Operations Directorate. 7. Though fuel cell vehicles appear not to be cost effective at this time, does NASA wish the contractor to include analysis of these vehicles in its assessment of electric vehicle feasibility at the Kennedy Space Center?  Answer:  Our study is intended to be for battery electric vehicles, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are considered electric, but the fuel cell technology and hydrogen fuel infrastructure will not be available for 15 - 20 years. If the winning contractor would like to recommend this as a future study that would be fine. But the study is not intended for hydrogen vehicles. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 5/15/07. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions from potential bidders:
   QUESTION NUMBER 1: are their specific manufacturers that you would like for these 
   monitors? ANSWER NUMBER 1:  Sharp Aquos 57 inch monitor QUESTION NUMBER 2:  
   Will the units be used in a conference room or will the units be on all day? ANSWER 
   NUMBER 2: The units will be used in the Directors Conference Room to replace the White 
   Boards currently in use.  The monitors will only be on during Teleconference sessions and 
   therefore do not have to be special high volume use monitors.  Standard monitors will work fine 
   for this application. QUESTION NUMBER 3: The RFQ is asking for 57 inch LCD?s with internal 
   speakers. There are only consumer grade products available with internal speakers that 
   match the rest of the specs. Will a commercial grade monitor that has speakers that 
   attach to the side be accepted? The commercial grade are made to run 24hrs a day and 
   have a standard 3yr warranty. Also will you be purchasing more of these this year  
   ANSWER NUMBER 3: We have a size limitation with regard to the area where the monitors 
   are to be installed, so the Sharp Aquos is the choice to fit into that location.  A consumer grade 
   product is not what we are looking for.  Commercial grade monitors would be overkill in this 
   project. We may be looking for 2 more of these this year but most likely no more than that.
