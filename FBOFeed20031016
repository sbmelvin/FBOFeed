<DESC>Ultra-Low Temperature, Ultra-High Vacuum, Superconductor Magnet System for a Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Measurement System GovWorks is issuing a Request for Proposal on behalf of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),  Electron Physics Group who has a requirement for the design, construction, and installation of an Ultra-Low Temperature (ULT), Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV), Superconductor Magnet System for a new scanning tunneling microscopy measurement system that will be located in NIST?s new Advanced Measurement Laboratory currently under construction.   Measurements will be made at very low temperatures down to 10 mK (millikelvin) and in high magnetic fields up to 15 T.   The measurement space for the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) must be ultra-high vacuum, obtainable at room temperature.  This type of measurement system must contain a UHV compatible Joule-Thomson type dilution refrigerator to obtain temperatures in the millikelvin range and provide a UHV space for the STM, and a superconducting magnet system to generate high magnetic fields up to 15 T.  All materials and components inside the vacuum space of the dilution refrigerator must be UHV compatible.  The He3 condensation stage must be a Joule-Thomson heat exchanger in place of the typical 1 K pot. The scanning tunneling microscope, which NIST will build, will be mounted on a platform connected to the dilution refrigerator in the inner vacuum can of the dilution refrigerator.  The dilution refrigerator will have a central axis tube to allow samples and probe tips to be transferred to the STM in UHV.  The dilution refrigerator and magnet system will be contained in a super-insulated He vapor shielded He dewar.   The design of the system must emphasize low noise and vibration free operation suitable for scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.  A complete turn-key system with safety interlocks must be supplied to operate the entire dilution refrigerator, superconducting magnet, and He cryostat system.   ***The period of performance will be 18 months from the date of award.

<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is establishing a new program that focuses on the rapid technology transition of revolutionary sensing capability  to support combat identification.  Based upon a government study, there appears  to be much contributing research within the Air Force, Department of Defense,  National Labs and industry that would support the development of a long-range,  unambiguous sensing capability from airborne and ground platforms.  ASC is  working with Air Combat Command (ACC) to develop operational concepts for this  envisioned capability and to plan for the potential acquisition to field this  capability.  All interested parties are invited to submit all relevant efforts  in laser sensing and multi-discriminant identification and any concepts for the  rapid development of multi-discriminant, unambiguous identification at long  ranges. Submissions should address all work/experience in the areas of laser  imaging (1D, 2D, and 3D), multipixel vibrometry, multispectral imaging,  multispectral polarimetry, multipixel moving target indication, precision  geolocation, texture mapping, change detection, and differential absorption  LADAR (DIAL).  Since atmospheric effects and target phenomenology play a large  role in the success of this capability, please include information pertaining  to work/experience in these areas as well.  Responses should address and  summarize the contractor’s research in these areas, testing of technology and  products, the level of maturity of your technology and products, and any  applications of technology to specific solutions and products. Responses will be considered an initial step in establishing industry interest  and understanding of the AMDS program and will allow the government team to  determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the  program. This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to  award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Submitting responses to this RFI is  voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.   Submissions should be made using a CD-R in an electronic format that is  compatible with Microsoft Windows and Office 97.  Submit two copies via  overnight mail to Maj Mark Fahrenkamp at the address set forth  above.  If the CD contains proprietary/competition sensitive information, the  CD and cover label should be marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive  Information."  Also, two paper copies of the response should be submitted  unbound in three-ring binders and must be clearly  labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on the cover sheets and  in close proximity to this type of information on each applicable page.  Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from  disclosure.   The paper copies and the electronic versions must be identical in all  respects.  Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches.  Pages shall be single-spaced.   The font size shall be no less than 12 point.  Use at least 1-inch margins.   For page counting purposes, double-sided pages shall be treated as two pages.   Contractor paper copy submittals shall not exceed 4 pages in length. No classified information should be included in contractor submittals.   Submissions shall be due no later 4:30 pm on 6 November 2003.

<RESPDATE>112403
<ARCHDATE>01232004
<CONTACT>Mary Byrd, 703-325-1714
<DESC>NA ELECTRONIC TRIP FLARE (ETF)  The purpose of this announcement is to request comments from industry on the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) technical requirements and acquisition strategy for the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s pending Electronic Trip Flare (ETF) acquisition.  The ETF will be a simple, c ompact, modular, sensor-based warning system with programmable responses that can be used either as a tactical stand-alone system or as a supplemental device used with other security systems or missions.  The ETF procurement will be managed by the materiel  developer, the Office of the Product Manager, Physical Security Equipment (PM-PSE), at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The US Army Military Police School (USAMPS) is the combat developer.  The ETF system will be capable of detecting intruders using remotely located mo tion sensor modules (MSM), which subsequently control preprogrammed responses ranging from visible illumination (continuous or strobe), infrared (IR) illumination, audible alarm, or a combination of any or all of the above.  The ETF must have the capabilit y of accurately sending alarm information to the Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS) hand-held monitor, and it should be capable of being effectively integrated into planned and future Battle Command Systems including, but not limited to, the Remotely  Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (REMBASS), the Improved Remotely Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (IREMBASS), and the Tactical Remote Security System (TRSS).   The primary objective of ETF system is to detect the motion of an intruder (individual and/or vehicular).  Secondary objectives for the command and control of preprogrammed responses to intruder detection include control of the light modules (LM), generati on and forwarding of alarm signals to the remote control module (RCM), generation of local audio alarms, and communications with the RCM for the purpose of monitoring system activity, displaying/annunciating alarm indications, and controlling system respon se to intruder detection.  ETF will satisfy an immediate Army requirement for early detection, warning, and reporting of intrusions into areas of responsibility, with the added requirement of providing programmable responses of illumination and sound, to e nhance force effectiveness and increase situational awareness and operational reaction time during all types of combat operations.  In addition to the Army, functional users of ETF are anticipated to be front-line, combat and combat support activities of t he U.S. Air Force and the U.S Marine Corps, as well as Department of Defense (DoD) security and law enforcement units.  To date, ETF has undergone Concept and Technology Development, which has resulted in development of brassboard models.  The System Desig n Development (SDD), Low Rate Initial and Full Rate Production (LRIP, FRP) phases of ETF are the subjects of this DRFP.  The SDD portion of the resulting contract will be Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF).  The LRIP and FRP portions of the contract will be Fixed Price Incentive (FPI).  The successful contractor will be selected on the basis of the proposal that offers the best value to the Government, trade-offs considered.  Evaluation factors will include Technical, Supportability, Cost, Performance Risk, and Man agement (weighted value not necessarily in this order).  In order to minimize development and production risks and avoid costly delays, the Government anticipates a six-year SDD/LRIP/FRP effort broken out as follows: (1) Design, fabricate, integrate, test (PQT 1a/b and PQT 2), deliver and support (during an Early User Appraisal Ã¢Â€Â“ EUA Ã¢Â€Â“ and Logistics Demonstration Ã¢Â€Â“LD) 40 ETF prototypes to include drafting operator/maintainer manuals, commercial and engineering drawings and associated lists, a nd operator/maintainer training within 18 months of contract award;   (2) Produce, test (PVT 1a/b and PVT 2), deliver and support (during Operational TestingÃ¢Â€Â”OT) 150 ETF LRIP systems, to include operator/mai ntainer manuals, development and update of production item detail specifications, and conduct of operator/maintainer training, at the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s option, during a follow-on 12 month period;  (3) Produce, test (PAT 1a/b and PAT 2), deliver and support an estimated 28,847 FRP systems, to include operator/maintainer manuals, commercial and engineering drawings and associated lists, and operator/maintainer training, at the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s option , during three follow-on one-year periods;  (4) Warrant LRIP and FRP ETF components for a period of two years following acceptance; and (5) Provide renewable one-year Life Cycle Contractor Support (LCCS) at the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s option. In preparation for the release of the ETF Request for Proposal (RFP), the Government is seeking comments from industry on the acquisition strategy discussed in this announcement and the DRFP, which will be posted to the CECOM Acquisition Center (CAC) Inter active Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) on or about 24 October 2003.  Responses must be received no later than 12:00pm (EDT) on 24 November 2003 or 30 days from posting date, whichever is later.  These documents will be posted on the CAC IBOP at Ã¢Â€Âœhttp://abop.monmouth.army.mil/Ã¢Â€Â on or about 24 October 2003.  These documents are downloadable.  This DRFP will be identified on the IBOP as Ã¢Â€ÂœETF, DAAB15-04-R-0001, Pre-SolicitationÃ¢Â€Â. Comments in response to this DRFP must be submitted to Jeanie Kampschroeder at Jean.Kampschroeder@cacw.army.mil.  Ms. Kampschroeder may be reached by phone at 703-325-6173 or fax at 703-325-4995.   At this time, no Pre-Solicitation Conference or Pre-Proposal Conference is anticipated.   See Notes 9 and 26.

<DESC>Market Research - The Air Force Systems Network (AFSN) program was tasked by HQ Air Force to conduct a study on the effects of Bandwidth Optimization technology and the possible benefit for reducing the cost of long-haul communications circuits. AFSN, in turn, has decided to conduct an in-depth market study and compile the results into a report that will be presented to the Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA). This study will be accomplished by performing product evaluations and preparing a report. The report will address varied vendors products and how they functioned for requirements given. The report may also be used by various AF activities such as Air Force System Network (AFSN) office, the CITS Program Office, MAJCOM SCs, and others, to assist them in deciding upon their possible implementation of a Bandwidth Optimization product or suite of equipment.  All products, or family of products, must meet the following list of requirements to be considered in the study. These listed characteristics/functions were seen as the agency’s minimum requirements for the management, reporting, and overall optimization of bandwidth between the WAN and an AF base:  Data compression and reduction in total number of packets across the WAN; Quality of Service (QoS) – packet marking, queuing, congestion avoidance, rate limiting, and traffic shaping - to the IP address level; Traffic Analysis - most active senders/receivers, protocol usage, top websites accessed, etc. on both compressed and uncompressed data flows; Hierarchical Management - NOSC, NCC, AFNOC, and AFNOSC access to reports, functions, etc.; Central Reporting - provide reports that can be used to analyze traffic trends on the WAN and could also be used to produce financial accounting reports; Support a fully meshed network of at least 140 locations and provide throughput up to 45 Mbps of compressed data; Hardware must be rack mountable in a standard 19” rack and use 110-130 VAC, 50-60 Hz.  Each vendor must provide an end-to-end solution that meets the stated requirements. Vendors are invited to identify products or families of products for evaluation.  Vendors should provide a proposed list of equipment, model numbers, and necessary quantities for testing. Vendors should provide documentation on the features supported and GSA (or other Government contract discounted) prices for their family of products. A Product Evaluation Agreement covering a 120 day evaluation period must be executed prior to submitting any products for testing. Vendor product recommendations and Product Evaluation Agreements should be submitted to the AFSN PMO within 5 work days following the date of the GPE advertisement.   AFSN will evaluate the submitted products/documents and notify vendors whose products met the requirements. Following notification by the AFSN Program Office, interested vendors must send equipment to AFSN within 10 business days, with return RMA information for return shipment following evaluation.  Applicable technical manuals, quick start guides, and other vendor documentation normally provided to a customer should accompany the products.  Additionally, engineering support should be made available as required for the duration of the evaluation. AFSN will evaluate the suite of equipment that met the stated requirement, and apply those results to the entire family.  The evaluation will be completed by 01 December 2003.  In the event an extension of the evaluation period is required by AFSN, the Government will coordinate and obtain approval from the vendor. Product evaluation will be conducted by the Air Force Systems Networking Program Management Office (AFSN PMO), HQ SSG/XON, 501 East Moore Drive, Bldg 884, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114. Questions or comments in response to this approach should be submitted within 5 business days of posting of this notice on the Government Wide Point of Entry (GPE). Please submit questions or comments to Ms. Wanda Dixon, Contracting Officer, email address: wanda.dixon@gunter.af.mil or Mr. Kevin Hamilton, Program Manager, email address: kevin.hamilton@gunter.af.mil Mailing Address: HQ SSG/XON, 501 East Moore Drive, Bldg 884, Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, AL 36114.  This is not a solicitation. This is market research only.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with providing information and associated evaluation products and support in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>The Unconventional Innovations Program (UIP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking revolutionary technologies for cancer research.  The UIP is soliciting proposals for the development of multifunctional technology platforms to support minimally intrusive approaches that integrate: a) sensing of the fundamental signatures of precancers, or early, metastatic, or recurring cancers in the living body, b) transmission of signature information to an external monitor, c) controlled, specific, treatment, d) monitoring of the effects of treatment.  The UIP particularly seeks technology platforms that integrate novel approaches to signature recognition, signal generation, signal amplification, signal transmission, intervention delivery, intervention feedback, and data interpretation.  Proposals are encouraged from investigators from a variety of disciplines including, but not limited to, biomedical research, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computational sciences; particularly as multidisciplinary teams.  The detailed Broad Agency Announcement is available on the web site of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI at :  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/appl/rfp/published_rfps.jsp with instructions for submission of proposal and evaluation criteria.  Investigators are encouraged to visit the UIP websites;  http://otir.cancer.gov/tech/uip.html  for a program overview, and http://otir.cancer.gov/tech/uip_awards.html  for abstracts of currently funded UIP contractors.

<DESC>The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, is seeking one contractor to provide two identical Beam Transfer Optics Diagnostic Sensors (BTODS): one for the Gemini North Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics system and one for the Gemini South Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics system. Each BTODS consists of a pair of digital cameras (Near Field and Far Field sensors), readout electronics and computer hardware and software (also designed by vendor) to measure and compute the alignment and beam quality of one to five laser beams as they propagate through the Beam Transfer Optics system. The sensors will also be used to image stars to determine initial alignment references. The controllers will have to interface with the Beam Transfer Optics Control System to allow slow reliable closed loop operations to maintain alignment during laser observations. The sensors have been selected (Cooke Corporation PixelFly QE cameras) and will be purchased by the vendor.  The full requirements for this procurement, and instructions for submitting a proposal, will be given in a Request for Proposal to be released in the near future.  Firms that are interested in receiving this Request for Proposal should fax (520-318-8590) or email (aflach@gemini.edu) a letter of interest addressed to Andrew Flach, Gemini Contracts Manager by no later than 31 October 2004.  This letter of interest should reference RFP N231224 and give the name, address, phone number, and fax number of a contact person at your firm.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source modification to contract N00019-02-C-3059 with Harris Corporation, Government Communications Systems Division, P.O. Box 37, Melbourne, FL  32902-0037.  This modification will task the contractor to perform efforts toward production Lot 5 obsolescence redesign of Tactical Aircraft Moving MAp Capability (TAMMAC) components, which includes the Army DM-200 Digital Map System (DMS), Navy DMS and DVMC with Extension Housing. The redesign is necessary due to the obsolescence of certain key components in the systems that are no longer available.  Harris Corporation is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the TAMMAC DMC, and is, therefore, the only known firm with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment and experience to fulfill this requirement.  See Note 22.

8. Information on proprietary information and data rights (to include source code).

9. Describe the methodology to safeguard the Driver Trainer's Information system (IS) integrity and outline the process to gain an "approval to operate" (ATO) in compliance with DoDI 8500.1 IA and DoDI 5200.4 DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP).  This approval is required prior to fielding, operating the system in an exercise, or connecting to other ISs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The SASS must be a direct line of sight system capable of engaging primarily personnel targets out to 800 meters (1,000 meters desired) and be a rugged and highly reliable system that minimizes both muzzle flash and blast signatures during firing.  The SASS operational weight, complete with suppressor, day optical scope and magazine (unloaded)should be less than 16 pounds.  It should have durable, anti-corrosion finishes or be constructed from corrosion resistant materials or be constructed from materials which resist exposure to solvents and cleaners.  All external/exposed surfaces should be dull and non-reflective.   The objective external color is tan, gray-green, gray or taupe.  The SASS should include a maintenance/cleaning kit containing all operator level repair parts and tools.  Operators and maintenance manuals will also be required.  Components requirements are as follows:  The rifle must be highly accurate when firing the M118LR (primary cartridge) and M993 Armor Piecing ammunition and be compatible with military standard 7.62x51mm.  It should have an adjustable trigger pull (desired); have a detachable box magazine with a minimum capacity of 5 rounds and maximum 20 round capacity; have an easy to operate and positive safety; and have no parts which can be improperly assembled to the detriment of weapon performance.   The rifle should also have a minimum barrel life of 5,000 rounds and be easily disassembled into components.  The maximum length of the system should not exceed 48 inches and should come equipped with a sling and bipod.  The optical sighting system must provide suitable resolution to allow target identification at the maximum effective range of the system; provide a threaded interface to accept LASER protection; be detachable; and interface with a Picatinny type rail IAW MIL-STD-1913.  The optical sighting system should have a scaled reticle to aid in range estimation; repeat zero within 1/2 MOA when removed and then reinstalled on the weapon; have adjustable windage and elevation controls; provide sufficient adjustment to compensate for the ballistic drop of the M118LR out to the maximum effective range of the system; remain watertight when submerged in water; come equipped with dust covers; be provided with a hardened carrying case for protection during airborne operations.  The component carrying case should be capable of storing all system components and protect system components during hot, cold, rain conditions, transportation and storage.  An objective requirement is to provide protection to the system during parachute airdrop and subsurface deployment (33 ft threshold, 66 ft objective).  A drag bag soft case is also required for man pack infiltration of the system.  If your firm has either an existing or developmental item which meets the specified requirements please provide brochures or other information relative to performance of your product.  This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice.  There is no formal solicitation available at this time. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  See Note 25.

Additionally, M993 Armor Piercing (AP) ammunition will be fired based on specific mission requirements.  Compatibility with the existing family of military 7.62x51mm caliber ammunition is also required. . The primary components of the system include a rifle, detachable bipod, hard transport/storage case(s), soft carrying case(s), cleaning/maintenance equipment, and manuals.  The weapon will have a flash/sound suppressor, high capacity (up to 20-round) detachable box magazines; rails/mounting surfaces for mounting fire control (optics, backup iron sights and aim- light) systems; variable power optics/electro-optics (in order to engage targets between 50 and  1000 meters); and an accompanying spotting scope with range estimation reticle(s) and a night vision interface.  The potential contractor must be able to produce a minimum of 80 systems per month with a production surge capability to 120 systems per month.   . Spare parts and logistic support packages will also be required.  The potential contractor will also be required to supply depot level maintenance support based within the Continental U.S. (CONUS).  . The SASS must be a direct line of sight system capable of engaging primarily personnel targets out to 800 meters (1,000 meters desired) and be a rugged and highly reliable system that minimizes both muzzle flash and blast signatures during firing.  The SASS operational weight, complete with suppressor, day optical scope and magazine (unloaded)should be less than 16 pounds.  It should have durable, anti-corrosion finishes or be constructed from corrosion resistant materials or be constructed from materials which resist exposure to solvents and cleaners.   .

The maximum length of the system should not exceed 48 inches and should come equipped with a sling and bipod.   . The optical sighting system must provide suitable resolution to allow target identification at the maximum effective range of the system; provide a threaded interface to accept LASER protection; be detachable; and interface with a Picatinny type rail IAW MIL-STD-1913.  The optical sighting system should have a scaled reticle to aid in range estimation; repeat zero within 1/2 MOA when removed and then reinstalled on the weapon; have adjustable windage and elevation controls; provide sufficient adjustment to compensate for the ballistic drop of the M118LR out to the maximum effective range of the system; remain watertight when submerged in water; come equipped with dust covers; be provided with a hardened carrying case for protection during airborne operations.   . The component carrying case should be capable of storing all system components and protect system components during hot, cold, rain conditions, transportation and storage.  An objective requirement is to provide protection to the system during parachute airdrop and subsurface deployment (33 ft threshold, 66 ft objective).  A drag bag soft case is also required for man pack infiltration of the system.  . If your firm has either an existing or developmental item which meets the specified requirements please provide brochures or other information relative to performance of your product.   . This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice.  There is no formal solicitation available at this time. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  . No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  . All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. . The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. . See Note 25.
