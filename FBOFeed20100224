<CONTACT>Cheryl D Allen, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-606-2054 , Fax 202-606-1464, Email Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov
<DESC>The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a presolicitation notice for this requirement on May 5, 2009 under Solicitation Number OPM049-09-R-0005.  We cancelled that presolicitation notice on June 15, 2009.  We are issuing this presolicitation notice under Solicitation Number OPM049-10-R-0001.

As the Federal governments human resources agency, OPM administers insurance and retirement benefits for millions of Federal and United States Postal Service employees and annuitants and their eligible family members.  As part of its mission to manage insurance benefits, OPM oversees BENEFEDS, an enrollment web site and customer service call center that currently performs enrollment and premium administration for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) and payroll allotment for the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS).

OPM has an ultimate vision for a one-stop shop for the administration of enrollment in our benefits programs.  In this proposed procurement, we have short-term and long-term goals.  We first intend to contract for current BENEFEDS functionality and some enhanced services.  These include:

	FEDVIP Enrollment and Premium Administration 
	FSAFEDS Allotment Administration 
	basic decision support tools 
	customer service/call center services
	MyBENEFEDS  expanded online account information and history

Our plan is then to expand BENEFEDS over the next several years to include:

	FSAFEDS enrollment 
	Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) premium administration
	a robust suite of decision support tools that will provide eligible individuals with assistance in making benefits decisions. 

Our long-term goal is to expand BENEFEDS to include enrollment, reconciliation, and premium administration for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) and Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) programs.  We wish to explore with the successful offeror the feasibility and steps necessary to accomplish this goal through requirements gathering and prototype development. However, we do not envision actually moving FEHB and FEGLI functions to BENEFEDS during the proposed contract.

The performance period for the proposed contract is expected to be ten years:  a five-year base period plus five one-year options.

OPM intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) on or about March 12, 2010.  The RFP and all documents relating to this requirement will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site at https://www.fbo.gov.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FBO web site for release of the RFP and all other documents relating to this requirement.  We encourage offerors to register on the FBO web site for email notification of all actions relating to the RFP and for the interested vendors list.  After we release the RFP, we will give offerors the opportunity to ask questions.  We will include all questions and answers in an amendment to the RFP and post the amendment on the FBO web site.

Because of the unique constraints and circumstances associated with the development and maintenance of the BENEFEDS web site, OPM plans to hold a preproposal conference on March 25, 2010 at our headquarters office located at 1900 E Street NW, Alan K. Campbell Auditorium (Ground Floor), Washington, D.C. 20415 from 9:00 AM until 12:30 P.M.  During the preproposal conference, we will provide an overview of the RFP; demonstrate the current web sites capabilities; and answer questions.  After we release the RFP, we strongly encourage offerors to submit questions prior to the preproposal conference.

We encourage offerors to attend the preproposal conference.  Attending the preproposal conference will help you learn more about our requirement and prepare a stronger proposal in response to the RFP.  If you plan to attend the preproposal conference, you must email Cheryl D. Allen, Contracting Officer,  at Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov by March 18, 2010 and include the following registration information:  (1) Your company name; (2) Single company point of contact (first and last name, title, telephone number, fax number , email address, and mailing address); (3) Your company web site; (4) List of attendees (total number of your company employees expected to attend the preproposal conference, first and last names, titles, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses); (5) Your business classification code; and (6) One-page executive summary of your company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in Microsoft Word format or PDF format.

Proposals will be due on or about May 6, 2010.  The proposed acquisition will be unrestricted and we will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal.

We anticipate awarding the proposed contract by September 2010.

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to assess industry capability to provide the below described functionalities and services in a COTS, ready to implement solution; solicit capability statements from industry, including small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible 8(a) certified firms; and determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible 8(a) certified firms.
The FAA has identified a requirement for additional data relevant to General Aviation (GA) Aircraft Operations for study and potential incorporation into the ADAPT System for a period of one year from the date of contract award.  This data will be acquired, studied, and potentially incorporated into ADAPT on a trial basis.
In publishing this Market Survey, the FAA assumes no liability or obligation to continue any solution offered by any prospective vendor beyond a one year (365 calendar days) trial period.  It is the FAA's intent to leverage, to the greatest extent possible, the existing ADAPT infrastructure in conducting this trial.  The following have been identified as critical requirements of any proposed solution.  These critical requirements are not intended as all-inclusive nor listed in order of importance:
1.	Real-time monitoring of GA aircraft flight tracks for all aircraft by registration (tail) number in both Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) environments;2.	Historical display of previous flight activity for a period not to exceed 24 months by registration (tail) number, regardless of flight plan filing methodology (information should include date, time, call sign/registration number, origin/destination, aircraft type, and owner/operator/fractional information);3.	Immediate flight track replay, to include flight track, owner/operator information - suitable for access via both the standard ADAPT and on Web ADAPT systems;4.	Detection of callsign to registration number change over time (potential indicator of suspicious activity);5.	Display of potential fuel on board at departure by aircraft type;6.	Display projected aircraft path based on departure fuel on board as well as remaining;7.	Positively identify aircraft by tail number from as many IFR and/or VFR flights as possible, regardless of the callsign;8.	Provide detailed ownership / operator information to include aviation contacts for private, corporate, executive, charter, and fractional ownership operations.
In addition to the above requirements, vendors responding to this survey must furnish a summary of their plan to provide the following services:
1.	Installation - The Contractor must perform all set up functions necessary to permit subscriber access to all data within the scope of any licensing agreement;2.	Training - The Contractor must provide, for each subscriber, the training necessary to enable that subscriber to access, interpret, manipulate, share, protect, and save the data within the scope of any licensing agreement.  This training may be either in-person, computer-based, or a combination of both; and 3.	Maintenance - The Contractor must provide 24 hours per day, seven days per week customer service.
Vendors who believe they possess the ability to meet these requirements are requested to submit a summary of capabilities not to exceed 25 pages in length.  The summary of capabilities must address how the vendor has gained the ability to meet each of the eight (8) technical requirements previous listed and the three (3) service requirements noted above. 
The FAA will not use the capability statements received in response to this market survey to screen or down-select interested industry participants. Rather, they will be used to determine the range of vendors, capabilities, and experience. The Government may invite respondents for follow-up discussions. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFERS, NOR IS IT THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO USE THIS AS A SCREENING DEVICE FOR ANY SUCH FUTURE REQUESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY COSTS RELATED TO RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 
The North American Industry classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 518210.
Vendor capability statements, including a completed Business Declaration form, should be submitted to the following address. Electronic replies are preferred.

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB) plans to procure the brand name or equal Sorvall MTX-150 Benchtop micro-ultracentrifuge and S120-AT3 Fixed Angle Titanium Rotor, 14 x 0.5ml.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB) studies the molecular basis of cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The focus of the lab is to understand the molecular basis for the catalytic activity, regulation and cellular function of the Arf GAPs with the ultimate goal of developing therapeutics targeting specific Arf GAPs. In current work, the LCMB found that (1) the interaction of Arf GAPs with membrane surfaces is critical to their function (2) the Arf GAPs function in protein complexes on membrane surfaces and (3) each Arf GAP has distinctive structural requirements for catalytic activity and regulation. 

The ultracentrifuge is necessary for studying the interaction with membrane surfaces, including large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and purified Golgi apparati, in small volume assays. It is also necessary for the preparation of LUVs used in many assays including assays of protein-protein interaction for those associations that depend on a surface.

The Sorvall MTX 150 Micro-Ultracentrifuge are engineered to deliver performance and versatility.  The MTX 150 is the smallest unit in its class yet achieves the highest speeds (150,000 rpm) and the highest g-force (1,048,000 x g) with rotor capacities of up to 180ml.  Quiet operations (<48 dBA) and standard electrical outlet capabilities have the added convenience of being able to place the unit anywhere in the lab.

The salient characteristics for the required benchtop micro-ultracentrifuge are as follows: 

1)  A footprint of no more than 2.3 square ft. 

2.)  The top speed of 150,000rpm. 

3.) The unit operate at 48dBA which makes it comfortable to quietly run in the lab. 

4.) Rotors that can spin 6 X 30ml volumes and a swinging bucket that holds 4 X 7ml volumes. 

Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov or fax (301) 402-4513.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed to the aforementioned individual.  Estimated date of the solicitation is March 15, 2010.

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have a valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Reference: RFQ-NCI-100051-TG.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order on a noncompetitive (sole source) basis to Accelrys, 10188 Telesis Court, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121 to purchase DiscoveryStudio software license for the period of (1) one year.

THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN PROCUREMENT.  The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract  based upon a two-phase selection procedure.  The project solicitation consists of two (2) phases.  This Pre-solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process.  To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220 and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 million.  This project is available to all responsible Design-Build contractors nationwide meeting the above-referenced NAICS code under full and open competition.
The Scope of Work (SOW) includes a design/build project to rehabilitate an existing 6000 square foot building for a visitor center and construct a new 1000 square foot restroom structure.  The project also includes a new 50-car parking area, entry plaza, paths and related site work.  The new facility will be a showcase for sustainable design and construction.  Features include a 70kw photo voltaic system, a ground and water source heat pump system, a wetlands-based sewage treatment system, an incandescent-free lighting system, and numerous other green building features.  It will achieve a LEED Platinum rating and function as a net-zero energy use facility by producing all of the annual energy needs onsite via the use of renewable energy sources, thus having a zero carbon footprint for facility operation.
The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design (SD) drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two).  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions may be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  The project process will follow National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ).
The estimated price is between $ 5,000,000.00 and $7,000,000.00, including all design and construction services.  The contract provides for preparation of Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CDs).  ARRA funding has been secured for this project.
For Phase One, all Design-Build (D-B) firms that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit qualifications until 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), March 17, 2010.  Qualifications will be evaluated based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance:

1.  Demonstrate experience in designing and constructing similar facilities (visitor centers, museums, or welcome centers)
2. Past Performance
	a.  Demonstrate past performance on  design/build projects, especially experience that the offeror's current A-E/construction company partnership has working together.  Include any examples that demonstrate proven performance in meeting tight project schedules.  
	b. Demonstrate past performance in providing innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost; 

3. Demonstrate experience in completing LEED-certified projects.  Demonstrate an understanding of how to create a "net-zero" energy use facility.
4. Demonstrate experience with specialized sustainable technology installations, including photo-voltaic systems, ground and water loop heat pump systems, extensive day-lighting treatments, ultra low energy-use equipment, and on-site wetland based sewage treatment systems.
5. Demonstrate experience and ability to use project management tools and techniques such as MS-Project, resource-loaded scheduling, fast-track scheduling, Critical Path Method and earned value analysis.
Design-Build (D-B) firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit qualifications to the office indicated below for Phase One evaluation.  
The Brooks Act does not apply to this procurement as the acquisition is NOT for Architect-Engineer Services.  However, a Standard Form (SF) 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications may be used to submit qualifications, but is not required.  The SF 330's are formatted for Architect-Engineer (A-E) and related services, but this form can be used for both design and construction qualifications.  The SF 330 can be downloaded from the forms library section at following website:  http://www.gsa.gov.  Firms responding to this announcement using their own format should make certain all required information is included in their submittal.
Firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit Two (2) hard copies of its response.  Only hard copy responses received by 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), March 17, 2010, will be evaluated further.  Up to Four (4) of the most highly-qualified Design-Build (D-B) firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this Design-Build selection process.
In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent the Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the NPS Schematic Design Drawings, project requirements narrative, Performance Technical Specifications (PTS), and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.  Offerors will be asked to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposal.  The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal.  A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals for Phase Two.  Large business contractors will be expected to submit a sub-contracting plan and subcontract at least 19.5% of the award total to small businesses.
Short-listed offerors will be asked to submit both a technical and price proposal based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP.  Award of a single contract will be made to the "Best Value" offeror by approximately June 15, 2010.  Debriefings will be made available after contract award.

The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design:  1) addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies, 2) safely and effectively meets the stated objectives, 3) addresses unique site conditions, 4) Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures, and 5) Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Stratus Consulting, Inc for their continued support with the Southeast Adaptation Project.
A workshop was held in Atlanta, where over 200 participants representing, federal, state, and local government, nonprofits, universities, and the private sector were in attendance.  Based upon the success of the workshop, background papers, and input from participants, USEPA intends to modify the existing purchase order to ensure continued success of the workshop.  Stratus Consulting is the vendor of choice for several reasons.  This modification to the purchase order is a one-time limited expansion of Task 5:  Final Report of the project to more fully build upon and leverage the results of Tasks 1 through 4.  Were another vendor to take over, a significant loss of continuity and progress would occur.  A loss of the institutional knowledge from Stratus Consulting, whom executed Tasks 1 through 4 and a portion of Task 5 of the project would also occur.  The final report, not to mention the bulk of the project would inevitably suffer; therefore, this additional work should be awarded on a sole-source basis as a logical and efficient way to provide this support.  Based upon these criteria, it is determination that the selection of Stratus Consulting for this modification would be in the best interest of the Government.
Request two-part modification:
1) Change to Task 5.   In order to maximize the quality and utility of the two background papers prepared under Tasks 1 and 2 of this purchase order, and based upon the extensive discussions at the workshop, the contractor shall incorporate post-workshop comments on the background papers from all interested workshop participants into the final project report under Task 5.  Additionally, the contractor will expand the scope of the final project report to include both the modified background papers as well as an extensive (minimum of 30 pages) write-up of the workshop, with major focus on the adaptation planning issues and solutions to those issues identified by the workshop participants.
2) Additionally, the period of performance will be extended to September 30, 2010.
As stated above, USEPA intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis.  Nevertheless, if any firm feels they are capable of performing this work, please submit evidence of such capability within 15 days of this posting.  Telephone calls will not be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via email to honegger.harold@epa.gov.

<DESC>The bureau has an extensive training, support and expertise investment developed over 20 years in Trimble software and hardware and adoption of incompatible products would introduce an unwarranted re-training and support expense.  In addition, state and Tribal programs, the Fish & Wildlife Services (FWS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and industry are heavy users of Trimble products and this compatibility would be lost if incompatible products are selected.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>Estimated cost of project is between $1-5 Million<br /><br />The purpose of the project is to repair portions of the Buffalo Confined Disposal Facility #4 (CDF 4), perimeter dike. CDF 4 is located in Buffalo Harbor, NY and is situated in the outer harbor, adjacent to Lake Erie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is designed to contain sediment dredged from the federal navigation channel within the harbor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CDF consists of a perimeter dike which is constructed of sheetpile, core/filter stone and armor stone which serves to contain sediments within the facility and to protect the contained materials from waves, storms, and lake currents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed work consists of repairing nine reaches of the perimeter dike totaling approximately 640 lf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Repairs will consist of grouting the voids within the stone of the perimeter dike adjacent to and on the CDF side of the sheet pile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent of the grouting is to re-establish a physical barrier near the center of the dike in areas where some of the sheet pile has shifted vertically and separated from the underlying filter stone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The grout must be placed to fill the voids in the dike stone in an area about 4' wide by 12.5' vertically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grouting will start at the base of the armor stone and proceed downward through a 5-foot layer of underlayer stone, a 2.5-foot layer of core stone and extend about 5' into the filter stone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor will be responsible for providing a grout and grouting system to fill the voids as specified and verify that the installed material has adequately met contract requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Work will also include welding of some sheet pile interlocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to actually grouting the wall, the contractor will construct a test section where a replica of the wall is built, flooded with water, grouted, pumped out, and broken down to test contractors grout mixture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work will likely require that all work be performed from floating plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The plant may be located inside or outside the CDF perimeter. It is anticipated that a drill rig will be used to core through the dike stone to provide access for the grouting operation.</p>

There are several options to the contract.  The options, if they are exercised, may not be exercised in numerical order.  If the options are exercised, their performance periods will be consecutive. The time for contract completion of each option will be determined by allowing a rate of one calendar day for each 2,500 cubic yards removed. The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 2,500 cubic yards per calendar day.  The work is estimated to cost between $4,500,000 and $5,500,000 (basic and options).

Ideally the HSI/VSI PFD selected should be able to plug and play with the current analog signals, replacing the existing attitude and heading reference systems with individual or combined multi-function display(s).  The capability to accept additional inputs to include ARINC 429, Mil-STD 1553B, Ethernet, moving map, and FLIR Video is highly desireable.  The replacement PFDs/MFD should fit the current form factor for the existingHSI/VSI PFDs (ID-2277/ID-2278), but removal of the existing center spacer to allow a combined display is anticipated.   It needs to be able to display our current command instrument system as well as attitude reference data and heading reference data, and provide precision and non precision approach guidance.  Also needed is the ability to display distances in kilometers (KM) or nautical miles (NM) and a brownout symbology set for future growth capability.   It will have to be able to meet flight certification requirements as determined by the Army Aviation Engineering Directorate, including compliance with Flight Critical requirements IAW MIL-STD 461E as modified by ADS-37A and MIL-STD 810G and  ADS-71.   All software needs to be certified to DO 178B level A.  Suppliers capable of manufacturing and delivering this item as specified above must so indicate, by writing to Commander, US Army CECOM LCMC, ATTN: RDER-PRA-AB (Corwin), Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5043.

This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is ATC Flight Simulator Company.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $165,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 333319 applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item L10PS01873.  However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by March 10, 2010 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with ATC Flight Simulator Company for the requirement stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kathy Colson at 208-387-5545 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT. 

All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information for a commercial molecular-beam epitaxy system (MBE). The MBE system will be used to make a variety of semiconductor crystal structures for our semiconductor quantum optics experiments. With near atomic-layer accuracy, a device structure can be built containing different material and alloy combinations of aluminum, gallium, indium and arsenic. The system contains no toxic gases and operates in a sealed, ultra-high vacuum chamber. We seek a module MBE system that can be expanded and that is completely computer controlled and automated. The cluster tool component must accommodate the semiconductor wafer manipulations. All responses should clearly specify that the vendor is interested in providing a complete Molecular Beam Epitaxy System (MBES).

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an MBES that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
NIST seeks information on an MBES that meets the following specifications, includes installation of the equipment in a cleanroom environment, and may require minor modifications in order to facilitize the laboratory for installation of the system:

a. The system must be a fully computer automated, cluster-tool driven MBE system that can be used to produce ultra-high purity epitaxially deposit gallium arsenide, aluminum arsenide, indium arsenide and related materials and structures.

b. The MBE system must have fully automated transfers and process controls, for example fully automated preparation, baking, MBE growth and, most importantly, fully automated transfers between these subsystems using a cluster tool system.

c. The system must be a two-chamber MBE system with additional loading, preparation and cluster chambers:

    1) The MBE chambers must have a vertical profile wherein the substrate faces downward during operation.
    2) The MBE chambers must have ion and cryogenic pumping with a base pressure at or better than 5x10-11 torr in typical idle conditions, i.e., with all sources in growth-ready stand-by mode.
    3) The MBE chambers must be fully liquid nitrogen cooled.

d. The system must have a loading, preparation, and growth chamber linked by a central cluster tool found in the commercial semiconductor industry.
    1) Integration of band-edge temperature measurement directly into MBE computer growth software in real-time.
        a) Integration of laser optical thickness measurements into MBE computer growth software in Real-time (i.e., crystal growth software run on real-time laser optical thickness Measurements).
   2) Loading of wafers from a loading chamber into a preparation chamber (for 400C degas) then moving the wafer from the preparation chamber to the cluster took, all done automatically via computer control.
       a) Additional 150 ft of triax and coax lines for liquid nitrogen to connect the MBES to liquid nitrogen.
       b) 30 ft by 30 ft class 10,000 hard-walled cleanroom with hard-walled entry divider.
       c) (1) Solvent and (1) acid hood, support DI water system for hoods and other necessary subsystems, 8-port liquid nitrogen phase separator.

2. INSTALLATION:
a. The main system fits inside an 8 ft x 8 ft area, but is broken down into smaller pieces for transport and moving through hallways. With electrical racks spread out to allow access, the system will occupy a room of 30 ft x 30 ft (see (d)(2)(b) above).

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.

Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Carol Wood, Contract Specialist, at carol.wood@nist.gov, with no later than 3:30 PM on Wednesday, March 3, 2010. The report must include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:
 
1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.

2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).

3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.
 
4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to eduardo.baca@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).

5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&D) Sources Sought notice for a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for the Womens Health Initiative 2010-2015 Extension Study. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals,
proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.

I. 	Background and Purpose of the WHI  

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was established to elucidate the etiology and prevention of major causes of disability and death in older women (age range 50-79), namely cardiovascular disease, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and hip fractures. The program included three clinical trials in a partial factorial design (N=68,132) and a large observational study (N=93,677) for a total of 161,808 participants enrolled (17% minority). The program collected data on outcomes and exposures that span across most disease domains. During the first phase of the program (1993-2005) the three clinical trials and the concurrent observational study were completed. The trials of hormone therapy were stopped early, in 2002 for estrogen plus progestin because of harm for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), stroke, Venous Thrombo embolism (VTE) and breast cancer, and in 2004 for estrogen alone because of harm for stroke and VTE and lack of benefit for CHD. In an ancillary study, women over age 65 had an increased risk of dementia in both hormone arms. The trials of low fat dietary modification and of calcium and vitamin D continued to 2005 as planned.  

The currently ongoing renewal of WHI (2005-2010) enrolled 115,405 women (77% of those eligible) at 40 field centers. The post-stopping of therapy experience of the clinical trial participants in regard to trial exposures and clinical events are being monitored. The 3-year data after stopping estrogen plus progestin have been published, and the other trials will publish post-stopping data in 2010. The additional outcomes accrued in the observational study have been used to extend the clinical trial findings and are being utilized in several ancillary and consortium studies. The WHI data and biologic resources have been made widely available to the scientific community, and in particular two rounds of Broad Agency Announcements have funded 22 investigations utilizing the biologic samples. The current annual retention rate of the cohort is 98%.

II. 	WHI 2010-2015 Extension Study Objectives

A further 5-year observational WHI follow-up study is anticipated from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015. During this time, all WHI participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up of clinical outcomes, return of study questionnaires, and willingness to be approached for future ancillary studies including clinical trials. It is estimated that a total of ~100,000 women (85% of living participants, projected age range 62-95 with 35% over age 80) will enroll in the 2010-2015 extension. 

While it is well known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in American women, it is less appreciated that the vast majority of these deaths occur in older women (women over the age of 80). They account for an increasing proportion of the CVD morbidity and mortality, and suffer from a number of important phenotypes, which include diastolic heart failure, hypertension, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. Elderly women comprise the most rapidly growing demographic in the US population, yet only ~4,500 women over the age of 80 are currently being following in other NHLBI cohort studies. The WHI has a very large cohort of older women with a demonstrated enthusiasm for clinical research; the cohort is rich in clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic data; and it is supported by a strong research infrastructure. This follow-up takes advantage of the WHI cohort and its investigators to launch the next generation of critically important cardiovascular research projects that target older women. The renewal plans to continue support for following the cohort from 2010-2015, with several modifications to enhance its scientific value. The depth of the follow-up will be increased for two important sub-cohorts (hormone trial participants, and African American and Hispanic participants with Genome- Wide Association Study (GWAS) data, N~24,000, with ~8,400 over age 80) but will be scaled back to collect self-reported data only for the remaining (~76,000) participants from the other study trials and the observational study. In addition to the continued follow-up of the hormone trial participants to evaluate long term effects of treatment, both the hormone trial and minority populations will serve as observational studies with a new focus on three CVD outcomes with substantial burden in older women (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism) while continuing current adjudication of CHD, stroke, cancer, and other outcomes. The combined hormone trial and minority GWAS cohorts will have substantial minority representation (~28% African American, 12% Hispanic, and 58% White).  

The CCCs expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to)  preservation of the WHI cohort and obtaining informed consent for ongoing participation; data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and sub-studies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; continue to support a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the field centers; maintain the biological specimen laboratory; solicit and monitor laboratories; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government.

The restructuring of the WHI field centers into up to 5 regional field centers will include funding for coordinating regional activities including, documentation of clinical outcomes, engaging investigators inside and outside current centers to propose analyses and ancillary studies, to perform distributed data analyses, and to train new investigators. Having a limited number of regional field centers will streamline study management and will facilitate ancillary studies within the region, and across regions, compared to having 40 field centers.

The contractor shall continue to provide highly skilled, specialized technical non-personal services in support of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with direct support to the Resource Integration Division (J82) and the Global ISR and Space Division (J84). The Contractor shall support various Planning, Programming, and Budgeting Execution (PPBE) input development efforts in direct support of the CDRUSSTRATCOM. The contractor shall interface with all levels of the USSTRATCOM staff during the development of the Planning Input Memorandum (PIM), Integrated Priority List (IPL), and Program Budget Review (PBR) issue papers. The Contractor shall support various Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) activities to include, but not limited to, requirements generation, architecture planning, technical studies and analyses; operations and acquisition planning; conducting surveys and field data collection; planning, implementation, and evaluation of Space Operations mission/functional areas as defined by Joint Publication (JP) 3-14 and the systems that provide those capabilities.
<p><br />The Contractor shall provide the required support across USSTRATCOM organizations and interface with a working knowledge of the Department of Defense (DoD), the Services, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Central MASINT Office (CMO), Community Management Staff, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Security Agency (NSA) , Defense Information Service Agency (DISA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Secretary of Defense (OSD) offices, the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands staffs, Component Commands and Civil and Commercial organization.</p>

The Contractor shall provide input to and as required generate and update briefings, white papers, concept papers, status reports, command positions, and messages/memos.</p>
<p>Due to the USSTRATCOM effort to convert contracted positions to government civilian positions, a gap has been created between the end of the current contract (31 March 10) and the anticipated conversion from the Air Force Personnel Center. Therefore, the government intends to award a six month extension of the current contract (1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10) to allow sufficient time to conduct the conversion process.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for competitive proposal or a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the government to not compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company can provide the Resource Management, Space Control and Space/ISR Support services at full performance starting 1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10, provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 3 Mar 10.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Beyond Clothing LLC, a small business located in Seattle, WA 98108. This is the second phase of evaluation.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The garments that are being purchased from Beyond Clothing are a variety of military clothing items that provide environmental protection. The following items are being procured:<BR>1. PCU L9 Assault Shirt<BR>2. PCU L9 Assault Pants<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>These items are made by Beyond CIothing only. Beyond Clothing participated in the development of these SOF garments and has the exclusive commercial sales rights to them. Consequently, they are the only commercial source for these items. In addition, Beyond Clothing has the ability to rapidly modify the design of these gaments. Our intention is to conduct two operational evaluations and then using the operational feedback, make adjustments to these garments and procure another round of test articles for evaluation.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A sources sought market survey (W911QY09SS0002) for approved military products was performed in MAR 09. Respondents were invited to a Vendor Day held at Natick on 30 APR 09 where products were exhibited to the APPS IPTs. These garments were developed for SOF applications which are very similar to tactical law enforcement. On 21 OCT 09, these products were selected by the APPS SWAT IPT, based on product characteristics and user priorities.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>These products are being procured as limited quantities of test articles for the planned APPS SWAT operational evaluations. Beyond has the capability to rapidly modify the design of these garments. Our intention is to procure a small quantity (QTY-30) of product to conduct initial operational evaluations (Phase I Completed) and then using the operational feedback from those evaluations, to make adjustments to these garments to improve their operational suitability and effectiveness. We will then procure another quantity (Phase II) of improved test articles for further evaluation. These items will be procured later as pricing for the modified garments becomes available. Should these items be determined to be operationally suitable and effective, they will be placed on the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list. Any future procurement from the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list will be made by state and local agencies under their respective local procurement regulations.<BR><BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>There are no barriers to competition. No further Federal acquisition involvement will be required as this program terminates at the conclusion of testing. Any subsequent acquisition of this equipment will be conducted at the state and local level and is subject to state and local acquisition rules and regulations.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than noon on March 1, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>

RM/GFSC, Administrative Operations (ADO), requires reconfiguration services for the 1st floor of building A. The requirement includes the purchase of new office furniture/equipment, installation of the new furniture and reconfiguration of the existing furniture.
In 2004, Global Financial Service Center entered into an authorized Department of State construction project with/under Hightower Construction in reference to Building C and Renovations to Buildings A and B under contract N62467-00-C-0400, HCC Job no. 5641. At that time, GFSC purchased, furnished and installed Herman Miller Office Equipment (desks, chairs, cubicles and cubicle components) through Alfred Williams & Company. In upholding and maintaining consistent and proper department protocol, Global Financial Services requires procurement of Herman Miller Office Equipment off GSA contract (GS-28F-8049H). GFSC is also recommending Alfred Williams & Company (Herman Miller reseller) provide the equipment, deliver and install the procurement request. If another reseller is awarded this procurement request, they must be able to provide the same protocol to complete the scope of work provided by Alfred Williams & Company.

3. A description of the supplies or services required meeting the agencys needs.

The reconfiguration services for the 3rd floor of building B includes the purchase of new office furniture/equipment, installation of the new furniture and reconfiguration of the existing furniture. Herman Miller desks, chairs, cubicles and cubicle components are the only furniture/equipment that will match the existing furniture throughout GFSC.
4. An identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
The statutory authorities permitting other than full and open competition are as follows: 41 USC 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

In 2004, GFSC purchased, furnished and installed Herman Miller Office Equipment (desks, chairs, cubicles and cubicle components) through reseller Alfred Williams & Company. In upholding and maintaining consistent and proper department protocol, Global Financial Services requires procurement of Herman Miller Office Equipment off GSA contract (GS-28F-8049H).

6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.

Efforts to solicit offers will be attempted utilizing FedBizOpps to publicize the requirement.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be
fair and reasonable.

The Contracting Officer determined the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and
reasonable based on the following documents provided by the vendor: Current purchase order and historical pricing data in contract files for the same work.

8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or statement of the reason a market was not conducted.

Limited market research was completed for this project because Herman Miller is the only vendor able to provide furniture/equipment that will match the existing furniture throughout GFSC. This is a reconfiguration project. No other manufacturers parts and pieces will fit with the existing Herman Miller product.

9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

There are no further facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition:

11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. Herman Miller is the only vendor able to provide able to provide furniture/equipment that will match the existing furniture throughout GFSC because they are the sole owner and operator Herman Miller, Incorporate of Zeeland, MI. An RFI will be publicized to acquire information on alternate sources and methods that may satisfy this requirement and the requirement will be competed at the expiration of this Order. Global Financial Services Center (GFSC) has, within applicable Department guidelines, established space and furnishing standards for all our offices. Standardization permits GFSC to more effectively estimate cost for office reconfiguration, expansion and efficiency when mission requirements dictate necessary changes. Department of State supports competing any requirements among vendors who are able to supply the same product to obtain the lowest cost.

	* Expand the CCW created by CMS by linking existing sources to other data sets thereby increasing the ability to use CCW for research on people with disabilities including CER of health and support services for chronic care, including systems of care.

	* Conduct thorough reviews of HHS and outside efforts in research and evaluation of the effectiveness and/or comparative effectiveness of health and support services for people with disabilities. This must  include a systematic review of published and unpublished studies or data.
	
	* Identify and compare the effectiveness of existing models of community-based care coordination and integration for people with disabilities. Determine best practices and to what extent support services, holistic approaches and health promotion interventions affect the health and well-being of people with disabilities. 

	* Assess Medicaid data reported by a small number of selected states (4 to 6) on both their state plan  and waiver services to identify the types of benefits offered, information reported and data available, and use these findings to propose ways to standardize some or certain services and reporting, i.e. generate greater consistency on how services are used or defined. This will facilitate the development of future CER studies.

	* Based on the assessment of Medicaid data from selected States as mentioned above, develop quality improvement pilot interventions that can be implemented by  states to improve the quality of information reported and allow for comparative data analysis. This will facilitate the development of other future quality improvement strategies.

	* Develop and coordinate a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) taxonomy and/or a health care glossary relevant to providers, policymakers and people with disabilities. Consider the work of Thomson-Reuters and others in completing this task. 

	* Develop a blueprint for continued and future research and data capacity-building in support of CER, and the translation and dissemination of research findings to providers, policymakers, and people with disabilities.

	* Develop and maintain a section of the Office on Disabilitys website to disseminate the Centers activities on CER.

	* Develop a plan to continually evaluate the impact of various products and activities of the Center.
    
The main functions of the Center of Excellence in Research on Disability Services and Care Coordination and Integration will therefore be production, dissemination, implementation, evaluation, data collection and research. There are large areas of overlap between these functions, but the diverse needs of this contract require expertise in a wide range of areas including long-term care policy research and development including data collection and manipulation.   Each of the inter-related functions is integral to the successful implementation of the contract.

<DESC>Scope of work:
<p>This Scope of Work includes three items: 1. A new well pump; 2. New pipe from the new well to the existing water storage tank; and 3. New electrical service for the well pump.</p>
<p>Item #1 Pump<br />The new well pump capacity needs to be a minimum of 700 gallons per minute at a total dynamic head of 100 feet. The new column will be 8 inch in diameter and will be 120 feet long and will be oil lubed. The pump inlet will be connected to an 8 inch suction pipe that is 10 feet long. It will include a galvanized strainer. The new pump motor shall be 20 bhp at a nominal speed of 1800 rpm. An example pump is the Fairbanks Morse Model 10G, 3 stage, with the "B" impeller trim (7.66 inch). The new pump will be powered by a 20 bhp motor. The new pump shall be mounted on a C.I. base. This work item will also include the installation of a concrete base for the well. (Please see drawings.)</p>
<p>Item #2 Plumbing<br />This contract will include all plumbing to connect the new well to the existing discharge into the water storage tank. The new plumbing will consist of standard wall steel 8 inch pipe above ground and 8 inch CL 100 PVC pipe below ground. The connection from steel to PVC shall be with MJ connectors such as the Star Pipe Model RAC 4208<br />StarFlange with IPS PVC pipe gaskets (or equivalent). The first section of PVC pipe connected at the MJ shall be a full length of 20 feet.</p>
<p>Installation will need to be accomplished so as not to damage existing below ground piping and electrical services. There are no known underground utilities where the pipe is to be installed. However, it will be required of the contractor to contact Underground Service Alert to confirm whether any utilities exist.</p>
<p>All above ground steel pipe shall be painted with AMERLOCK 400 epoxy paint (or equivalent). Paint shall extend to ground level or lower. The pipe shall be prepared by removing all greases and oils and shall be wire brushed. All welding scale shall be removed. The paint shall be applied according to manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>All below ground steel pipe shall be bitumastic coated and wrapped with a 10 mil PVC protection tape. These coatings shall extend to one foot above the ground surface.</p>
<p>The above ground plumbing shall include a 6 inch meter section. Included in this section will be the existing water meter that is in the discharge of the original well.</p>
<p>Item #3 Electrical<br />The existing well pump is a 15 BHP pump. The new pump will be a 20 BHP pump, and will be over 100 feet from the existing pump panel. Therefore, the pump panel will need to be moved to the new location with buried electrical service. The existing pump panel includes a water level control system for automatic control of the pump meant to keep the 8000 gallon supply tank full. This control system will need to be included in the pump controls at the new location. Where possible, the existing electrical components shall be used in the new system.<br /><br />A site visit is recommended prior to giving a bid.&nbsp; <br /><br />This work is set aside for emerging small business under FAR 6.203 and USDA set aside policy dated 2009</p>

Technical submission by offerors shall include a statement by the offeror that the proposed tester meets all the technical requirements, accompanied by supporting technical literature. Three examples of Past Performance are to be submitted. The examples shall include: the name of the customer/contracting office; the item which was sold; the price; the date of the sale; and a customer point of contact and verified telephone number. The examples will be evaluated in terms of currency (within the past 3 years), relevance, and quality. Examples showing the same tester as that required, provided under the same terms (installation, warranty, documentation), provided to a Government agency in the U.S., and performed within the past three years, will be considered ideal in terms of relevance. Variations (a similar system rather than the same system, lesser warranty, or no documentation required) will be considered accordingly. Quality will be evaluated in the following areas (the listing does not represent the specific or relative importance of the areas, nor necessarily all areas): timeliness of overall delivery; quality of the system; quality of the installation; ability to deal with any required changes; providing warranty; and meeting customer overall expectations and overall customer satisfaction. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  The Government retains the right to consider any information it finds available pertaining to the past performance of an offeror.<BR><BR>(b) Options. There are no options required in the solicitation.<BR><BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

BACKGROUND OF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCUREMENT

Nursing and Patient Care Services (NPCS) is the nursing service within the NIH Clinical Center, the nations largest clinical research hospital.  NPCS exists to provide nursing care and research support services for patients participating in clinical research studies conducted by investigators within the Intramural Research Programs at the National Institutes of Healths Bethesda campus.  NPCS is organized into two clinical departments, Inpatient Services and Ambulatory Care Services.  As integral research team members, Clinical Center nurses support the design, coordination, implementation, and dissemination of clinical research by NIH investigators, with a strong focus on patient safety, continuity of care and informed participation.

Due to the fast paced often complex level of patient care required within the Clinical Center and the Institutes supported by NPCS, the need for an intensity software system to effectively track and allocate nursing resources has been identified.  There is an emerging need to gain a better understanding of patient care complexity in order to most effectively utilize NPCS nursing resources in addition to extend budgetary and strategic planning capabilities.  In doing so the NPCS will be able to identify and analyze trends in our patient care population and workload that will provide us the opportunity for improved productivity and the highest standard for patient care expectations.   The Nursing & Patient Care Services relies heavily on this system for ensuring daily adequate coverage of nursing staff on the patient care units.  .

<DESC>The USAID health program supports the provision of primary health services to roughly 50% of Haiti's population through a network of 150 NGO and Ministry of Health (MOH) health centers; a social marketing project that distributes and promotes the use of contraceptives, oral rehydration salts and a safe water product; a nation-wide community health project that provides services through community centers and home-based care; support to the MOH to strengthen provincial and central level Directorates, including the National TB Control Program, the National HIV/AIDS Program, and the National Reproductive and Maternal Health Program, with a focus on health systems (drug and commodity supply chain management, health information, financial and administrative management). USAID health funds are used to achieve specific results in child immunization, nutrition, family planning and other reproductive health services, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR HIV/AIDS funding is allocated, for the most part, to projects that also implement non-HIV/AIDS funds with the purpose of achieving an integrated approach to health care delivery, integration of income generation with community care for families living with HIV and AIDS and ensuring that HIV/AIDS is integrated into educational programs, cash-for-work programs and human rights programs.

The trip officially ends when all USGS gear is off-loaded from the charter vessel.

GENERAL GUIDELINES
1.	All areas of the vessel shall be accessible to the scientific staff, unless agreed to beforehand.

5.	The length of the work day will be jointly determined each day by the Captain and the USGS project leader.  In the event of a disagreement, the master of the charter vessel has final authority per Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The Captain has the ultimate authority and responsibility for the ship and all personnel aboard and therefore retains the right to operate the ship in a safe manner based on their best judgment.  With this responsibility in mind, the Captain must ensure that enough crew members are on the vessel to run a safe 24-hour operation.  Sea otters are sometimes captured at night and need to be brought back to the contract vessel for immediate processing.  For this reason, it must be agreed upon beforehand that some reasonable and safe level of support is available around the clock.

4.	Vessel lights, heat, hot water, sanitation facilities (including wash basins, toilet, and shower), galley, and cooking and eating supplies shall be appropriate to support up to  7-10  USGS personnel and vessel's crew members.  Berthing spaces, heads, sinks, and showers will be thoroughly cleaned daily by a vessel crew member.
5.	Vessel shall be capable of providing a hot water shower for each USGS person every two days.
6.	Vessel shall have heated drying area separate from living accommodations and routine work areas, and must be capable of drying wet clothing, rain gear, and dive gear overnight for  7-10  people.  Drying area must be large enough to hang these items away from walls.
7.	Vessel shall have a flat, dry space available for setup and operation of an USGS laptop computer.  8.	Vessel shall have 110-volt AC electricity to recharge USGS computers and radios.

MEALS1.	Three meals per day for  7-10  USGS people shall be provided.  The intended work will require odd working hours and, thus, flexibility in meal times and provision of snack food throughout the day.  Breakfast and lunch may be either hot or cold meals, but dinner must be a hot meal.  Meals must be well balanced, nutritious, palatable and varied.  If special dietary needs (e.g., low-sodium, vegetarian, diabetic, etc.) are required, USGS will notify the contractor at least 10 days prior to scheduled departure of the nature and number of special dietary requirements.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

To be eligible for award the offeror's response to the RFQ must include both PRICE and PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION as described below.</p>
<p>b. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.</p>
<p>1. PRICE INFORMATION</p>

<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references that you provide. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications. <br /><br />Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications. <br /><br />Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.<br /><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, when determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Protestant Evangelical faith.</p>
<p>(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

<DESC><p>BAA 0001-10<br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />FOR<br />DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)<br />INDUSTRIAL BASE INNOVATION FUND <br />________________________________________<br />POINT OF CONTACT: Mr. John Dormer, Contracting Officer <br />Defense Supply Center Philadelphia<br />DLA Contracting Support Office DCSO-P<br />700 Robbins Avenue, Building 26-1<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111 <br />john.dormer@dla.mil</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND<br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF). Congressional Report 111-35, page 96 states "Finally, the committee recommends an additional $30 million (changed to $20M in Conference) to continue the Industrial Base Innovation Fund program. The committee directs that DLA, jointly with the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Industrial Policy, continue to make investments in manufacturing research that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material." <br />http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:sr035.111.pdf</p>
<p>The IBIF web site is located at: https://www.dodmantech.com/ibif/. The DLA is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, all proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that will meet Congressional Direction. The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing research supporting the Aviation, Maritime, Land and Troop Support Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to implement significant manufacturing improvements into these supply chains. Projects executed by and implemented in the lower tiers of the industrial base (i.e. component and material suppliers) are encouraged as they are viewed as more likely to achieve the IBIF goals.</p>
<p>Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $20 million during Fiscal Year 2010 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost limit for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $1,000,000 per proposal with a period of performance of up to 24 months. The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current systems or troop support items.</p>
<p>This BAA shall result in the award of multiple contracts. The Government contemplates award of cost type contracts. Proposals based on a type of contract other than that contemplated shall be rejected and shall not be evaluated and shall be rated as unacceptable. FAR 16.301-3 states that a cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. To be eligible for award of a cost contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources; have an accounting system approved for performing a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules and a prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>Following evaluation of proposals, offerors will be notified of selection or non-selection via the Federal Business Opportunities website and the IBIF website. Offerors of selectable proposals will be notified by phone. Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be destroyed. (One copy of non-selectable proposals may be retained for file purposes). Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability and merits of the proposal. Proposals may be considered for funding of up to $1,000,000 for a performance period up to 24 months.</p>
<p>The vision for the IBIF Program is to continue to make investments in manufacturing research that address defense industrial base shortfalls, especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. The objective is to ensure that the industrial base on which the Department of Defense (DoD) depends is reliable, cost-effective, and responsive to DoD requirements. The IBIF program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors as they relate to the defense industrial base.</p>
<p>The IBIF program is focusing on the transition of technology to the defense industrial base after the development cycle. The emphasis is on improving surge capability for near-term military operations and in areas that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material</p>
<p>2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0001-10 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 5 April 2010 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered. No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same shall be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. This is an unrestricted acquisition. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan. For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462. All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred. <strong>Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be rejected and shall not be evaluated and shall be rated as unacceptable.</strong></p>
<p>3. TECHNICAL AREAS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>The primary focus of IBIF is the defense industrial base. The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land, Maritime, and Troop Support. Supply chains are not directly correlated to a Military Service (Army, Navy and Air Force). For example, all missiles are included in the Aviation supply chain. If there is a missile related proposal, it should identify the specific missile/weapon system and the proposal's position in the supply chain (prime, subcontractor, etc) to implement the IBIF proposal results. The Troop Support Supply Chain includes Clothing and Textile Products (e.g. Uniforms, Body Armor etc.), Combat Rations (e.g. Meals-Ready-to-Eat, Unitized Group Ration, etc.), Construction and Equipment (e.g., Barrier material), and Medical (e.g, vaccine production).</p>
<p>The technology thrusts of interest are Metals, Composites, and Electronics. The highest priority will be placed on investments made in areas that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies; however, each offeror must identify a target implementation for the proposed technology. Proposals without a clearly identified target implementation of value to one or more of the areas of interest in the BAA will not be considered for award. A target implementation must be expressed in terms of a weapon system, weapon system component or other class of militarily significant materiel, for example, F-22, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)vehicle, or Body Armor system. All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; implementing dual use (capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; and manufacturing research that addresses defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material.</p>
<p>4. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Evaluation of proposals shall be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal, using the following criteria listed in descending order of relative importance. See Section 5 for more detail.</p>

B. Summary of the Costs. The information contained in this section should be limited to one page. <strong>The Cover Page counts towards the 15 page limit and shall be labeled as Page One.</strong></p>
<p>2. Section II: Executive Summary: An Executive Summary of the offeror's proposed project is required. This summary shall not be evaluated but shall be used to gain an understanding of the overall proposal contents. It should identify and highlight significant features, summarize innovative claims and unique contribution(s) of the proposal, and include the salient points of the proposed project, including target system applications and the expected outcome improvement associated with the project. The information contained in this section should be limited to two pages. <strong>The Executive Summary page(s) count(s) towards the 15 page limit and shall be labeled as Page Two (and Page Three if appropriate).</strong></p>
<p>3. Section III : Detailed Proposal Information: The following evaluation factors must be addressed in the Detailed Proposal Information:</p>
<p>(1) SCOPE, METRICS TO MEASURE SUCCESS, TIME FRAME FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPECTED BENEFITS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION: Offeror's proposal must explicitly show how its manufacturing research project will target a specific weapon system, weapon system component or other militarily significant materiel. For the primary target implementation a point of contact (POC) must be identified in the proposal. The POC information must include name, phone number, email, and organization code and relationship to the target implementation e.g. program manager. The Contracting Officer or his/her representative reserve the option of contacting the POC to confirm implementation assertions contained in the proposal. Implementations that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not appropriate for IBIF funding. If offeror's proposal designates a single system or item of military materiel for the initial implementation it must also provide a specific path for implementation on other weapon systems/military materiel. For example, the BAA response may be for an implementation on the F-18, but it would also have to clearly show a path for implementation on the F-22, F-35, or other weapon system platform.</p>
<p>Proposals should identify the tier of the industrial base which will implement the IBIF improvement and the timeframe for implementation. Prime contractors or R&amp;D service providers, must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the lower tier DOD supplier. Component and material suppliers must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the Prime contractor and, if applicable, the Military Service Engineering Support Activity. Proposals must include POC information for organizations referenced in the proposal (see POC info above). <br />Proposals should identify the metrics of success for the proposal and the timeframe for putting the technology into production in the target implementation. Metrics should be quantifiable and include baseline, threshold, and objective value estimates. The proposal should address how the manufacturing technology will address short term needs of the Department of Defense and the expected benefits. Address any impediments to implementing the technology and how those impediments will be overcome by the proposed effort. Offerors are cautioned that statements regarding the ability to implement manufacturing technology projects may be validated with Government engineering activities. For example, if an advanced material substitution is proposed the Offeror must demonstrate an understanding of the issues associated with and a schedule for getting the proposed substitution approved or qualified by the Cognizant Engineering Authority.</p>
<p>Proposal should address how the proposed technology will transition to the industrial base. The requirement is for a clearly written assessment of the need for the technology within the industrial base, the specific sectors where it will be implemented, and the expected benefits of that implementation in terms of surge production requirements and/or diminishing sources of defense material.</p>
<p>(2) OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT: Offerers will propose a manufacturing research project that includes: (a) The improved Defense manufacturing capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Warfighter, Systems Program Office and/or Logistics Support Organization; (b) Statement of Work (SOW) written in plain English detailing the scope of the effort and citing specific tasks to be performed and specific contractor performance requirements; (c) Detailed technical approach, rationale, and strategy for accomplishing technical goals in support of innovative claims and deliverables; (d) Deliverables associated with the proposed research including a clear description of the results, products, and transferable technology should be provided. (e) Realism of the schedule and milestones for each task in the proposed efforts. Include all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototypes. If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.</p>
<p>(3) PAST PERFORMANCE AND SCIENTIFIC/ MANUFACTURING/ TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE: Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program and their track record in implementing manufacturing research projects. Offerors shall provide the five largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. If no past performance related to manufacturing is available, offerors shall describe their track record in dealing with their comparable major customers and shall include supplemental information similar to that requested above.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance not included in the technical proposal.</p>
<p>(4) ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Offerors shall provide evidence of how the contract shall be managed and show that its organizational structure shall ensure performance stability, reliable customer service and commitment to DLA and IBIF for the duration of the contract performance period. Specifically, offerors shall identify key personnel including the Project Coordinator permanently assigned to the contract; and other personnel with relevant qualifications and experience.</p>
<p>COST PROPOSAL <br />The Cost Proposal shall be submitted in a separate document/volume. The cost of each major cost element and the make-up of those costs shall be presented in the offeror's proposal. Sufficient information shall be provided in supporting documents to evaluate the reasonableness and realism of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, material purchases, fair market rental value of lease items and the method used for making such evaluations. A statement related to the latest DCAA audit and whether the offeror's accounting system has been approved by the DCAA shall be included.

Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted shall be evaluated separately. (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is  4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ``late'' and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

AWARD WILL BE MADE TO THE TECHNICALLY  ACCEPTABLE OFFER WITH THE LOWEST EVALUATED  PRICE
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>OFFERORS, NOTE:  This is to be a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Your proposal should be geared toward being a firm fixed price proposal.  However, note that the Section L.8 Business Proposal instructions require a cost breakdown.  This is correct and should still be done even though it is firm fixed price.  The government will require sufficient information to determine the "reasonableness" of the proposed FFP and the only way to do that is with a cost breakout in the proposal.  The purpose of this notice is to avoid any possible confusion on the part of the offeror.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a contractor-owned/contractor-leased, contractor-operated correctional facility to house a population of approximately 1,750 low security, adult male inmates, that are primarily criminal aliens with ordinarily 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences. The population of approximately 1,750 inmates is presently housed at the McRae Correctional Facility in McRae, Georgia. The current contract will expire on 11/30/2012. <br />
<p><br />The BOP anticipates this requirement will be fulfilled through a single award. A proposed facility may be either an existing facility, a newly constructed facility, or an existing facility with expansion/renovation. Any new construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solictation/contract. The proposed facility may be located anywhere in the continental United States.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Shared services within each fence line is not acceptable.</p>
<p>A Notice to Proceed shall be issued to the contractor when it is ready to accept inmates, which shall occur no later than 12/1/2012.</p>
<p>The BOP intends to award a Performance-based, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract with award-fee incentives. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based work statement based on American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. An Environmental Impact Statement may be required prior to award.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or after 3/10/2010, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on 4/27/10. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions.

The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Course Instruction.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  Notice amended on February 24, 2010 to reflect "to procure the BRAND NAME - Hamilton Company and to add BRAND NAME Justification.  


RECOVERY: 

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research, Laboratory of Metabolism (LM) plans to procure the BRAND NAME - Hamilton Company MICROLAB STARlet.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12  Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.  

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a 100 percent small business set aside.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Delivery be one to two weeks upon receipt of award.

Contractor Requirements:  Contractor shall provide one Hamilton MICROLAB STARlet, parts and accessories, and software.

The instruments shall include the following characteristics as these are vital aspects to the NCI.

a)  Air Displacement Pipetting Channels: shall have air-displacement technology, which is analogous to a hand held electronic pipette. The benefits of this technology include the following:
 In combination with disposable tips, the risk of contamination of critical assays is reduced to an absolute minimum.
 High accuracy and precision from sub-microliter volumes to 1 ml can be reached with the same pipetting channels.
 No system liquid, diluters, valves or complicated tubing is required.
 No dilution effects of samples with system fluid.
 Each channel has a pressure monitoring system to monitor pipetting steps.

b)  Monitored Air Displacement (MAD): shall have air-based pipetting action, the instrument detects clots or empty wells during the aspiration step in real time. Thus monitored air displacement eliminates uncertainty in automated assays by providing reliable, consistent walk-away automation; shall have anti-droplet control (ADC) that compensates for pressure changes in the channels that are caused by the high vapor pressure of volatile solvents in real time. This allows accurate pipetting of highly volatile solvents that would otherwise prevent automation of assays involving robots for this purpose.

c)  Compression induced O ring expansion (CORE) disposable technology: the CORE system attaches disposable tips to the pipetting channels by mechanically expanding an O-ring into a channel inside the tip. This enables a precision of 0.1 mm on all axes with respect to the tip position during all pipetting steps. The system requires no vertical force for tip attachment or tip ejection, thus eliminating mechanical stress and improving the overall system reliability and reproducibility.  The CORE system also enables the user to confirm the size of the tip being used and also run a quick seal verification test, prior to each run to insure that O-ring integrity and seal are intact to avoid leaks during the course of the experiment.

d)  I-SWAP: an internal robotic gripping arm that can operate on the same arm as the pipetting channels.  This allows for a much larger working envelope than a separate arm system design. Since the I-SWAP inherently knows where everything is positioned on the deck based on the input method it saves user time in setting up methods or creating new ones. The I-SWAP also has grip detection system and can reach on both sides of the system deck allowing more flexibility and upgradeability for adding additional peripherals to the system.

e)  Liquid level detection shall offer 3 modes of liquid level detection:
 Capacitance Liquid Level Detection (CLLD)  each channel operates on its own frequency, minimizing the chances of false detection caused by interference.  This creates a more robust system and averts errors.
 Pressure Liquid Level Detection (PLLD)  each channel has its own pressure transducer and can monitor the pressure change in the tip to detect liquid.  This is used for non-ionic liquids and offers the user more control over all liquids pipetted by the system.
 CLLD & PLLD  the two modes of liquid level detection can be used in combination on any step and can provide true liquid extraction (LLE) functionality.

f)  96 tip pipette head - volume range of 1ul to 1mL.  Also offers CLLD on two channels for better reproducible pipetting performance.

g) Barcode reader- The auto loader barcode reader offers sample identification confirmation for all pipetting steps.  It also confirms the correct carriers and lab-ware based on the method the user is running and also offers a continuous feed option to increase the systems overall throughput.

h) Software shall offer an easy to use interface while still providing complete control over the system.  There are multiple wizards available to allow the user to quickly set up standard pipetting routines. The software shall offer an export package feature which assists remote access and troubleshooting by the vendor technical support.

Contractor shall be responsible for installation and training of this instrument.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: 

The Laboratory of Metabolism (LM), Center for Cancer Research, NCI, is requesting a MICROLAB STARlet Automated sample handling system from Hamilton Company.  This system will allow the LM to enhance its participation in the Metabolomics program, within the NCI, to discover, develop (and license) novel small molecule biomarkers for cancer, toxicity, radiation exposure and other diseases.  The discovery of biomarkers is a given samples it sometime exhibited by only a subtle, minute yet significant change between a control and treated sample.  Because of this, sample preparation process must be consistent and standardized, to prevent false positives from occurring because of inconsistent handling.

The Microlab STARlet robotic sample handling station from Hamilton Company offers a versatile instrument with high-throughput automation associated with sample preparation as well as many integrated processes designed to ensure the most accurate, precise and reproducible results obtainable in pipetting systems.  A number of inherent features are provided. These include ease and flexibility of use, unique software features such as protocol debugging, file management and system interface capabilities, precise liquid level detection using capacitance for conductive liquids and the pressure signal detection method for non-conductive organic solvents. The STAR robot arm has a monolithic pipette head which is used to perform many pipetting tasks one 96 well at a time with great precision and reproducibility due to accurate disposable tip placement. The Hamilton STAR system will provide more advanced technology and process control features which are patented and are not available on other systems.  These features are described above.


Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed to the aforementioned individual above.  

When submitting your request, please include complete mailing address, DUNS number, point of contact name, email address, phone and fax numbers.  Estimated issue date of the solicitation is February 16, 2010 with an estimated due date of March 1, 2010.

No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS ONLY AVAILABLE TO LOCKHEED MARTIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS DESIGNERS, INC. (LMSD) FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of issuance of Modification 0009 to Task Order 0030.  Task Order 0030 was previously competed and ultimately awarded to LMSD, Inc. under an existing Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantities (IDIQ) contract (TIRNO-06-D-00013); LMSD, Inc. is a large business.  They were selected for award because no small business responded to the solicitation for Task Order 0030.  Modification 0009 was executed as a performance-based fixed-price action

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 provides extended health care insurance coverage for workers who would have otherwise lost health insurance coverage upon becoming unemployed.  The individual was responsible for 100% of the insurance premiums due under COBRA continuation coverage.   Under Recovery Act legislation, individuals whose employment was involuntarily terminated after Aug. 31, 2008 and before Jan. 1, 2010, and who elect COBRA health continuation coverage, are entitled to receive a 65% subsidy on their COBRA insurance premiums.   The involuntarily terminated individual is required to pay 35% of the COBRA insurance premium.  The former employer (or, in some cases, multiemployer health plan or insurer) pays 65%, and may recover their payment by claiming the amount as a credit on their quarterly employment tax return.  

This opportunity provides software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the IRS Integrated Customer Communications Environment (ICCE) program.  ICCE provides software applications and connections for both phone and web interactive applications, including economic stimulus related applications.  The existing economic stimulus component of ICCE is being modified to accommodate Voice Response Unit (VRU) message changes and menuing in response to legislative initiatives resulting from the recent enactment of COBRA changes contained in ARRA legislation.

<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationProventia softwareEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.	Requesting Agency:	Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 787722.	Nature and/or description of the action:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network and Security Operation Center (NSOC) is in need of licenses for IBM Proventia.  This network intrusion prevention system is required for operation and maintenance of IPS units inhabiting the One VA network across the US.  The IBM Intrusion Proventia System (IPS) is a device designed to stop Internet threats before they impact the Department of Veterans Affairs and delivers protection to all three layers of the network: core, perimeter and remote segments. The IPS is designed to:       Stop threats before impact without sacrificing high-speed network performance        Provide a platform for security convergence that helps reduce the cost of deploying and managing point solutions        Protect networks, servers, desktops and revenue-generating applications from malicious threats        Conserve network bandwidth and prevents network misuse/abuse from instant messaging and peer-to-peer file sharing 3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  The VA-NSOC does not currently have enough device licenses to activate the IBM IPS devices within the VA. This network intrusion prevention system is required for operation and maintenance of IPS units inhabiting the One VA network across the US.  The IBM IPS is a device designed to stop Internet threats before they impact the Department of Veterans Affairs and delivers protection to all three layers of the network: core, perimeter and remote segments.  The specific requirement for this acquisition is for the purchase of 21 each Proventia GX5108-C Spare Licenses, part number GX5108-C-L-P and one year full maintenance and software updates, part number GX5108-C-L-M.  19 each Proventia GX 5108-CF Spare Licences, part number GX5108-CF-L-P and one year full maintenance and software updates, part number GX-5108-CF-L-M.1 each Site Protector Premier, part number sp-PRM-P and software maintenance, part number sp-prm-m.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR Part 6.302-1(c) Application for brand name descriptions This is a brand name warranty purchase using the authority of FAR  Part 6.302-1(c)  The contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem that only one source, in this case brand name, will fill this requirement. Resellers that reflect savings to the Government are permitted.5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The continued use and cost of maintaining the existing solution for updates and technical support is less than the cost of replacing and re-training personnel would outweigh the cost of additional licenses and maintenance..  In addition to this the potential data leak, Personal Identifiable Information compromised and potential network intrusion would cost the VA immeasurable amount in monies, resources and material in corrective actions.   6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  All SEWP IV orders are placed under existing IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) contracts, and thus are not required to be synopsized pursuant to FAR 16.505 (a)(1).  The SEWP IV GWAC is composed of five (5) groups of contracts.  At a minimum, to provide Fair Opportunity as required by FAR Part 16, all contract holders within any one individual group must be provided the opportunity to quote. The contract specialist shall utilize the SEWP IV RFQ and search tools, which automatically provide the Fair Opportunity groupings when selecting contract holders.7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  SEWP and GSA have already competed the products on their schedules.  The previous price competition ensures that the pricing of the latter orders are considered fair and reasonable. 8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  These items are widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement. 9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii)	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. Purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed because the brand name is necessary to meet the Governments needs as stated in numbers 4 and 5 of this document.10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.RFI #59907 was posted to SEWP on June 19th running through June 25th with the following vendors responding:1.	iGOV2.	Immix Technology3.	Patriot Technologies4.	Intelligent Decisions5.	Sword and Shield11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Solicitations for future requirements will utilize brand name or equal language, if it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The current requirement must be solicited using a brand name description because the Government needs to create an exact copy of a system that is currently in use.12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/Requirements and Contracting Personnel Must Certify).I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Governments minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  (FAR Subpart 6.303-1(b))

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS     PALO ALTO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM                 3801 MIRANDA AVENUE         PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA 94304JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following Justification and Approval, the proposed contract described below may be established through other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C.  8127(c) as implemented by IL 049-07-08, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), and FAR 6.302-2(a)(2), Unusual or Compelling Urgency.1.	CONTRACTING AGENCY:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, Consolidated Contracting Agency is responsible for the contracting action as described herein and will enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  The solicitation number is VA-261-10-RP-0102.2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The request is being procured exclusive of competition, for a specific vendor, on a sole-source basis.  The award will be made to Hughes Group, LLC, as a firm fixed price contract.  The projected period of performance is a basic year plus four option years. 3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: This procurement is for nonaseptic janitorial services at the VA Palo Alto Research Facility, 701 and 733 N. Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, CA 94043-3208.  The estimated price of the contract is $350,000.00.  4.	AUTHORITY CITED: This service is being procured pursuant to FAR 6.302-2(a)(2). The preceding cited authority provides for purchase from a sole source when there is an unusual or compelling urgency such that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals. 5.	ANNOUNCEMENT OF REQUIREMENT: This solicitation was advertised in Fedbizopps as a direct award due the authority cited in #4 above. 	6.     EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Due to the circumstances described in #4 above, 	        competition will apply to this action.  Additionally, it should be noted the previous contrct was 	        issued for only one year, on the belief that the Research Department would only be at the 	        Shoreline facility for one year, while their on-campus facility was enlarged and renovated.  		        Sometime during the course of this year, a determination was made, changing Research's	        intended occupancy at Shoreline to an indefinite period.  Therefore, a new contract needs to be	        executed.  The follow-on award would have been to the incumbent, Corners Construction, 	        however Corners is currently under investigation concerning their Service-Disabled Veteran 	        Owned Small Business status.  Until further notice, the SAO West Director has stated no 	        awards are to be made to Corners.  this direction came at a time close to the end of Corner's	        on year contract, therefore there is no time to conduct a competition by the time it ends, on 	        February 28, 2010.7.	FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION: A Price Negotiation Memorandum will be prepared which will detail the actions taken by the Contracting Officer to ensure fair and reasonable pricing.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONPage 2Subject: VA-261-10-RP-0102/VA Palo Alto Research Facility Janitorial8.	MARKET RESEARCH: Due to the circumstances described in #4 and #6 above, nocompetition will apply to this action.9.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COM PETITION: Due to the circumstances described in #4 and #6 above, nocompetition will apply to this action.10.	INTERESTED SOURCES: Award to be made to Hughes Group, LLC of Lakewood, WA. 11.	AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  Due to the circumstances described in #4 and #6 above, no competition will apply to this action.12.	CONTRACTING OFFICERS'S CERTIFICATION: I hereby determine that the facts and                                                                                     representations under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief._______________________                                   	         ______________________William L.
