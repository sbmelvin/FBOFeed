Please read this document in its entirety, before placing any bid to do this work.   No contractor claims will be submitted for failure to read this and fully understand the job.   Questions will be answered prior to submitting your bid, this will be done at or just after a pre-bid walk through.   

A pre-bid walk through of this location will be provided, and it is strongly recommended that you attend so you can accurately price this job.  

The intent of this project is to upgrade the perimeter cameras. The Government will NOT supply any equipment, cameras, materials, etc. The contractor must provide all labor, materials, hardware, connectors, lift rentals, ladders, licenses, permits, electrical work, etc.  (NOTE:  The digital video recorder these will be installed onto is already provided and installed).

There are eight (8) existing 15? perimeter domes installed, with cameras inside of these domes.   These domes and cameras will be REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF by the winning bidder.   The concept is to replace each of the eight (8) perimeter domes with a new Extreme CCTV, EX82D8V8 style camera, in white (Web link to camera is here:  http://www.extremecctv.com/products/uploads/PDF2/EX82DXL_V12.pdf)
 
(The cameras will have to be white, not black)


The contract will require the existing cameras to be removed and replaced with Extreme EX82D8V8 cameras with EXPS.008 power supply from Extreme and the EXMB.051w cable managed bracket.   This will require the contractor to also supply and install 110VAC to 24VAC step down transformers, mounts, brackets, NEMA 6P outdoor enclosures, DITEK surge protection, wire protection, etc.  There Government will not furnish any materials or equipment; the winning bidder will provide everything needed.   If the cable and wire are acceptable, then they may be reused.  If they are not acceptable, the contractor will be responsible to replace them with new wire/cable if there is any problem with the existing cables (meaning if any interference, lack of signal, etc.).   To date, the images on the CCTV system all appear at the headend.  New BNC connectors will be supplied and installed by the contractor, on both the camera side and the recorder side.   On the camera side, all connections should be properly spliced, protected from shorts/moisture, PLUS taped/shrink wrapped as an additional measure.  The winning bidder must also provide for disposal of the old cameras, and housings.  There is an existing Ademco AVDR200 digital video recorder that the cameras will be landed onto, which is installed in the Security Office on the first floor of this facility.    Contractor is responsible for setting the display properties on the digital recorder, per camera, day and night, after the new cameras are installed.   Contractor will supply and install DITEK surge protection on the camera side ? protecting power and video to the camera.  


 
US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service

There is to be installed for the US Customs House, located at 200 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19106 a complete and functional Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System.    The contracted installer of these specialized electronic systems will herein be referred to as the Contractor.  
 
The Contractor:
?	Will call US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service Inspector Steve Skipp at 215-521-2107 to discuss the concept of the systems contained within the scope of work BEFORE beginning any work.  

?	Will prepare a schedule of dates and times that the installation will be performed, including the anticipated completion date. This information shall be updated and the revised schedules provided on a regular basis.  Fax all schedule information to 215-521-2168, and update regularly.  Or email these updates to steve.skipp@dhs.gov

?	Will notify the contracting officer in writing if the system(s) proposed within this scope of work is not able to be installed as specified or will not function as specified BEFORE submitting any quotation.  No extra fees will be paid for required parts omitted from this scope of work or labor required to make the systems work as intended.  If a change order is necessary during the course of the project due to unforeseen circumstances like needing to add a camera, all associated charges that might arise from this change must be accounted for, as no additional monies will be paid above the change order itself.    (I.E.  If issued a change order to add a camera, the contractor must quote the camera AND labor or any add on devices to make this work)

?	Will furnish all materials, high lift machines, tools, brackets, fabrications for brackets, connectors, crimps, wire, etc. that are necessary.  The Government will not furnish any materials or equipment.

?	Will install the cameras in the approximate locations of the existing domes, with the approximate views currently being provided.   There will most certainly be occasions that will require a camera to be moved around a corner, lowered, or field of view changed several times once installed, depending upon a collective agreement reached between the Federal Protective Service and GSA.  

?	Will install each camera, replacing the large domes with the newer smaller cameras.   These replacement cameras are the Extreme CCTV EX82D8V8 cameras.  They contain two cameras ? 1 black and white and 1 color camera.   Both are variable focal length cameras and this camera contains an infrared LED light source.   These cameras will need to be adjusted during the day AND at night, to ensure proper focus, field of view, photocell changeover to night and changeover to day, plus infrared saturation.   The night time adjustment must be scheduled through the Property Manager?s office.  

?	Will install DITEK surge protection at each camera to ensure surge protection from both AC surges and from surges through the coax cable.   

?	Will install a small outdoor NEMA 6P enclosure to house the splices, step down transformer, etc. at or near each camera in accordance with approval from the Property Manager if this cannot be accomplished from inside the building.   In other words, some buildings have their splices on the inside of the building.  Extreme care must be taken to ensure aesthetic appeal.  


US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service

The Contractor:

?	No wires or nema boxes should be visible, since all of the cameras on this building need the optional parapet mount.  In this scenario, the nema box can be mounted on the roof side, at the base of the parapet pole, and avoid being seen.   

?	Some cameras may need to be relocated around the corner or lowered, if the field of view is not adequate or unnecessary overlap occurs.   

?	The mounts included with the cameras are NOT to be used.   Each camera must be installed using the optional Extreme CCTV parapet mounting bracket if camera is currently a parapet mount OR the Extreme CCTV optional cable managed bracket if wall mounted.     

?	All wires, if being reused, will have new cable strips done by the contractor, new spade connectors, BNC connectors, and so forth.   All BNC connectors will be taped, all wire splices soldered and both shrink wrapped by the contractor.   

?	Will insure and mount all devices in accordance with manufacturers printed directives while meeting UL standards, NEC Codes, etc.

?	Will provide electrical work/service necessary for any device in this scope of work that requires power.  If the contractor works out an arrangement with an electrician and the electrician fails to perform, the responsibility to get electrical power to each item is still upon the security contractor who wins this award.  No extra monies will be paid for electrical work relating to this project.   

?	Contractor will provide ?housekeeping? of all cables at both the camera and the head end.  It is required that things will be neat, orderly, and labeled as part of this job.  

?	Will conduct 90% of all work themselves and only subcontract electrical work for electrical needs required to make these systems work.   

?	The Contractor will fully program and fully test all aspects of all systems installed and all systems that they integrated this system with.  

?	Will schedule a formal instruction session and train all personnel on the operation of all systems installed. A copy of all operating manuals, written instructions, etc. will be left in the Security Office upon completion of training.

?	Where wire is required, will use only plenum or riser wire as required by code.

?	Will adhere to all codes national and local to include the ADA, UL, National Electrical, Fire and Safety Codes.

?	Will conceal all wires by placing wire in EMT, in the walls, in the ceilings and in the doorframes to ensure tamper resistance.  Wires are not to be exposed or visible.  No 



?	plastic wiremold will be used.  Every attempt will be made to fish the wires inside of the walls before using EMT.


US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service

The Contractor:

?	Once the job is completed and before the final payment will be processed, the contractor must complete all forms issued by The US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service along with, ?as-builts? depicting the location of each specific device for any and all CCTV cameras installed by this bid, or integrated with something in this bid, to include wiring paths, junction boxes, etc.  These as-builts must be prepared in Autocad and delivered both on paper and in electronic format.  Autocad R14 thru LT2004 is acceptable.  Must do a final walk through of the system with a US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service representative to ensure system is complete and acceptable before final payment to vendor will occur.

?	The contractor will conduct at least 90% of all work themselves and not subcontract more than 10% of the work.   

?	Will insure all devices are mounted in accordance with manufacturers printed directives and meet UL standards.

?	Will install system in accordance with all codes and standards set forth by, but not limited to, The National Electrical Code, BOCA, Underwriters. Laboratories, Local Jurisdiction Having Authority, with a minimum of shielded plenum wiring using plenum or riser wire as required by code/standards.   All wiring will be concealed and of a gauge no less than 18 with 4 conductors and copper stranded in composition.  No mechanical pulling of wires.

<DESC>The National Park Service anticipates issuing a Prospectus this winter season for providing medical services in Yellowstone National Park.  Since most of the facilities will be inaccessible during the winter season, parties interested in this business opportunity can view the properties during a scheduled site visit on Tuesday, October 24, 2006.  The site visit is not required to submit a proposal for the Prospectus, but attendance is encouraged.  The operations at Lake Clinic closed September 25 and Old Faithful Clinic closed October 6.  Mammoth Clinic is open year round.  Access to the closed facilities will be available, although potential bidders will not see the services in operation.  No questions specific to the Prospectus will be entertained during the site visit.  Questions specific to the Prospectus will be answered after the Prospectus is issued.  The site visit will view existing concession facilities and address questions about the existing Concession Contract.  As a result of the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, the current concessioner does not have a preference in the renewal of its contract.  The annual gross receipts for this Concession Contract averaged close to $1.9 million from 2003 through 2005 under the current concessioner.  Interested parties must R.S.V.P. by October 20, 2006 for the site visit, to Sue F. Williams, Business Management Division, Yellowstone National Park at 307-344-2271, or via email at www.sue_f_williams@nps.gov SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Information regarding the release of the Prospectus will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities @ www.fedbizopps.gov and on the National Park Service Concessions Website @ http://www.concessions.nps.gov/Prospectus.cfm

<DESC>A sole source award is contemplated with Coherent Systems International Incorporated, Lexington Park, MD to provide Ground Mobile Gateway (GMG) field test support.  Coherent is the sole developer of the GMG and is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  The contract schedule anticipates award for test support in November 2006 with test support beginning immediately following contract award.  The contract will require the contractor to provide support for all Ground Mobile Gateway system components during operations supporting military exercises, demonstrations and operational assessments at stateside and overseas locations.  The GMG is a prototype tactical system consisting of an integrated suite of communications and networking equipment installed in a highly modified, HMMWV-mounted -788 equipment shelter.  Four HMMWV systems are currently being developed by Coherent and field support is required after system delivery to support testing and integration at the operational units. The major components include, but are not limited to,  Global Positioning System receivers, central processing units, routers, Joint Range Extension (JRE), AN/PRC-117(F) radios, PRC-150 C radio, Situational Awareness Data Link, MIDS LVT-2 Link-16, MRC-185 (Rover III), INMARSAT-B, Cellular Base Station, Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), and Tactical Operations Center Inter-Communications System (TOCNET).  Associated with the systems are the appropriate antenna systems for fixed and mobile operations. The field support scope will include GMG transportation, set-up, operation, maintenance, troubleshooting and repairs as requested by the end user. The objectives of the field support are: (1) to orderly integrate and transition the GMG to the operational users and (2) provide technical support until adequate numbers of military personnel have been trained to operate and maintain the four GMG systems.  Coherent is the only company that can accomplish the level of field support to meet the anticipated GMG test schedule.  As the system developer/integrator of the first generation prototype system, only they have the requisite knowledge regarding equipment installation, inter-/intra-connectivity and operational experience to provide the appropriate level of field support in the time frame required.  The Government intends to award a sole source contract for GMG field support with only one source under the authority of FAR6.302-1. See Numbered Note 22.  Submit within 30 days of publication, to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Reno, NV has a requirement to design, fabricate and install a fence.  The fence will be approximately 375 feet long and eight feet tall.  The fence will include a section of approximately 20 feet that will cross the watercourse formed by the runoff of Ash Springs.  Project and stream crossing diagrams will be provided.  Ash Springs is a popular receation site on BLM land approximately 96 miles north of Las Vegas, on U.S. Highway 93.  Private property is directly adjacent to the most heavily used portions of the site.  The current barbed wire fence is overwhelmed by the use allowing trespass on the private land.  To mitigate the trespass issue and safety issues, the agency wishes to erect a fence along the west and south boundary of the site.  The contractor is invited to make recommendations regarding the specifications and design for the fence and/or the panel crossing the stream.  All work done will be approved by the COR.  There are also special requirements in regards to threatened or endangered fish, and use of equipment or work.  Must use Best Management practices and report spill and do immediate clean up.  No refueling or maintenance of equipment will occur within 250 feet of open water.  Solicitation packages will be available electronically on or about October 5, 2006.  Offers will be due on or about October 20, 2006.  The North American Industry Classification System number for this solicitation is 332323.  The procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award a single-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for technical assistance in logistics and commodity security, with the strategic objective to increase the availability of essential health supplies in public and private services.  The Government will issue task orders that are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price. This award will be issued through Full and Open Competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. organization.

The purpose of this contract is to design, develop, strengthen and, upon request, operate safe, reliable, and sustainable supply systems that provide a range of affordable, quality essential health commodities including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and supplies to clients in USAID country programs. USAID field missions indicate a strong desire for technical support that strengthens all aspects of in-country supply chains, including forecasting, procurement, distribution, management information systems, quality assurance, storage and infrastructure, and medical waste disposal.  While family planning and reproductive health remain a priority in the field and for this contract, field missions are also seeking supply chain systems that are designed to handle a range of health products, including contraceptives and condoms, essential drugs, and select commodities for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases.  This contract will seek to strengthen supply systems for all essential health commodities and create environments (commitment, policies, resources, etc.) that are conducive to their sustainability.  The contract will also collaborate with regional and global partners to support awareness raising and advocacy for commodity security, and explore new approaches to technical areas that include financing, procurement, market development and information systems.  Furthermore, the contract will provide on-going support to USAIDs Central Contraceptive Procurement (CCP) system, including the maintenance of a management information system (MIS).  The countries serviced presently number 45, with field offices in 21 of these countries.

The contractor may also be asked to purchase large quantities of various types of contraceptives, condoms, and possibly other essential health supplies for USAIDs worldwide programs. These commodities are currently being purchased by USAID but this task may be delegated to this contract.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract for the prime contractor is 000.  The authorized geographic code for subcontractors is 935.

Performance under this contract shall be from September 30, 2006 through September 30, 2011. 

The RFP is expected to be issued in early April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<CONTACT>Debra Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     debra.bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>Description:  The U.S. Department of Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS), solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific topics of interest to the MMS Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm.     BACKGROUND:     Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and Artic environments such as offshore Alaska.  The objective of this request for White Papers is to solicit for additional Hurricanes Katrina and Rita research and Artic research. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. The MMS estimates that a total of  $1,125,000 in FY2007 supplemental funding will be made available for research identified through this announcement with $1,000,000 of this amount earmarked for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita research, and the remaining $125,000 for Artic research.  NOTICE: MMS may share the White Papers with other Federal government employees for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the White Papers/proposals shared.     OBJECTIVES:     The topics for this 2007 OSER solicitation include ONLY research on the following: 1) Evaluate top and bottom tendon connectors for Tension Leg Platforms to determine weak points, likely failure mechanisms, and design issues that may lead to premature failure.  Provide recommendations on how to minimize potential failures through design criteria and monitor and inspect critical areas within the connectors.  Provide guidelines for possible use in updating Federal regulations and industry standards.  2)  Evaluate accuracy of polyester subrope damage detection performed by ROVs following hurricanes and other events (i.e., loop current) that exceed the 100 year design criteria.  ROV inspections are used to detect damage to polyester mooring systems and estimate remaining fatigue life if damage exists.   A quantitative evaluation is needed to determine if ROV survey results and resulting life damage estimates are accurate.  Identify non-invasive inspection methods other than ROV surveys and compare ROV inspections to physical insert testing to determine the level of accuracy that can be expected.  Identify the most reliable insert tests to verify that the mooring system is fit for purpose.  Emphasis should be placed on fatigue life predictions.  3) Develop pre-hurricane riser inspection and monitoring program to determine in-situ condition of riser with particular attention to corrosion, preventative maintenance, and repair practices. Develop recommendations for a long term maintenance program to minimize or eliminate conditions that may lead to riser/pipeline damage during hurricanes and major storms events. 4)  Evaluate superstructure icing of both drilling and production vessels and platforms as it relates to conducting activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:     The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety, technology and pollution practices for offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, proposals may be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should address the above stated issues. HOW TO RESPOND:     White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format,  on a CD shall be submitted to the address below. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. White Papers should define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED. The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merit. If your white paper is selected for further evaluation, a proposal will be requested and you must also submit a cost proposal at that time. Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.   The MMS will evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit will be furnished information to assist in the preparation of a complete proposal. This announcement constitutes a solicitation for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.   Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted.       WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the offeror's understanding of the technical issues; (3) the offeror's perceived ability to implement the proposed approach; and (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, and (5) past performance.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor materials and equipment to furnish and install a new sewage float at Ross Lake Boathouse per the plans and specifications.  Contractor shall construct a new sewage float; transport the float to Ross Lake for installation; demolish, salvage, and remove existing float appurtenances that will interfere with the installation of the new sewage float; install the new sewage float; and connect all structural, mechanical, and related systems between the existing and new floats.  NOTE: This solicitation replaces Request for Quotations #Q9471061047, which was cancelled prior to award. Schedule NPS expects to award this project in late November and work can begin immediately after award of the contract.  NPS anticipates that the contractor would be able to work on-site by May, 2007.  The target completion date is July 31, 2007. Background North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) and Seattle City Light (SCL) jointly own, use, and occupy the Ross Lake boathouse, which floats on Ross reservoir and is attached to Seattle City Light's Ross Dam.  Ross Lake boathouse was constructed by SCL in 1995.  The floats for the boathouse are made of foam-filled concrete pontoons.  The boathouse is attached to Ross Dam by a fixed rail that allows it to move vertically as the lake level fluctuates.  Ross Lake regularly fluctuates 120 feet in elevation throughout the year.  The lake is usually within ten feet of full pool between early June and the end of September, although that changes from year to year.  In 2003, NPS became aware that at least one of the sewage holding tanks leak, allowing intrusion of both rain and lake waters, and that all of the tanks are deforming as the level of fluid changes within the tanks.   Location This facility is not accessible via public road.  The reservoir can usually be reached at the north end by a gravel road into the U.S.A. from Hope, Canada, from mid-May to October.  Lake elevations vary through the season, however, and at low lake levels in spring, it is impossible to launch on the north end of the lake.  At the south end a foot trail provides access to Ross Dam and Ross Lake boathouse.  Also at the south end of Ross Lake, Seattle City Light operates a barge on Diablo Lake that could transport materials and equipment to the Ross Dam haul road.  SCL may be willing to provide barge service to a contractor working on the Ross Lake Boathouse. Cellular phones do not work at the project site.  Information and maps are available at www.nps.gov/noca . Solicitation Details This action is a best value procurement open to all sources.  The NAICS code is 237110 and the small business size standard is $31.0 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $100,000 and $250,000.  The full solicitation will be posted electronically to http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about October 18, 2006.  Offers will be due on November 15, 2006.  Prior to award of a contract, the offeror must maintain a current profile in the Central Contractor Registration database (www.ccr.gov); complete the online representations and certifications (www.bpn.gov/orca); and file annual required veterans' employment reports (http://vets100.com).  It is recommended that offerors complete these tasks prior to submitting their offer.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of medical diagnostics; and clinical trials to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.  NIAID has a requirement to apply state-of-the-art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.  The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.

These hydropower projects are already technically prepared for implementation and are anticipated be brought on line by 2010. 

In order to successfully implement the projects, it is critical for the GOR to match the East African Community (EAC) pricing on generated hydropower.  The purpose of this pricing goal is to ensure that energy intensive industries in Rwanda like sugar, tea and cement, will not be at a competitive disadvantage against those from neighboring countries in the EAC.

Task 6:    Advise on Underlying Agreements

Task 11:   Final Report

"Rwanda - Burundi Pipeline Capacity Market Analysis Phase I"  The Grantee (the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Government of Rwanda) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study that would form the first part of a possible two-phase feasibility study with the ultimate objective to establish the feasibility of extending an oil pipeline from Kampala, Uganda to Kigali, Rwanda and Bujumbura, Burundi. This first phase will focus on a market analysis of oil products in Rwanda and Burundi. It will also include an assessment of the required size of the pipeline extension. Should the first phase suggest the project is feasible, funding for a second phase may be requested that would focus on the technical aspects of extending the pipeline.

This phased Feasibility Study is critical for the Government of Rwanda and the Government of Burundi as the rise in use and cost of imported oil products is quickly becoming a key issue for the economic well-being of both countries. Oil is imported from Kenya and Tanzania by tanker trucks, which is very expensive.  In addition, trucking transport can sometimes experience significant delays due to poor road conditions. This oil pipeline extension would reduce the high cost of oil transportation.   

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Rwanda-Burundi Pipeline Capacity Market Analysis Phase I include:

(1)Project Kick-Off Meeting
(2)Review Existing Kenya (3)Uganda Pipeline and Uganda Oil Exploration 
(4)Pipeline Capacity Determination
(5)Proposed Equipment and Services
(6)Development Impact
(7)Dissemination Workshop
(8)Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $150,603 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.

<CONTACT>Jim Gensler, Procurement Analyst, Phone 415-848-4717, Fax 415-848-4711, Email jim.gensler@irs.gov
<DESC>TITLE REPORT SERVICES

IRS requires certified title reports for private and commercial real property (e.g., Lot Book, Chain of Title, Grant Deeds, etc.) as recorded, in the fifty-eight California Counties.  IRS does not require and is prohibited from the purchase of Title Insurance, but will require certification that the data and history provided on any report(s) ordered is complete and accurate.  

Individual reports will be ordered as required, for delivery of the report specified to the IRS within 10 days.  IRS currently orders 600-800 reports annually from Title Insurance providers within California.  A Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Award will be made to the contractor, or contractors, who demonstrate their ability to provide the required reports, at prices deemed to offer the best overall value to the Government.   Administratively, IRS desires the minimum number of providers that ensure coverage for all California counties; therefore multiple best-value awards may result, if a single contractor cannot provide full coverage at prices evaluated to offer the best overall value.

This is an unrestricted, full and open requirement for commercially available title services and will be procured under the test program for certain commercial items (FAR sub-part 13.5) for one base year and two option periods.  The NAICS code is 541191.     All responsible business concerns are encouraged to submit a proposal(s).   Interested providers should contact the Contracting Officer for a copy of the request for quotation, which will be available on or after August 7, 2006.  NO telephone requests for the RFQ will be honored.   Requests may be faxed to 415-848-4711 or e-mailed to jim.gensler@irs.gov.   Requests should include the name of the company, address, point of contact: name, telephone number and e-mail address, and the DUNS number.  NOTE:   Awards can only be issued to a contractor with an active registration in the Central Contractors Registration database at www.ccr.gov.     This registration must be active no later than the due date of the quotes to be eligible for award.     For registration assistance, please call 1-888-227-2423.  See Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

DESCRIPTION

(Note: This BAA Addendum 6 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 06-19)

Without question, warfighters in the current era are required to master a large number of diverse skills spanning the range of cognitive and motor domains increasing rapid timeframes. Historically, measures of learning on key skills in the military environment have relied on qualitative and subjective assessments, often post-hoc, with little opportunity to redirect a learning experience mid-course. The operations tempo (OPTEMPO) of the Department of Defense mandates that warfighters acquire skills quickly, completely and with levels of proficiency that will prove robust in the most demanding conditions.  In response to these challenges, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals to develop quantitative and integrative neuroscience-based approaches for measuring, tracking and accelerating skill acquisition and learning throughout the military. Recent discoveries in the field of neuroscience as well as advances in modeling and analysis techniques have laid the foundation for neuroscience-based strategies with the potential to dramatically accelerate the transition from novice to expert in key military tasks.  This effort seeks to revolutionize learning in the military environment with the goals of creating reliable and quantitative methods for tracking task progression based on non-invasive measures of brain activity and producing a 2X faster progression in an individual?s progress through stages of task learning.

BACKGROUND
In today?s military, a substantial amount of skill development occurs through legacy training programs, developed over decades and based on group outcome measures with qualitative assessment as the norm. These interactions are not able to take into account the skill learning process of an individual, nor how that individual is tracking through the learning process. Although recent efforts have been made to create learning environments that closely simulate actual battle conditions, actual task execution often takes place in diverse and rapidly-changing battlefield environments that create unmatched demands on attentional and emotional systems in the brain.  This effort will specifically evaluate what can be learned from neuroscience-based approaches in order to address this critical issue for the military.

In recent years, the field of neuroscience has begun to elucidate the brain mechanisms that are correlated with the transition from novice to expert.  For example, differences in dominant oscillatory modes as well as changes in coherence and activity distribution have been noted during expertise development for a variety of tasks.  While these advances have laid a solid foundation, many of these discoveries have emerged in static laboratory contexts that lack the full spectrum of sensory, cognitive, and limbic challenges that face warfighters on an ongoing basis. With the overall goal of operationalizing basic neuroscience discoveries, the Department of Defense is interested in investigating the neural substrates of novice and expert states, and principally, methods to reliably speed the progression to the latter.

The critical thrust of the program is to identify non-invasive interventions that will increase the speed of expertise development.  These may include, but are not limited to, neurophysiologically-driven training regimens, neurally optimized stimuli, and stimulatory/modulatory interventions. Complementary components that will further attainment of this goal include the development of neurally-based techniques for maintenance of acquired skills, prediction of skill acquisition based on real-time neural activity, preferential brain network activation, and strategies for understanding the relationship between cognition and emotion in the domain of skill learning.

To attain these goals, proposals are requested for research plans based on understanding and optimizing brain function during task learning.  This solicitation mandates the use of non-invasive sensors to assess brain states including, but not limited to, EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) and NIRS (near infra-red spectroscopy).  Sensor combinations that leverage the strengths of complementary modalities to achieve the program vision are invited, although offerors should consider the long-term program goal of minimizing the footprint of deployed sensor systems.  Designs for novel sensors will be considered as part of this effort only if they are proposed as a solution to address the stated technical goals.

Novel analytical methods for understanding and relating collected neural data are of interest as enablers of the goals for this program, provided these methods are introduced for uncovering physiological correlates, states or patterns that would otherwise be unmeasurable or otherwise computationally prohibitive.
 
Efforts that combine novel stimulus presentation combined with neural measurements will be considered.  However, this program is not focused on the design of virtual reality or other stimulus-generation systems, except within the context of their neural effects.  Submissions that include only stimulus presentation strategies or methods will not be considered.  Proposals offering solutions whose focus is not neuroscience-centric will not be considered for award. Animal models may be considered as part of overall proposed efforts related to human expertise, however, animal-only research will not be considered.  Similarly, while novel non-invasive stimulation methods fall within the scope of this program, proposals that include the use of ingested compounds [such as nootropes, nutraceuticals and other pharmaceuticals] will not be included.

It is expected that each research effort will consist of an interdisciplinary team with sufficient technical expertise and experience to develop novel yet rigorous approaches to the goal of accelerated learning.  Offerors are encouraged to pursue their own teaming arrangements as desired - no recommendations or other facilitation for teaming will be provided by DARPA for this addendum. Highly-innovative submissions are welcome, although arguments for feasibility that are based on sound neurobiological principles are a necessity.

PHASE I DURATION, GOALS, AND MILESTONES
In order to transform basic neuroscience research into a capability for Defense applications, DARPA seeks proposals for Phase 1 efforts for 18 months or less, to achieve the following technical goals:
 
1)	Establish quantitative, neuroscience-based definitions of task learning.

2)	Define a trajectory based on neural activity that describes the transition from novice to expert state.

3)	Demonstrate a positive impact on the transition to the expert state based on novel neuroscience approaches.
 
Throughout the Phase 1, efforts will be evaluated on the technical goals as stated above, and on mandatory program milestones as follows:

1)	Establish baseline neural measures of the independent novice and expert states correlated and confirmed with task performance measures

2)	Describe, at minimum, one interim brain state between novice and expert that is common to 80% of the subjects

3)	Demonstrate a 2X acceleration in the progress of subjects between two interim stages in the novice to expert transition.  A 2X acceleration between novice and expert final end-states is ideal, but not required for Phase 1. 

Offerors to this program will be periodically assessed for progress towards the program milestones above, and demonstrations or other summaries of progress will be expected at a minimum of 6 months, 9 months and 12 months until the end of the effort.

DARPA program management will facilitate and encourage interactions with various Defense components throughout the program. However, the initial experimental tasks that will serve as the platform for experimentation in Phase 1 should be determined by the offerors and should be clearly stated and proposed as part of the effort.  In Phase 1, tasks do not need to be intrinsically military in nature, although it is encouraged if offers have access to those resources. Offerors must validate that the skills under training are militarily relevant and not so clinical or abstract in nature that they cannot be clearly mapped to relevant skills.
|
Based on the success of Phase 1, there is the potential for a Phase 2 effort to mature successful demonstrations into prototype systems for transition to operational use. Proposers should outline a Phase 2 effort, and consider the necessary research and technical efforts to develop a successful prototype neuroscience-based system for eventual deployment in field, simulator, classroom, or office settings.  A cost volume is not required for the Phase 2 description.

PHASE 1 FULL PROPOSAL FORMAT
The general format and content for the Phase I full proposal, including guidelines for the technical and cost volumes, follows the guidelines specified in for the main BAA06-19, that can be found at the website http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa06-19pt2.html.

The technical section for the Phase I full proposal must include the following elements as part of a quantitative and integrative approach to measuring, tracking and accelerating learning mechanisms:

1)	Concept Definition:  Clearly describe the overarching concept for the proposed accelerated learning approach, including any novel theories or brain networks that underlie the research effort
2)	Technical Analysis:  Provide a detailed analysis of the rationale that supports the proposed concept for accelerated learning
a.	Submissions must include a specific hypothesis of the anatomical, physiological or other biological changes in the central nervous system that will be targeted in novice-to-expert transitions.  Physiological events outside the central nervous system (CNS) are of interest to the program only if they are concretely correlated with CNS changes.  
3)	Research Plan:
a.	Proposals must contain clearly-defined experimental tasks that will allow neuroscience-based discrimination of novice states, expert states and the transition from the former to the latter.  While military-specific content is not a requirement of the experiments, proposals should specify military skills that are correlates of non-military tasks.
b.	Proposals should include basic details on the proposed experimental population, including criteria for categorizing subjects as novices or experts as well as elucidating sources of subjects with unique skills.  Proposals should contain rough estimates of the number of subjects expected for each experiment.
c.	The experimental design should include consideration of appropriate control techniques to distinguish expertise development from potential confounds such as immediate task performance.  
d.	If both animal and human experiments are proposed, animal studies should be presented in the context of their ultimate utility for the human component of the research.
e.	Proposals should specify the quantitative measures that will demonstrate attainment of the Phase 1 goals.  The emergence of metrics from single trial neural events is preferable, though not mandatory, for consideration.  Similarly, while all robust CNS measurements are encouraged, methods that are suited for eventual non-laboratory use are especially welcome.  
4)	Project Milestones and Metrics:
a.	Provide specific, quantitative milestones at intermediate stages of the program to assess progress towards meeting the Phase I milestones discussed above. 
b.	The proposed research effort should be delineated by specific tasks (NOT general research questions) and tasks should be clearly matched to the overall program timeline. 
c.	Proposals must include a clear and concise plan for demonstrating all program metrics, particularly the 2X faster transition between stages leading from the baseline (novice) state to the target (expert) state using neuroscience-directed intervention(s).
5)	Team Composition: Provide a detailed listing of all institutions or entities proposed as collaborators on the effort.  List their roles, responsibilities, and level of effort/contributions to specific tasks or milestones
6)	Phase II Concept: Describe a concept for Phase II development based on successful completion of the Phase I research plan.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON COST VOLUME

In addition to the cost volume contents requested in http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa06-19pt2.html, a budget based on total dollar effort for each technical task (detailed above) is expected.

Since integrated teams are preferred, a concise but complete delineation of any collaborator and subcontractor costs is expected ? for both total effort and contribution to each task.

If equipment is requested as part of the proposed effort, sufficient technical justification is required in the cost volume and its relationship to the technical effort must be detailed.

RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN/ANIMAL USE
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research and the DoD Directive 3216.2.  Please refer to BAA 06-19 (http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa06-19pt2.html) for full details.

<DESC>This is a SMALL-BUSINESS SET_ASIDE acquisition for support of the Worldwide  Warehouse Redistribution Services (WWRS) Program.   WWRS is a web-based redistribution service designed to  facilitate re- utilization of excess serviceable spare parts and support  equipment, previously purchased under the Arms Export Control Act, as a  source for filling Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requisitions. WWRS is designed to:  1) reduce FMS customers? excess inventories,  2) provide access to materiel at reduced cost, 3) reduce lead time through  redistribution of assets instead of new procurement, and 4) enable sellers  to purchase needed FMS assets with the proceeds. Program Overview:  WWRS advertises FMS excess and aligns incoming FMS  requisitions with excess materiel to provide FMS requisition support. All  materiel passes through an in-transit inspection point (IIP) contractor.  At the IIP, WWRS excess materiel is inspected (to include verification  that materiel is same NSN as represented), sanitized, and repacked prior  to transfer to the purchaser.  The IIP will take title to the materiel  prior to transfer on behalf of the USG, thereby maintaining anonymity of  the FMS parties. Materiel which fails visual inspection will be returned  to the selling country at the seller's expense. The IIP will process,  store, and make electronically available, digital photos of all materiel.  The materiel will be photographed individually and in aggregate, on a  digital scale.   All materiel shipments that pass inspection are subject  to normal FMS Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) criteria.  The photographs  will be used in adjudicating SDRs.  The IIP may, on an exception basis, be  responsible for performing on-site inspections at seller locations  worldwide, including high threat areas/regions. The IIP may also be responsible for processing US customs clearance for  incoming shipments and receiving shipments with shipping costs due.  The  IIP may also need to establish and maintain satellite offices overseas  with the capability to receive and transship materiel from within one  overseas location to a buyer in another country. The IIP may be responsible for developing or interfacing software in  conjunction with the WWRS Program office. The IIP will be responsible for invoicing the WWRS office on a monthly  basis. Materiel remains in the possession of the seller until the WWRS Program  Manager (PM) requests the materiel.  The WWRS is a virtual materiel  warehouse with WWRS materiel being listed on a WWRS web page by NSN, MMAC,  noun, annual demand, quantity and price.  Interested FMS purchasers may  browse the WWRS web page to determine availability. Materiel may be  ordered by submitting a requisition with the Routing Identifier Code (RIC)  of 'FWW' (indicating WWRS as the desired source of supply) to the Security  Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) against the appropriate  blanket order FMS requisition case for to the materiel being ordered.  WWRS requisitions are treated as fill or kill requisitions.  The seller  with the lowest priced NSN listed will be selected to fill the  requisition.  When there is insufficient quantity of the lowest priced NSN  to fill the requisition, the next higher priced materiel will be selected.  This selection process will be repeated until the requisition is filled or  all WWRS inventory is depleted.  The remaining unfilled portion of the  requisition will be canceled. Please address each the questions/statements listed below 1. The contractor is only paid for his services after the material is  shipped.  Total processing time may be up to 60 days. The contractor will  be expected to pay shipping to the first destination, and may need to pay  for incoming shipments and then will be reimbursed as part of the  invoicing process.  The largest 60 day accumulated prepaid freight and  services fee to date has been $126,100. Due to system constraints regarding payment the contractor may not be paid  for up to sixty (60) days (ex. Contractor ships item first of month,  Security Assistance Maintenance Information System (SAMIS) runs the batch  of items shipped every 30 days (end of month), then the contractors  invoice submitted at end of month is compared to the SAMIS run and if  there are errors it could take up to seven (7) days to resolve before the  program office signs the invoice and forwards to the Defense Finance and  Accounting Services (DFAS) for payment within 21 days. Discuss how you  will manage your business while waiting sometimes up to 60 days for  payment. 2. Please provide your current facility information and capability to  process several hundred shipments per month. 3. Program activity is likely to occur with large fluctuation in shipment  frequency and number.

HSCG23-06-R-ECB018



1.	QUESTION ? How are the buoys that are shipped out side continental U.S. to be handled, if they are restricted to flat bed loads only as stated in B.9?  Do we have to provide a shipping skid?  Do we have to provide shipping skids for any buoys shipped?  If so to what extent? 

ANSWER ? The only requirement that the Coast Guard has is that the buoys show up at the required destination on flat bed trucks.  For shipments outside the Continental United States, the method of transportation (i.e. shipping container, shipping skid, etc.) is up to the Contractor.  If the Contractor ships the buoys in containers, it is the responsibility of the Contractor/Shipping Company to remove the buoys from the containers once they arrive at the port.  The buoys should then be placed on a flat bed truck for delivery to the Coast Guard destination.

2.	QUESTION ? When shipping the buoys to San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901, Honolulu, HI 96819 and Ketchikan, AK 99901, How will the orders be handled?  How will the units be prepared for shipping?  If two 8x26 buoys are a lot, will two 9x26 buoys be shipped to these over sea ports?

ANSWER ? Buoy shipping Lots are defined in Section B.9 of the solicitation.  The Preservation, Packaging and Packing for shipments is detailed in Section D.2 of the solicitation.  Whatever method of shipment the Contractor employs to transport the buoys from their facility is up to him/her.  The Coast Guard only requires that the buoys show up at the final destination on a flat bed or drop deck trailer (i.e. no containers).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers to Solicitation No. S-AQMPD-05-R-1006 as follows:

Questions and Answers:

1.  P. 4, Estimated hours are for proposal evaluation only  How will number of hours estimated be evaluated?  This is not laid out in Section M.  The estimated hours are evaluated by based upon price/cost which is listed in Section M, M.6 on page 66.

2.  P.12, Task 1.4 references Services Level Agreements, but SLAs are not required as part of the proposal. Can this disparity be reconciled?  No, it is as stated in the RFP.

3.  P. 19: Task 2.9 Please scope the approximate number of databases in use, the number anticipated to be needed, etc. for this task.  Also, please scope the approximate size and complexity of the databases currently in use. There are a dozen or so small MS Access databases to support administrative functions.  There is also a content management system in place to support web updates.

4.  In Section L.7.2, "Proposal Guidelines," the RFP lists "Handling Anticipated Changes in Workload Volume" as one of the items to include in the Management Approach.  Section M.7 lists unanticipated changes" under "Adequacy of Management Plan." Please clarify whether it is anticipated or unanticipated changes in workload. There is always a possibility of workload changes as the organization adjusts to meet desired outcomes.  A dramatic change is not anticipated.

5.  Section L.7.2 requests three past performance contracts. Will the Government clarify whether that is three each for the prime contractor and each proposed subcontractor or whether it is three total?  Three (3) for each prime and sub.

6.  Will the Government consider excluding Past Performance from the 75-page technical proposal limit?  Actually, the Past Performance should be included within the 75-page technical proposal limit.

7.  Will the government provide the names and contact information of contractor employees who are currently performing on the contract? No, such information must be requested in a FOIA Request. 

8.  What is the anticipated date of award for this contract?   The contract is estimated to be awarded  by September 30th.

9.  Appendix C lists the current FTE support levels at each DS facility.  However, it is not clear whether the quantity of personnel listed are solely dedicated to the specific task mentioned or whether they perform multiple tasks.  Would the 
government include the number of FTEs by position as well?  Personnel are not solely dedicated to the specific task.
     
10.  Please provide a percentage breakdown of the evaluation factors  Cost and Technical   None is currently listed in Section M.  As stated, in Section M, M.2 Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost or price and technical merit.
 
11.  In Section L.7.2 you describe the Proposal guidelines which state that the technical proposal is limited to 75 pages.  What page margins, and font types and sizes are acceptable?  Does an 11x 17 sheet count as 2 pages? Does the font type and size apply to tables and figures? 5 inch margins, 12 pitch, times New Roman 
font types  are preferred. 11x17 sheet count as 1 page and yes the font type and size apply to tables and figures.

12.  Appendix C does not properly represent the appropriate staffing levels for this contract.  Will you be releasing a matrix that more accurately breaks down the current staffing for each Required Service area?  No, its up the contractor to properly present the appropriate staffing to perform such task listed in the Scope of the RFP for the required services.

13.  It is unclear to us how you want the information in the Pricing Tables in Section B.2 presented.  We understand we are to provide a Labor Category for each SubCLIN.  For "Estimated Hours" are we to provide our estimated annual hours for one full time equivalent?  For example - If the Labor Category fo

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to list additional questions and answers.  Therefore the questions and answers are listed as follows:

Questions and Answers:

(1)  Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 5.  Section L.7.2 requests three past performances.  In your clarification, you state that the Government requests Three (3) for each prime and sub.   This is a modification to the original requirement of three past performances.  Is it the Governments intent to receive at a minimum of three (3) past performances for the team? No, it is intent to received a minimum of three (3) for the prime and a minimum three (3) for the sub.

(2) Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 11.  The question was asked about what page margins, font types and sizes a contractor should utilize when formatting the proposal.  Your response was 5 inch margins, 12 pitch, Times New Roman is preferred.   Can you please clarify?   Can a contractor use 11 pitch Times New Roman and 1 inch margins and still be within the formatting guidelines of the Solicitation Requirements.  5 inch margins that were listed is administratively incorrect and is deleted and replaced with 1 inch margins, but the 12 pitch, Times New Roman is as stated.

(3)  Per Modification #4 of Solicitation #SAQMPD05R1006, Question 19.  Can the government please clarify their response to the questions asked?   The Government answers yes to the fact that they are only expecting an hourly rate and estimated hours for 1 Full Time Employee per labor category.  Then the government advises that contractor should propose costs/prices for the base and each option year?   From this verbiage are the contractors suppose to bid only labor categories as one full time employee and then escalate them out through the option years. Does the government want the proposed staffing as offered in the solicitation to be disregarded in this price quote?  Is the government only looking for labor rates for this solicitation? On the other hand, is the government looking for a price quote for labor rates and the proposed staffing that was given in the solicitation?  Question and Answer for 19 was posted as:   19.  For pricing proposal, is the government looking for hour rates/estimated hours for one full-time equivalent under each labor category?     Yes..Or, are we expected to estimated the number of total hours for the entire contract under each labor category?     Yes, the contractor should proposed costs/prices for the base and each option year.  Therefore, what the government has clearly stated that proposals received are expected to include price/cost for the base period and all option years that include the total amount of hours.  Meanwhile it is totally up to the contractors how they submit their proposals.

All else remains unchanged.

I.12	52.219-18  Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Concerns (June 2003)

<DESC>BACKGROUND. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the Department of Defense (DoD) needs to identify Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems that are capable of saving the lives of our Coalition and Partner Nation soldiers who are exposed to Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats when performing their duties.  This announcement invites industry to participate in a Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) market survey.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to identify technically mature Mounted CREW systems that could potentially satisfy the performance and suitability CREW system requirements of Coalition and Partner Nation military forces. OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS. It is expected that potential systems will be an electronic units that are designed to emit a programmable RF signal with the purpose of defeating a RCIED threat.  These CREW systems must be effective against a variety of known specific RCIED threats as well as potentially effective against future and even not yet undefined RCIED threats.  Thus, there is a requirement for a high level of programmability (threat-specific software algorithms).  This survey is intended to specifically investigate Vehicle Mounted CREW Systems for possible deployment in a variety of vehicles (both military and commercial).  Systems already in use by the U.S. Government should not be submitted for this study. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. These general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:   a)	The proposed system can not be one that is already in use by the U.S. Government for the protection of U.S. military personnel b)	Be designed to support rapid field reprogramming to address emerging threats c)	Be capable of being programmed to meet ECM operational requirements by a designated and trained individual d)	Be designed to minimize interference with Blue Force communications and other operating systems e)	Be capable of using a software determined timing protocol f)	Have an embedded GPS capability or capable of receiving a GPS input (include also the length of time accuracy is maintained after the loss of GPS or a GPS malfunction) g)	Have a minimum operational reliability of 90% with a MTBF of at least 790 hours, and a minimum availability of 0.85 h)	Size, weight, volume, form and fit should have a minimal impact on the function and performance of the military vehicle/platform in which it is carried; i)	Address threat signals at operationally effective distances j)	Be capable of effectively addressing multiple threats k)	Have antenna and mounting components that are designed to minimize degradation of overall operational effectiveness l)	Have the ability to be programmable from a standard operator-supplied personal computer with government or vendor non-proprietary software that can support government proprietary and threat-specific algorithms downloaded into the unit m)	Have an effective and comprehensive range of anti-tamper and zeroize capability, both automatic and manual. RESPONSES.  Responses may be submitted in any format, however electronic submissions are preferred.  Responses must include the: .	System description .	Performance specifications and parameters .	Overall capabilities of the system(s) as compared against the above general requirements .	All possible power sources that the system is capable of using .	Technology readiness level (TRL) of the system with justification .	Additional detailed information regarding the system capabilities/performance (prior testing, test reports, etc.) .	Description of logistics, training and maintenance requirements for the system .	Estimated system unit cost in production quantities of 50, 2000, 500, 1000, and 5000 .	Estimated production rates including lead time and associated ramp up rates for production quantities of 50, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 .	Estimated cost and schedule for assembly and delivery of: (a) three (3) test articles and; (b) five (5) test articles of production representative quality and function .

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Resource Management, Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (INL/RM/AIJS).
The incumbent serves as a Project Coordinator/Government Technical Monitor and is responsible for determining project needs, defining project goals and developing project work plans for myriad multifaceted overseas projects for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) present and future post conflict multi-billion dollar programs in civilian police training and elsewhere as assigned.  He/she works closely with a team of professionals, both Bureau and contract employees, assigned to a project from inception through completion.  The team carries out the full range of responsibilities related to the project, i.e., security, maintenance, safety and fire protection, design and construction. Provides guidance and technical leadership to ensure efficiency and economy of operations, including appropriate use of materials and expenditure of financial resources.  

Because of the sources of INL?s funding and its requirement to respond rapidly to emerging geopolitical needs, the Bureau?s authorities have been tasked to accomplish emergency post conflict tasks after armed conflict arises in a particular country or region.  The increasing regularity of these post conflict needs over the past several years has created the need for the Bureau to establish a separate office to conduct contract and infrastructure development and execution activities for existing and new post conflict-related programs, such as (re)training indigenous civilian police.  Establishing this division with its requisite staffing will allow the Bureau to act quickly and in a proactive manner to address high profile post conflict areas of the world, and offers the bureau the ability to better align resources for future projects before those needs arrive suddenly and impact existing operational staff.  To successfully manage current and future multi-billion dollar, fast breaking post conflict programs, the Bureau must have staff dedicated not only to the development and implementation of existing and future programs but, of equal importance, to constantly monitoring the inherent financial and contract requirements fueling these programs. The formulation of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (AIJS) affords INL the means to manage these financial and contract functions by coordinating all aspects of the project and supporting and interfacing with the relevant entities within the Bureau (CIVPOL, AP, RM), as well as with the regional Bureau(s) and Embassies, interagency working groups, and appropriate elements within the Departments of Defense and Justice, and elsewhere.  

The Division is comprised of a group of seasoned professionals with expertise in the administrative, construction, contract, and financial management fields, who will serve on specific project teams, either in a coordination role in Washington and/or overseas, e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Dubai, or elsewhere, where they will be required to monitor individual country projects.  The AIJS staff works closely with the Bureau?s program managers and specialists responsible for developing and implementing the INL-related programs, e.g., police training, eradication, etc., and with contractors and Embassy staff and other agency personnel assigned overseas.  

The project teams are responsible for managing all contract related phases of the programs related to the construction of buildings and related sanitary facilities overseas; developing and implementing security requirements for INL?s hostile operating environments; handling contract and financial management activities that are unrelated to the Bureau?s actual police or eradication work; coordinating contract document reviews, determining how to best review detailed contractor invoice criteria, and verifying INL assets purchased.  This optimizes INL?s accountability on these high visibility programs.

The position is under the supervision of the Chief of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Resource Management, Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (INL/RM/AIJS).
The incumbent serves as a Project Coordinator/Government Technical Monitor and is responsible for determining project needs, defining project goals and developing project work plans for myriad multifaceted overseas projects for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) present and future post conflict multi-billion dollar programs in civilian police training and elsewhere as assigned.  He/she works closely with a team of professionals, both Bureau and contract employees, assigned to a project from inception through completion.  The team carries out the full range of responsibilities related to the project, i.e., security, maintenance, safety and fire protection, design and construction. Provides guidance and technical leadership to ensure efficiency and economy of operations, including appropriate use of materials and expenditure of financial resources.  

Because of the sources of INL?s funding and its requirement to respond rapidly to emerging geopolitical needs, the Bureau?s authorities have been tasked to accomplish emergency post conflict tasks after armed conflict arises in a particular country or region.  The increasing regularity of these post conflict needs over the past several years has created the need for the Bureau to establish a separate office to conduct contract and infrastructure development and execution activities for existing and new post conflict-related programs, such as (re)training indigenous civilian police.  Establishing this division with its requisite staffing will allow the Bureau to act quickly and in a proactive manner to address high profile post conflict areas of the world, and offers the bureau the ability to better align resources for future projects before those needs arrive suddenly and impact existing operational staff.  To successfully manage current and future multi-billion dollar, fast breaking post conflict programs, the Bureau must have staff dedicated not only to the development and implementation of existing and future programs but, of equal importance, to constantly monitoring the inherent financial and contract requirements fueling these programs. The formulation of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (AIJS) affords INL the means to manage these financial and contract functions by coordinating all aspects of the project and supporting and interfacing with the relevant entities within the Bureau (CIVPOL, AP, RM), as well as with the regional Bureau(s) and Embassies, interagency working groups, and appropriate elements within the Departments of Defense and Justice, and elsewhere.  

The Division is comprised of a group of seasoned professionals with expertise in the administrative, construction, contract, and financial management fields, who will serve on specific project teams, either in a coordination role in Washington and/or overseas, e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Dubai, or elsewhere, where they will be required to monitor individual country projects.  The AIJS staff works closely with the Bureau?s program managers and specialists responsible for developing and implementing the INL-related programs, e.g., police training, eradication, etc., and with contractors and Embassy staff and other agency personnel assigned overseas.  

The project teams are responsible for managing all contract related phases of the programs related to the construction of buildings and related sanitary facilities overseas; developing and implementing security requirements for INL?s hostile operating environments; handling contract and financial management activities that are unrelated to the Bureau?s actual police or eradication work; coordinating contract document reviews, determining how to best review detailed contractor invoice criteria, and verifying INL assets purchased.  This optimizes INL?s accountability on these high visibility programs.

The position is under the supervision of the Chief of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division.

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Resource Management, Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (INL/RM/AIJS).

The incumbent serves as a Project Coordinator/In-Country COR and is responsible for determining project needs, defining project goals and developing project work plans for myriad multifaceted overseas projects for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) present and future post conflict multi-billion dollar programs in civilian police training and elsewhere as assigned.  He/she works closely with a team of professionals, both Bureau and contract employees, assigned to a project from inception through completion.  The team carries out the full range of responsibilities related to the project, i.e., security, maintenance, safety and fire protection, design and construction. Provides guidance and technical leadership to ensure efficiency and economy of operations, including appropriate use of materials and expenditure of financial resources.  

Because of the sources of INL?s funding and its requirement to respond rapidly to emerging geopolitical needs, the Bureau?s authorities have been tasked to accomplish emergency post conflict tasks after armed conflict arises in a particular country or region.  The increasing regularity of these post conflict needs over the past several years has created the need for the Bureau to establish a separate office to conduct contract and infrastructure development and execution activities for existing and new post conflict-related programs, such as (re)training indigenous civilian police.  Establishing this division with its requisite staffing will allow the Bureau to act quickly and in a proactive manner to address high profile post conflict areas of the world, and offers the bureau the ability to better align resources for future projects before those needs arrive suddenly and impact existing operational staff.  To successfully manage current and future multi-billion dollar, fast breaking post conflict programs, the Bureau must have staff dedicated not only to the development and implementation of existing and future programs but, of equal importance, to constantly monitoring the inherent financial and contract requirements fueling these programs. The formulation of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division (AIJS) affords INL the means to manage these financial and contract functions by coordinating all aspects of the project and supporting and interfacing with the relevant entities within the Bureau (CIVPOL, AP, RM), as well as with the regional Bureau(s) and Embassies, interagency working groups, and appropriate elements within the Departments of Defense and Justice, and elsewhere.  

The Division is comprised of a group of seasoned professionals with expertise in the administrative, construction, contract, and financial management fields, who will serve on specific project teams, either in a coordination role in Washington and/or overseas, e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Dubai, or elsewhere, where they will be required to monitor individual country projects.  The AIJS staff works closely with the Bureau?s program managers and specialists responsible for developing and implementing the INL-related programs, e.g., police training, eradication, etc., and with contractors and Embassy staff and other agency personnel assigned overseas.  

The project teams are responsible for managing all contract related phases of the programs related to the construction of buildings and related sanitary facilities overseas; developing and implementing security requirements for INL?s hostile operating environments; handling contract and financial management activities that are unrelated to the Bureau?s actual police or eradication work; coordinating contract document reviews, determining how to best review detailed contractor invoice criteria, and verifying INL assets purchased.  This optimizes INL?s accountability on these high visibility programs.

The position is under the supervision of the Chief of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan Support Division.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the project management field, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service.

?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, policies, regulations and procedures, including U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.

IV. Contract Provisions

?	Security clearance at the Top-Secret level.
?	The contract period should be for one year with options to extend for additional years, not to exceed five years.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing Light Weight (LW) 30MM M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge, NSN 1305-01-268-9373, Part No. 12902728.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges. The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body, fuze, and copper liner metal parts, (2) fuze production, (3) production of propellant, (4) cartridge case priming and loading  with propellant  and (5) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Experience in ba llistic testing, expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, and process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistics test range, M230 MANN barrels and M230 Automatic Gun are required t o perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate  systems, ultrasonic test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of the cartridge is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition process/design engineers, explo sive experts, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control engineers, ultra sonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test personnel, etc) needed to  manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, the producers must be able to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test within seven months after aw ard, with the first production delivery due within nine months after award.  A respondents production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture an average of 50,000 per month.  The technical Data Package (TDP) associated with the LW30mm M789 HEDP cartrid ge is coded Distribution X, which means distribution is authorized to U.S. Government agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technical data in accordance with regulations implementing 10 USC 140C.  To receive t he TDP, all interested contractors must have a current approved DD Form 2345 on file at the defense logistics service center HTTP://www.dlis.mil/jcp/.  Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the M789 cartridge are invited  to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companys capabilities, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience to: HQ, ASC, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-F/Amy VanSickle, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-650 0.  Please respond no later than 19 October 2006 and identity the 30MM M789 Source Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an oblig ation on the part of the Government.

Direct and low contrast data matrix marks are produced by a variety of processes on items of various materials and shapes and are subject to degradation over time due to exposure to the environment and norm al wear and tear.  Such marks present varied levels of technical difficulty in reading and decoding.    The PM J-AIT seeks from industry descriptions of use cases involving low contrast and direct data matrix markings encountered in industry facilities that constitute use cases that Department of Defense (DoD) customers might encounter.  A combination of a m ark and a reading environment constitutes a use case The PM J-AIT also seeks vendors of area imagers capable of reading low contrast and directly marked ECC-200 data matrix symbols who are interested in demonstrating their products on a variety of use cases involving low contrast and direct data matrix marks .   The PM J-AIT will host structured demonstrations of commercial area imaging devices.  Use cases will be replicated at the PM J-AIT facility in Tobyhanna, PA, and equipment vendors will conduct demonstrations under controlled conditions.  Such demonstrations are tentatively planned for the mid-November through mid-December 2006 timeframe.  T he results of the demonstrations will be disseminated within the DoD.

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Scott AFB, Illinois, as the DOD?s Distribution Process Owner (DPO), covering the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), is soliciting proposals for innovative and transformational research and development of new joint concepts, prototypes, and studies, demonstrations, and experiments on technologies with strong potential to increase the responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness of DOD joint distribution and transportation operations, in support of the full spectrum of joint global military operations.  Funding for these efforts will commence with receipt of USTRANSCOM Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funds.   

The Top Four Operational Challenges (Attachment 1) and the DPO Capability Gaps and Process Opportunities (Attachment 2) describe priority needs of the DOD distribution system.  Proposals addressing the Operational Challenges and the higher DPO Capability priorities will be given greater consideration during the Government?s selection process.  However, proposals addressing lower-ranked gaps may also be considered if they possess many of the other suitability characteristics listed below.

Proposals should specify single- or multi-year efforts suitable for DOD Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding, beginning in FY08.  Proposals should clearly describe the intended level of technological maturity at project start and end using the Technology Readiness Level descriptions at Attachment 3.

In recognition that customer-identified ?requirements pull? needs are not the sole driver of innovation, offerors may choose to submit wholly new technology concepts for consideration; however, such ?technology push? proposals must convincingly show how further development can be expected to reveal a new, scientifically sound, and practical approach to fulfilling the DPO gaps.

Offerors may submit proposals for multi-year programs of research and development  focused on exploration of capabilities for the DPO gap areas listed below.  If multi-year/multi-project efforts are proposed, offerors should identify a baseline project, (including, if appropriate, a start-up scientifically/engineering-based study) with optional follow-on efforts to be selected by the Government, based on the Government?s assessment of the success of earlier segments, continued interest in proposed capability, and the availability of funding.

Offerors may also submit project-level efforts for research and development of individual applications, techniques, procedures, or tools to address a specific need.  Examples include investigating the feasibility of applying a commercially-available technology to a specific DOD distribution need.

The offeror must describe how these programs or projects, if executed, will prove the feasibility of addressing the DPO gaps and show positive return on investment of the selected concept. 

At the discretion of the Government, follow-on efforts may be selected to more fully develop or acquire/integrate the capability or tool into DOD distribution operations.

Proposals most likely to be chosen by the government will demonstrate a significant number of these suitability characteristics.  

- Addressing joint warfighting capability needs, enhancing DOD operations requiring situational awareness and synchronization of multiple Service/Agency organizations (not Service-specific capability or end-items);

- Focused on highest-priority DPO gaps;

- Enhancing performance of the distribution system (its reliability, responsiveness, efficiency, flexibility, visibility, security) in service to multiple distribution customers;

- Demonstrating an excellent understanding of the state-of-the-art of the chosen technology and an equally strong understanding of DOD/USTRANSCOM operations and shortfalls in capability;

- Utilizing or studying technology starting between Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4 and 6 (a description of TRLs is at Attachment 3.)  Proposals will also describe the intended ending TRL and a proposed System of Record in which the new capability will be integrated.

- Delivering a significant positive Return on Investment, if put into use

This is a two-phase selection process.  Phase I requires submittal of a white paper.  This white paper is intended to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to USTRANSCOM.  USTRANSCOM will evaluate the white papers against the evaluation criteria stated in this announcement and determine which white papers to pursue based on their applicability and consistency with the intent of the BAA.   Under Phase II, selected offerors will be requested to complete a definitive technical and cost proposal for USTRANSCOM to evaluate.

Evaluation of white papers will be performed using the project selection criteria in Attachment 4.   No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers.  Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA.  White papers submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR Parts 3.104-5 and 15.207.  

Government personnel will perform the evaluation of white papers and any selected technical/cost proposal.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors (primarily MITRE, Stanley, SRA, and LMI) may be utilized as subject-matter experts/technical consultants.   However, white paper selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel.  Each support contractor?s employee having access to white papers submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any white paper submissions.  Offerors are advised that only contracting officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal under this BAA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among these entities. 

Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Complete instructions for cost proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.

If an offerors? conference is required to facilitate the prioritization/selection process, a separate announcement will be issued.  At this time the government does not plan an offerors? conference. 

Total funding available for this BAA is approximately $6-10M for FY08 and $15-20M per year for FY09-FY13.  Typical projects in the RDT&E portfolio are in the $2-5M range. Awards may take the form of procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as appropriate.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, none, or part of the proposals received under this BAA and to award without discussions.  The Government provides no funding for direct reimbursement of white paper or proposal development costs.

This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  

Offerors are required to submit an original copy white paper on their UNCLASSIFIED proposed research topic to:  HQ AMC/A3KSA, 402 Scott Dr, Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL  62225-5302, Attn:  Tamara Schuette.  An electronic copy shall be submitted to Tamara.Schuette@scott.af.mil.  The white paper shall be formatted in accordance with Attachment 5 and shall be submitted by close of business 24 Oct 2006.  

Organizational conflict of interest issues will be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Offerors who have existing contracts under similar technical areas with USTC will receive particular scrutiny.  All potential conflicts must be disclosed and resolved.

If the offeror seeks to submit a classified proposal, please first contact the technical representative, Mr. Lou Bernstein, at address listed above, for electronic and hardcopy submittal instructions.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors must mark their white papers with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  

Full proposals (only for successful offerors of white papers as notified by the government) shall be submitted by close of business 22 Nov 2006.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for a Fine Particle Analyzer with the following specifications: Requirements:  A particle shape and size analyzer is required to measure and analyze the shape and size statistics for dry powders and dry soil consisting of fine particles.  These powders will include simulated lunar soil and cryogenic insulation powder.  The system must use optical methods to capture images of the particles and then perform analysis of the actual 2D images.  The system must photograph and catalog very large numbers of individual particles at high speed (10s or 100s of thousands of particles per work shift).  The system must continuously feed the particles into the imaging system automatically from a tray or hopper, and it must re-collect the material after it has passed in front of the imaging system.	(For example, a typical microscope-based system where the operator is required to prepare individual slides for the imager is not an acceptable system due to the high demands on the operator.)  It must be capable of analyzing particles between 2 and 1000 microns in diameter.  The system must include a dispersing unit capable of separating agglomerated particles smaller than 50 microns.  This disperser must consist of an air jet and vacuum system rather than a wet system, and it must be adjustable so that different powders with different cohesivity may be dispersed appropriately. As a minimum, the system must be capable of measuring and calculating the following parameters and statistics.  These must be obtained from the 2 dimensional images that were captured from the individual particles: Measured Parameters: Length; Thickness; Area; Perimeter; Calculated parameters: Aspect ratio (length to width); Shape factor (area to perimeter); Width based on elliptic estimate; Calculated distribution parameters: Size distribution by area diameter, perimeter diameter, length, thickness, or box size results weighted by number or volume; Percent non-spherical particles; Percent non spherical by size channel  volume or number distribution; Aspect ratio by size channel  volume or number distribution; Mean size, D10, D90, Dxx-, Dxx+; Uniformity index; This data must be tabulated and provided in electronic format on a computer-based system controller. Onsite installation and instructions must be included in the quote.

<DESC>Statement of Work-USCG Aviation Training Requirements 

1.0  Scope Of Work:  This Statement Of Work describes the vessel and personnel required to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami, FL.  The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard's aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting and fixed wing aerial delivery evolutions by Air Station aircraft. 

1.1  Background:  One of the Coast Guard's primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment to/from underway vessels, helicopter delivery/recovery of rescue swimmers to/from the water, and fixed wing aerial delivery of dewatering pumps and other equipment to the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guard's increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.  

1.2  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 38 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 11 foot beam.  The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet.  Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 10 tons. 

1.2.1  Other Characteristics:  The vessel must have an enclosed cabin large enough to accommodate the entire crew during transit.  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or "dead in the water".  The vessel must be capable of maintaining 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g. antennas).

1.2.2  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 64 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

1.2.3  Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, radar, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20 NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Miami Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

1.2.4  Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C. to 40 degrees C. (41 degrees F. to 105 degrees F.).  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

1.2.5  Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will also be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a one hour transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

1.2.6  Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturers technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and / or local regulations.

1.3  Personnel:  All contractor personnel are required to be U. S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.

1.3.1  Point Of Contact:  The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time.  The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

1.3.2  Crew:  Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands.  The crew shall be currently trained in rescue techniques and water survival.  Each of the crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and for aerial delivery equipment pickup as well as any required rescue operations.

1.3.2.1  Coxswain:  The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.  

1.3.2.2  Deckhands: The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

1.4  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:

Operations will typically be conducted for on scene periods of 3 hours commencing 1-2 hours prior to official sunset.  The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  Additional training periods may be conducted more than once a week to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

1.4.2  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be the shoreline out to 15 nautical miles from one of the following inlets: Port Everglades, Bakers Haulover or Government Cut.  The specific inlet will be determined by the contractor at the commencement of the contract and may be changed by the contractor with two weeks prior notification to the COTR.

1.4.3  Operational Log:   The contractor shall maintain a log of all operations, which includes dates, location, times, duration and type of evolutions being performed.  The log shall be passed to Air Station Miami COTR on a monthly basis within 5 days of the end of the month.

1.4.4  Communications during Operations:  The contractor shall ensure that the vessel contacts an appropriate U.S. Coast Guard communication facility at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes while engaged in aviation training services.

1.4.5  Weather Criteria:  The Vessel must be capable of completing training requirements in sea states of up to 4 feet and wind speeds of up to 30 knots.

1.4.6  Functions / Tasks:  The contractor shall support training operations for the hoisting and/or deployment of equipment from government aircraft.  These objects may be delivered directly to the contract vessel or dropped into the water for retrieval.  The contractor shall also serve as an on scene search and rescue asset during helicopter rescue swimmer deployment evolutions and helicopter approaches to the water.  The training to be conducted will be both initial for new aviators/aircrews and proficiency maintenance for experienced aviators/aircrews.

1.5  Performance Evaluation Meetings:  The contractor's project manager shall meet at least biweekly with the Contracting Officer, COTR or QAE during the first two months of the contract to discuss performance problems and review contractor corrective actions.  The operational log will also be used to verify the contractor?s timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a deduction in the charter hire.   Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR or QAE. 

1.6  Communication Procedures:  The government shall provide/assign VHF communication frequencies for contractor use.  The contractor shall provide a cell phone on board for secondary communications with the Air Station Miami Operations Center. 

1.7  Orientation Briefing & Training:  The government shall provide an orientation brief and initial training for key contract personnel prior to the contract start date.  The orientation and training will include at a minimum safe boating practices, vessel hoisting operations, rescue swimmer operations, dewatering pump delivery operations, etc.  The government shall also provide semi-annual refresher training on the same items.

1.8  Invoicing for Service:  A set payment will be established for a standard training block.  The payment will be the same regardless of whether the Coast Guard actually uses the full scheduled time.  The standard training block will include three hours of contract vessel on scene time, not including transit time to/from the training site from the contractor's mooring/docking location.  Scheduled unused training time may be banked by the Air Station and added onto any future training block.  No training block shall exceed six hours.  Unused training time may not be used to set up a separate trip.  Any unused training time at the end of the contract will be forfeited.
