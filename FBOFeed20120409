<DESC>The Army intends to issue a competitive 8(a) solicitation for explosive decontamination/disposal, disassembly and inspection of real and personal property, sub-foundation testing/disposal, and documentation preparation for the NC Area #2 at Indiana Army Ammunition Plant (INAAP), Charlestown, Indiana.<br><br>This project consists of inspection and explosives decontamination of buildings, equipment and sub-foundation testing/disposal to include disassembly of suspected contaminated buildings and assorted equipment, off-site disposal of contaminated materials, and documentation preparation.<br><br>The objectives of this project are as follows:<br><br>Equipment Decontamination:  The buildings and equipment identified shall be decontaminated in accordance with DoD Manual 6055.09M and EM 385-1-97.  The contractor shall perform testing of residual material (post burn ash/soils) in support of appropriate off-site disposal IAW DoD 4140.62.<br><br>Facility Decontamination:  The buildings identified shall be decontaminated in accordance with DoD Manual 6055.09M and EM 385-1-97. Creosote wooden blast walls, and poured concrete structures such as; floor slabs, interior walls, sumps, and blast walls will not be demolished, but left in place.  Demolition activities will not adversely impact active work or operations.  Work shall be scheduled so interference with other efforts is minimized.  Adjacent facilities not part of this project shall be protected from damage and debris.  Any airborne debris will be controlled to prevent the spread of dust while avoiding the creation of a nuisance in surrounding areas.  The use of water to spray the site to reduce release of airborne particulate is permitted as required, but shall be controlled to ensure it does not create hazardous or objectionable conditions such as ice, flooding, excess run off, pollution, reaching a waterway or flowing into a sinkhole/karst feature.  The contractor shall not use the decontamination site for burning refuse. The contractor will certify and verify building and equipment debris as free of explosive hazards IAW <br>DoDI 4140.62 and EM 385-1-97. A video in Digital Video Disk (DVD) format showing all building burns shall be prepared and provided (5 Copies) as part of this task.<br><br>Cleanup: Soil disturbance will be kept to a minimum during pre/post decontamination as well as clean up.  Based on post decontamination testing results of the material/ash residue, proper handling, labeling, collection, shipment and disposal of the material will be conducted in support of off-site disposal IAW applicable Federal, state or local law or regulation. Upon removal/disposal of residual material, confirmation samples shall be tested as identified, to ensure no surface contamination resulted or remains as a direct result of the decontamination activities. In the event soil contamination exists, further delineation shall take place in order to determine the remaining soils that will require excavation and hauling for off-site disposal.  In lieu of further delineation, the contractor may choose to perform a risk assessment to determine the risk to human health and the environment that could preclude the dig/haul activities.  Disposal shall be accomplished at an approved offsite landfill or through an approved scrap dealer.  Hauling and disposal shall be performed IAW interstate statutes.  After sites have been visually inspected and equipment removal work is complete, the site will be graded to match the existing landscape and to allow for natural drainage.  The site will be seeded with grass to avoid erosion using 50-pound pure live seed/acre of fescue.  Material handling of asbestos/ash/scrap will be minimized.  Hot work permits will be required when performing hot work; such as welding, torch cutting, chop saws or any procedure that produces spark or flame. Copy of hot work permit to be provided to INAAP COR prior to commencement of the activity.<br><br>Foundation Testing/Post Burn Confirmation Samples:  The facilities, scheduled for inspection and decontamination, are also required to have sub-foundations tested for the presence of explosives.   A Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) will be required to support the foundation testing efforts. Provide a draft SAP to the Army for review/comment.  Revise the SAP and provide a Draft Final to the INAAP COR for submittal to IDEM.  Review/respond to IDEM's comments through the INAAP COR and finalize SAP within 30 days of IDEM's comments.  Intact foundations, slabs and blast walls of the facilities may remain, if structurally sound.  The contractor shall test for explosives presence along appendages, all cracks, floor drains, and footings at any point considered high risk, or at any point where natural or man-made drainage may have deposited residual explosives.  <br><br>Period of performance for this project will be 16 months after contract award.<br>

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks independently, but under Public Affairs supervision, direction, and control:<br><br>a.	The contractor must provide photographers who can immediately undertake 	 the management, administration, and technical services of the photography required for performance within the MCoE Public Affairs Office at Fort Benning.    <br><br>b.	All photographers employed by the Contractor to perform services under this contract agreement, should have at least three (3) years of professional photography experience and should be knowledgeable in the use and application of Adobe for photographers, Photo Shop, and Freehand. Photographers would have such assigned tasks as taking group photos of visiting dignitaries and adding the command logo and visit information to the image before printing copies for presentation, or going up in a helicopter to photograph the commanding general or other VIPs and capturing the best images from the Maneuver Conference or the Best Ranger Competition, where time is of the essence and he/she must move from place to place quickly.  The photographer will be relied on at times to help out with selection, in capturing the correct shot for publication. <br><br>1.  VIP visits can require total coverage from the beginning to the end of the visit.  On average, there are between 4 and 6 of these events each month.  During these events, not only will the contractor be required to provide dedicated photo coverage for the visiting dignitary, he/she will also be required to cover mission-related events of a routine and special nature simultaneously.  <br><br>2.  Often, the contractor will be required to print a selection of images for VIPs prior to their departure.  Photo coverage must be able to continue while these office duties are taking place. The contractor is required to keep a professional archive of all images produced on the online photo site, www.FortBenningPhotos.com - which includes the appropriate cutline information for each photograph.  <br><br>c.

The contractor is required to cover between 18 and 22 events of this nature per 		month.  These events can be scheduled or last-minute in nature, so the contractor 	must be prepared to provide simultaneous coverage in the event of multiple 	activities conflicting.  The contractor is required to archive all photos from events covered online, including a detailed cutline for each image uploaded to the photo site.<br><br>2.  The contractor is required to take group photos, which will often involve set up of lights and other photographic equipment.  There are between 8 and 12 requirements for group photos per month and the contractor must maintain the ability to cover events that may be scheduled during these group photos.	<br><br>d.	The Contractor must be responsible for providing management and guidance related to capturing critical photographs in various environments and situations while also organizing and archiving past/present and future photographs. During assignments, photographers must work independently of any direct supervision and with extreme discretion due the sensitive nature of the events to be captured. <br><br>e.	The contractor will provide cutline information for each photo taken including, but not limited to, name and contact information of any photographed individuals, locations and event information, including date and a detailed description of what's taking place in the photograph.  AP Style cutlines (minus the contact info) will be uploaded to the online archive with their corresponding image. <br><br>f.	The contractor is required to keep a professional archive of all images produced on the online photo site, www.FortBenningPhotos.com.  The contractor will make digital duplication of photographs for distribution as necessary and deliver to appropriate outlets/individuals in a timely manner.<br><br>g.	The contractor is charged with increasing positive awareness and appreciation of Fort Benning by seamlessly integrating and promoting command photography with various websites and social media outlets.   The contractor will provide photo support including, but not limited to, photo searches, photo editing and photo graphics to all Public Affairs products including The Bayonet, Fort Benning TV, Tip of the Bayonet Newsletter, www.FortBenningPhotos.com, the Fort Benning Social Media network and any Strategic Communication project including, but not limited to, posters and brochures. <br><br>h.	The contractor will serve as technical engineer for all assigned equipment and maintain equipment as needed.<br><br>i.	The contractor shall provide a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week emergency telephone number to provide immediate photography coverage or assistance as needed.<br><br>j.	The contractor, at no cost to the government, shall replace any equipment due to loss, negligence, or damage.<br><br>k.	The contractor must be able to work in various environments to include wooded areas, uneven terrains, and heights and may be required to shoot photos and video from a military aircraft.  Strenuous physical activity is often involved in covering Fort Benning events.  Contractor must be able to wear a military helmet and body armor that can weigh up to 40 pounds while covering some training events.   Hearing protection will be provided by the government during activities involving gunfire. <br><br>l.	The contractor must provide uninterrupted performance of the designated services which are known for such a position within the department of labor guidelines, however, due to the diversity of events, assignments, and command schedules, he/she will stand ready to support, regardless of location (in or out of state), weather (cold and hot outdoor/indoor temperatures), or complexity (possibly the need to pull additional photographers in to support special events). <br><br> <br>REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION OF INVOICES<br><br>C.6.1 Invoicing Schedule. Contractor shall establish billing cycle for all services provided under this contract, which runs from the 1st through the last day of the month.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Elastic Bandages on or about <strong>July 1, 2012</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to non-sterile and sterile, latex-free/safe, Velcro/self closure and clip closure Elastic Bandages in various widths and lengths: a) BANDAGE ELASTIC W/CLIPS REMOVABLE 6IN X 4-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, b) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 6IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, c) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 4IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, d) BANDAGE ELASTIC W/CLIPS REMOVABLE 4IN X 4.5-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, e) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 3IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, f) BANDAGE ELASTIC W/CLIPS REMOVABLE 3IN X 4-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, g) BANDAGE ELASTIC W/CLIPS REMOVABLE 6IN X 11YD OR NEAREST EQUIVALENT NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, h) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 2IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, i) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 6IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX STERILE, j) BANDAGE ELASTIC W/CLIPS REMOVABLE 2IN X 4.5-5.5 YD NON-LATEX NON-STERILE, k) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 4IN X 5.5YD NON-LATEX STERILE, l) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 4IN X 5YD NON-LATEX STERILE, m) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 3IN X 5YD NON-LATEX STERILE, n) BANDAGE ELASTIC 4IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX STERILE CLIP, o) BANDAGE ELASTIC SELF-CLOSURE 2IN X 5-5.5YD NON-LATEX STERILE, and other items. <br /><br />The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $1,300,000 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) for the purchase of services under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The requirement is based on NIST's need for:</p>
<p>The National Institute of standards is working to fix the value of the Planck constant using an experiment known as a watt balance. This experiment requires the use of a test object known as K85, the precise mass of which must be determined with respect to the international standard kilogram with the highest level of certainty possible, or the experiment will not succeed. Because mass, by international definition, is measured by comparison to an artifact located at the BIPM in Paris, the only way to obtain the most precise determination of the mass of a test object is to ship the item to Paris and have the BIPM perform this determination. This is the only way that NIST can obtain a calibration of mass that is better than its own. Furthermore, because the NIST watt balance experiment operates in a vacuum, it is necessary to determine the mass of this test object in a similar vacuum condition. This determination requires a vacuum to air characterization and additional calibrations of the volume of various test objects that can, again, only be determined at the BIPM with the level of accuracy required for the experiment to succeed. Therefore, because the necessary services for the determination of these volumes and masses are only available at the BIPM, NIST intends to negotiate with the BIPM on a sole source basis for the following:</p>
<p>1) Volume determination of the stack of disks C18 by hydrostatic weighing method. <br />2) Air-vacuum characterization of the stack of disks C18 by gravimetry method (air-vacuum-air-vacuum-air sequence). Air (at atmospheric pressure around 50% of relative humidity) and vacuum around 2 mPa.<br />3) Air-vacuum characterization of the prototype K85 by gravimetry method (air-vacuum-air-vacuum-air sequence). Air (at atmospheric pressure around 50% of relative humidity) and vacuum around 2 mPa.</p>
<p>BIPM is the only source that offers precise determination of the mass of a test object system that meets all of NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on April 23, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Stanford Research Systems (SRS) for the purchase of impedance measurement and analysis equipment under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The NIST Farad and Impedance Metrology (FIM) Project presently uses SR850 and DS360 instruments, manufactured by SRS, in several measurement systems. Control software for these instruments has already been developed by NIST and error analyses have already been undertaken for determination of uncertainty budgets for the systems employing these instruments. Purchasing similar instruments from other manufacturers would require months of work for several staff members for the programming of the instruments and additional months of work to carry out the error analysis to produce uncertainty budgets. The initiative driving the need for these instruments commissions FIM Project to modernize the impedance measurement systems and so the additional instruments (SR650, SG386, SR1, SIM900, CIS300, and PPM100) will be integrated with the SR850 and DS360 instruments of projects other systems to produce the developmental tools and components for the new NIST Calculable Capacitor, which is presently under development. Using Stanford Research Systems, the same manufacturer, will save months of labor in the integration of these instruments into the control programs governing our complex system.</p>
<p>The items below will be used to support the modernization of the NIST impedance measurement systems, including the new NIST Calculable Capacitor, audio frequency capacitance and inductance measurement systems, and inductive voltage divider measurement system. These components will provide the capability to generate, detect, evaluate, and troubleshoot some of the electrical and mechanical processes used with these NIST measurement systems.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the necessary equipment is only available at the SRS, NIST intends to negotiate with the SRS on a sole source basis for the following:</p>
<p><br />3 x SR850 DSP Dual Phase Lock-In Amplifier<br />3 x DS360 Low Distortion Function Generator<br />1 x SR650 Programmable Filter<br />1 x SG386/01/02/02 RF Signal Generator<br />1 x SR1/123 Audio Analyzer<br />1 x SIM900/1 Mainframe Instrumentation Module<br />5 x SIM960 Analog PID Controller<br />1 x CIS300/2 Closed Ion Source Gas Analyzer<br />1 x Turbomolecular pump and diaphragm pump<br />1 x PPM100 Partial Pressure Monitor for RGA</p>
<p>SRS is the only source that offers Impedance Measurement and Analysis Equipment<br />that meets all of NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Affymetrix, 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, for a maintenance and service agreement for a government-owned Affymetrix Fluidic Station.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 the business size standard is $19.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory Unit (MELU) in the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is dedicated to studying genetic determinants of upper gastrointestinal cancer as part of a global effort to develop strategies for the prevention of these cancers. Efforts in the MELU are focused on gene discovery for genetic susceptibility and early detection marker identification, as well as laboratory analysis in traditional epidemiologic association studies.</p>
<p>The MELU houses a government-owned Affymetrix Fluidic Station (serial numbers 60101670, 60114350, FS0259) which includes a CPU (serial number 57VJPL1), hybridization oven (serial number 11845), autoloader (serial number A06590), and genechip scanner (serial number 54713480). This system is the major analytic platform used in the MELU for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and expression array chips. The NCI proposes to purchase a service maintenance agreement for this Fluidic Station.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) One (1) preventive maintenance inspection per year; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty eight (48) hours of first call; 3) all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries at no additional cost to the Government; 4) software service and updates in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures.

This system must provide high resolution; expanded fluorescence capability; speed and ease of use; and quality image capture, processing, and storage capabilities. The Zeiss LSM 780 Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and Environmental Chamber will best meet all of NCI's specifications in one integrated system.</p>
<p>This new confocal system must be compatible with NCI's existing equipment. As all of the current equipment is Zeiss, and PC-based, NCI must be able to network this new system to other computers and printers in the laboratory, thus allowing for easy image transfer and/or printing. NCI must be able to interchange parts, such as the PLAN APO objectives, if necessary. User training and implementation of the new system shall be rapid, minimizing any "down time." And this system must also be upgraded relatively easily and inexpensively in the future to add new capabilities as needed.</p>
<p>NCI will be able to add this new confocal system to the existing discounted Zeiss preventive maintenance/service contract after the warranty expires, providing additional savings to the laboratory and the NCI in subsequent years.</p>
<p>Because the Zeiss LSM 780 Confocal Microscope with Scanning Stage and Environmental Chamber has unique features not available from other known companies, is compatible with existing equipment, and will potentially yield additional savings to the laboratory and NCI in the future, it is the only known instrument able to meet the needs of NCI.<br /><br />The salient characteristics of the Zeiss LSM 780 system include:</p>

The program concept embraces open-architecture methodology to expand sensor performance through the use of common software components to achieve cost effectiveness and system efficiency.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) systems are comprised of integrated subsystems that provide USW search, detection, classification, and localization for surface ships in both littoral and open ocean environments.   AN/SQQ-89(V) variants provide major capability improvements through hardware and software upgrades using an Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process.
  

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

There are no other commercially available software packages that will allow these models to be used in their present form. A complete statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). RFQ issuance will be on or about April 24, 2012. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 423430 and the small business size standard is 100 Employees.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only. The US Army Contracting Command  New Jersey at Fort Dix is conducting market research for a System Integrator to develop and implement Increment II of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System  Army (IPPS-A). The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's Increment II System Integrator requirements. IPPS-A is designated a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program under the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO). IPPS-A is a pre-Major Automated Information System (pre-MAIS) and a Defense Business System (DBS) program. It is managed by the Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), IPPS-A Project Management Office, in Alexandria, VA 22332. The purpose of the IPPS-A System Integrator contract is to obtain contractor services for the design, development, integration, testing, implementation, and deployment of a PeopleSoft Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, which integrates Army Business Processes and existing Army data into a single Human Resource and pay system.
Statement of Need:IPPS-A will provide integrated personnel and pay management for all components (Active, Guard and Reserve). IPPS-A will be a web-based tool, developed through the use of a COTS ERP product, available 24 hours a day, accessible to soldiers, (HR professionals, Combatant Commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army. The Army is developing IPPS-A using a hybrid solution that includes the use of PeopleSoft ERP software, third party products, and Agile Development to deliver integrated personnel and pay capabilities. IPPS-A is being developed in two Increments with multiple releases. Increment I, currently in development, will provide a single, multi-Component trusted database with reporting capabilities that will provide a single record for all Army Soldiers. Increment I will serve as a trusted data source for personnel and human resources data for the entire Army, allow for interface communications, and produce multi-Component reports. Increment I will provide the system infrastructure necessary to build Increment II and future releases.
Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database and PeopleSoft foundation delivered by IPPS-A Increment I. IPPS-A Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. The Army will employ incremental development for Increment II, developing capabilities in 14-18 month cycles, with fielding of capabilities every 12 months. Total system functionality will be delivered across four releases: personnel accountability, including a Soldier self-service module (Release 2.0), essential personnel services (Release 3.0), pay services, including automated pay actions (Release 4.0), and remaining personnel services (Release 5.0). Each release of IPPS-A will incrementally build upon the prior releases design and capability. 
The Army will use the Army PeopleSoft 9.1 ERP and Oracle 11g database capabilities developed in Increment I, along with Application Technologies outside of the core, to meet user requirements for the total system. The IPPS-A PMO fully expects the incoming System Integrator to apply patches, bundles, and feature packs to upgrade any existing custom software prior to Increment II development. In addition, if major application releases (e.g., PeopleSoft 9.2) are generally available prior to major development activities for each IPPS-A release, the System Integrator will be expected to analyze the feasibility of applying a major application upgrade, and subsequently execute the upgrade if directed by the Government.
The Army seeks to engage a contract System Integrator for the total development and implementation of IPPS-A Increment II, from the transition of fielding support for Increment I through development of Increment II, Releases 2-5, until attainment of Full Deployment (FD) and transition to a post-deployment sustainment support contractor. The anticipated scope of the work shall include:	Program Management	Information Assurance	Application Security	Systems Engineering	Technical Architecture	Software Configuration and Development	System Integration	Data Management and Data Migration	Environment Development and Management	Disaster Recovery	Design Reviews	Life-Cycle Management	Integrated Logistics Support	Test and Evaluation	Classified Products Support	Transition
Prospective IPPS-A System Integrator contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in the disciplines listed above in order to meet the programs requirements. Prospective contractors shall also demonstrate experience in ERP implementation, Agile and modular development, and incorporation of inventive and evolving technologies in a cost-effective and proficient manner that will advance its performance and support to the IPPS-A project. The prospective contractor shall also have knowledge of Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Human Resources and Army Pay Systems, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) processes and operations. In addition to these standards, the IPPS-A system and data must be compliant with the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) and follow Common Human Resources Information Standards (CHRIS) from design through sustainment. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) has been attached to this notice for a more specific description of the type of services that may be required.
Capability Statement:An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Governments requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing large ERP implementation projects and government contracts of the same or similar nature, experience implementing the products identified above, and ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, tasks, e.g., through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc. The statement shall include the sources website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only); business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. The client reference must be for work relevant to this requirement performed within the last three years and include the agency supported, a client point of contact, whether the work was performed as a prime or a subcontractor, delivery date or period of performance, and a brief description of the effort. This statement shall not exceed 10 pages. The page limit does not apply to advertising material such as company brochures and catalogs.
This information will be used for market research and analysis to determine what capabilities currently exist. This notice should NOT be construed as a request for proposal or any obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. No award will be made from this announcement. No telephone calls and/or request for solicitation information will be accepted or acknowledged. 
Interested parties ARE REQUIRED to provide contractor name, address, and information regarding any Government contracts that they may hold such as the Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) contract vehicle or General Services Administration (GSA) multiple awards schedule (MAS) that may satisfy this potential requirement.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) forEnterprise Solutions for Datacenter Hardware, Software and Services
Sources Sought Number W15QKN-12-X-H009

Note:  This Request for Information (RFI) replaces RFI Sources Sought Number W15QKN-12-X-H007, dated 27 March 2012.
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.
This RFI is being used to gather market research to make decisions regarding the development of acquisition strategies.  The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), in support of the United States Army Product Director Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Enterprise Systems and Services (PD ALTESS), seeks information on enterprise solutions for the provision of Datacenter hardware, software, and services to include the installation and maintenance of those products.
Background:
Computers, Coalition, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) and generating force systems have duplicative and redundant infrastructures. These infrastructures are frequently architecturally disparate and/or implemented and resourced inconsistently across the enterprise.   As a result, many of the Governments Programs of Record (PoRs) are built inefficiently and are not readily capable to support continuous mission evolution and rapid technology insertion. This is, in part, a consequence of the establishment and management of PoRs without sufficient reference to overarching enterprise architecture. The stovepipe approach to system development has created development, certification and fielding processes that are time-consuming, inflexible and bureaucratic, and not conducive to meet rapidly changing demands from the Warfighter. Modernization strategies and tactical execution are not adequately synchronized across Army organizations, PoRs, and Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRCs). Organizational structures and investment strategies are not aligned for enterprise product management and development (i.e., common components, centralized execution). Multiple disparate and fragmented architectures are key contributors to operational inefficiencies. Government Datacenters purchase various hardware and software, at vast quantities, to carry its mission to host system within their enclave. The hardware and software purchases are brought on many different vehicles. Once the purchase is made, the Government takes delivery of the item.  The Government then has to track the lifecycle for the maintenance of the hardware and software. Since all hardware and software is not purchased at the same time, the maintenance period of performance varies depending on when the item was purchased. Compounding the issue is the fact that maintenance agreements period of performance could be different, depending on the vendor.
To date, Industry has offered to sell hardware and software to the Government through sale or lease.  The Government is looking for options for acquiring hardware and software. 
NAICS Code 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services) with a size standard of $25.5M applies to this RFI.  
Requested Information:
1.  Information for providing the Government hardware, software, and services regarding the installation and maintenance of those products, within a datacenter setting,  that includes sale, lease and other than sale or lease.  Alternate options should include reasons for not buying or leasing, such as the length of time the item is needed and the dollar thresholds within the Government to purchase large items. 
2.   Additionally, the Government wants information that if hardware or software is contractually provided the Government, the burden of tracking the maintenance period on every hardware and software item will be borne by the contractor.  Tracking will include informing the Government 60  90 days ahead of the date when the maintenance period is about to expire.  The burden of tracking the maintenance period or performance with every item, regardless of the vehicle it is it acquired from, will be moved from the Government to the contractor to reduce contractual actions regarding non-coverage periods for hardware and software maintenance.  
3. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) status (https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx).
4. Updated Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) information (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx).
5. Recent and relevant experience with this type of enterprise solution.
Responses:
Responses should include the (1) business name and address; (2) name of company representative and their business title (3) email address, (4) phone number. 
The responses should be in a white paper format and address the capabilities identified under Requested Information. 
Firms who wish to respond to this should send responses via email NLT 19 April 2012 at 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).  The response should not exceed a 5 MB e-mail limit for all items associated with the RFI response. RFI submissions will be accepted as email attachments only.  Interested vendors should forward their capabilities and other information to be considered to: kenneth.a.macfarlane.civ@mail.mil and raina.m.carey.civ@mail.mil.
Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  All government and contractor personal reviewing RFI responses will have signed non-disclosure agreements and understand their responsibility for proper use and protection from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described 41 USC 423.  The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified.
Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.
No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov/).  It is the responsibility of potential offerors/bidders to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<p>Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Services</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address: Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Bio-containment Procurement Branch, Procurement Division, Bldg 378C, Brunswick, GA 31524-0001</p>
<p>This notice is issued as a Sources Sought Notice only, as it is anticipated that there will be a new acquisition requirement for award of an A-E contract for services for the design of the waste water thermal decontamination system at the Plum Island, NY, Animal Disease Center (PIADC). This is a unique national asset for Agro-defense and the only facility in the United States permitted to handle live FMD virus. The contract will contain options for additional services to include Construction Administration and Commissioning Services.</p>
<p>It is necessary to obtain the expertise for these services from a highly qualified Architect-Engineering firm with demonstrated expertise in the design of Bio-Safety Level 2/3/3Ag laboratories, animal vivariums, necropsies, or similar facilities. The proposed improvements and enhancements to the PIADC facility will assure the continuation of existing research as well as satisfy increased mission responsibilities for Agro-defense. The proposed improvements and enhancements are as follows: <br />&bull; Design services are required for the replacement of the current thermal decontamination system at Plum Island Animal Disease Center<br />&bull; Design of the system requires design experience with bio-containment in bio-safety level 3Ag facilities and thermal decontamination of sewage effluent generated within the facility. <br />&bull; Design will include changeover from the existing system and all tie-ins to the existing facility. <br />&bull; The new system will be a combination of renovation and new construction.</p>
<p>The Estimated Cost of Construction is approximately $30 million. Selection of the A-E will be conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act, and as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6. Firms will be evaluated in terms of their relevant experience, including relevant experience of staff members, specifically on design work required by this procurement. The combined synopsis/solicitation announcement for this requirement is anticipated to be posted on or about May 29, 2012, with A-E submittals due on or about July 10, 2012.</p>
<p>The Government intends to use the results of this Sources-Sought Announcement to determine acquisition strategy for this acquisition, utilizing NAICS Code 541310, Size Standard $4.5M. Interested A-E firms should submit letter of interest as early as possible, but not later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, April 24, 2012, to indicate interest in this acquisition by letter (no more than 2 typewritten pages) with a brief summary of experience in relevant contracts. Letters should be sent to the attention of Mrs. Melissa K Koehn, Contracting Officer, to the address noted above, preferably as an e-mail attachment, with copy to Mr. Larry Pilcher at the e-mail address below. Ensure your letter includes your business size. More detailed present/past performance information will be required with A-E submittals.</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is to collect, organize, preserve, and disseminate the world's biomedical information for the good of the public. In addition to traditional library activities related to reference services and collection development, the Library develops a wide variety of electronic resources to meet the needs of various constituencies. The Library also conducts outreach to these user communities to make them aware of the Library's resources and services and to develop their capacity to use them effectively. The Library has many specific outreach programs it supports and conducts and works with a wide variety of population groups across the U.S. The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) coordinates the development and operation of specialized information services throughout the NLM; plans, develops, and operates a National Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP); develops and administers a program to organize and analyze published information on the effects of drugs and chemicals on mankind; develops and implements information services and outreach programs in HIV/AIDS, consumer health, minority health and health disparities; and plans and operates an office supporting NLM's programs in disaster information. More details about the programs and services may be found on the SIS web site http://sis.nlm.nih.gov.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The main goal of the proposed work is to:</p>
<p>Support SIS and NLM activities intended to increase access to and awareness and use of NLM's medical and health information products and services, especially within minority (Native Americans, African Americans, etc.) and other special populations (e.g., public health workforce, emergency responders, HIV/AIDS impacted, etc.) in order to increase the use of electronic health information resources, strengthen and modernize biomedical research, training and applications and reduce health disparities. The contractor is expected to assist with the development, implementation and conduct of programs and projects that focus on the use of health information technology to achieve the goal of improving use of and access to such technology and related health information. This includes alerting NLM staff about new technologies and new implementations related to telehealth, such as the use of the Internet for video medical interpreting over distance, use of GIS technology for community empowerment and health planning, use of mobile technology, and the use of social media, virtual worlds and other Web 2.0 tools. All such endeavors are for the purpose of developing capacity in special populations to use these tools and to improve their health through the use of health information technology.</p>
<p>In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these collaborating or partner institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently. The contractor may also be required to assist NLM in its development of specific information resources and services for targeted populations.</p>
<p>The primary thrust of the contract is human-to-human interaction including identification of partners and development of relationships for NLM to pursue. The contractor will be representing NLM's interests and supporting NLM in its work rather than independently carrying out work of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contractor will be required to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Provide direct technical and programmatic support to NLM in analysis, understanding, and outreach to underserved populations and communities. Communities include, but are not limited to, refugees and their health providers, minority serving educational institutions, K-12 educators and students, HIV/AIDS affected individuals and community organizations, seniors, disaster preparedness and response agencies and organizations, and various underserved populations. Work includes the analysis of health information needs, promotion of the use of NLM's resources, assisting NLM in understanding the community and providing input and guidance to NLM as it develops resources and programs for these communities and populations.</p>
<p>Task 2: Assist NLM in identifying community partners for its outreach programs; assist NLM in developing relationships. Working closely with NLM staff, assist the Library in initiating and developing a working relationship. Assist in developing the basis for collaboration and identifying specific areas in which to work.</p>
<p>Working closely with NLM in developing and implementing projects with organizations or individuals identified. This may include subcontracting with organizations or individuals to fund specific undertakings. NLM may wish to work with up to 15 organizations or individuals in a year.</p>
<p>Task 3: Assist and support NLM in collaborations with other government (federal, state and local) agencies and offices including but not limited to local and state health and environmental protection departments; federal, state and local agencies and organizations involved in disaster planning, preparedness, response, and recovery; Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service, Office of Minority Health, Office of Global Affairs, and the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Pan American Health Organization and other World Health Organization components; other relevant organizations such as the Association of Refugee Health Coordinators, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, National Association of County and City Health Officials, Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, and other similar groups.</p>
<p>Task 4: Assist and support the following specific ongoing NLM programs:<br />&bull; Environmental Health Information Partnership<br />&bull; Refugee Health Information Network<br />&bull; Outreach associated with the Native Voices Exhibition<br />&bull; Latin American Network for Disaster and Health Information</p>
<p>These four tasks may include participating in the development of programs for or with these groups. All programs are health information or health information technology-related activities. In some cases, the contractor shall implement programs independently, mainly through subcontracts, after they have been developed in conjunction with NLM staff. Approximately 10-15 such subcontracts may be implemented each year. The contractor may also conduct program assessments or evaluations, write reports, provide background research, etc. The contractor may assist in providing on-the-ground technical support and guidance during the implementation and conduct of a project. This may require site visits and meetings held remote from NLM. The contractor may also be required to organize 1-2 workshops, symposia, or conferences related to this work. The goal of these site visits and other interactions is to provide support, direction and guidance to outreach activities promoted and supported by NLM. Working with special populations is often difficult and requires a substantial amount of direct interaction. Travel and interactions will generally be within the U.S. However, approximately 3-5 trips may be international. In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently.</p>
<p>Government Estimated Level of Effort</p>
<p>The government estimates that the following level of effort/total labor hours will be needed from the Contractor to perform the required services. The vendor may propose other level of effort/total labor hours, if they would contribute to a more efficient solution; however, the vendor must demonstrate that the personnel and proposed level of effort/total labor hours meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>Professional/technical programmatic support is required approximately 6 days per month. This is for direct involvement in NLM activities such as managing specific projects, developing agendas and organizing workshops, participating in local and national meetings related to this work, conducting assessments, authoring or drafting materials, networking to pursue a project, etc.</p>
<p>Administrative management of NLM projects takes approximately 5 days per month. This includes negotiating agreements with subcontractors and maintaining oversight over financial management of these projects, logistics support for travel related to projects, etc.</p>
<p>SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be for a base year with four (4) option years. It is anticipated that additional funding will be provided for each activity. An award is anticipated to be made around August 2012. It is anticipated that the contract will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type.</p>
<p>Contract Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor will implement specific tasks as defined above during the period of performance. The contractor shall implement these tasks with minimal direction, but in close collaboration with the government.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>The government shall provide the contractor access to relevant SIS and NLM information and staff.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br /><br />The contractor shall meet with selected members of the SIS leadership team on an as needed basis. Meetings will be held at the NLM site, and/or via teleconferencing. (All resulting software and reports will become the property of the Government.)</p>
<p>Financial reports will be submitted monthly<br />Narrative reports will be submitted quarterly</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>The (database/products/ reports) delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -Kansas City District has been tasked to study for the assessment of a nonphysical barrier to deter fish passage within a laboratory setting.<br>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of interested parties.  The procurement will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract.   This project will have a magnitude between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  <br>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 "Engineering Services".  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $4.5 million dollars per year.<br><br>Sample Scope of Work<br>Walleye emigrate from Rathbun Lake through the dam outlet structure during moderate and high flows, thereby reducing their overall population size within the Lake.  The scope of work for this project includes the evaluation of walleye exposed to negative stimuli including light, sound, and an air bubble curtain, both singly and in various combinations, to determine which negative stimuli would most effectively deter walleye away from the Lake outlet to prevent emigration loss.  This information would be used to evaluate the potential effectiveness of an in-lake nonphysical barrier to prevent walleye emigration.  This evaluation would take place at the Rathbun Lake Fish Hatchery with assistance from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Fisheries Bureau.<br>A contractor experienced with fish deterrent technology would provide and set up negative stimuli including bubble curtains, lights, and sound, within a controlled aquatic environment.   Estimated flow within the test pond would be approximately 800 gallons per minute to mimic Lake outlet flow.  The contractor would ensure the proper operation of negative stimuli equipment after initial setup, and provide IDNR Fisheries staff the training and information to maintain and operate this equipment to successfully expose and document walleye reaction to negative stimuli.  The contractor would provide initial set up and consultation, and would be available by phone and e-mail throughout the study for periodic consultation.  The contractor would not be required to be on site during the 120-day estimated study timeframe. <br>IDNR would provide the walleye, test pond facility, construct the testing area, develop the study methodology, maintain water quality, tag and track walleye throughout the study, and provide all additional labor required for this project.  All equipment provided by the contractor would be returned to the contractor by IDNR when the study is completed.<br><br>This sources sought notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is NOT guaranteed.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this notice with a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 17 April 2012 by 14:00 (CST).

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) plans to solicit for the development of a kit or modification of the following Thermal Weapon Sights (TWS): 

1)AN/PAS-13D Heavy Thermal Weapon Sight (HTWS) into an in-line thermal sight that can be used in conjunction with the Heavy Machine Gun Sight System (HMGSS).

<DESC>Attention all vendors!  Your feedback is sought to provide feedback on the<br>Pre-Award and Post-Award debriefing process related to federal government<br>procurements.   <br><br>Background.  A government research team jointly sponsored by the Army<br>Acquisition Support Center and the Partnership for Public Service is<br>conducting a study to determine the value and effectiveness of debriefings<br>given by government contracting agencies to vendors bidding for federal<br>contracts.  To help make that assessment, the team has developed an on-line<br>survey to capture feedback from vendors who have received Pre-Award or<br>Post-Award debriefings.<br><br>Target audience:  All vendors who have: (a) submitted bids on federal<br>contracts within the last 3 years; and (b) participated in at least one<br>Pre-Award or Post-Award debriefing conducted by a federal contracting<br>officer or agency.<br><br>What is requested?  Completion of the on-line survey found at the web site<br>listed below.<br><br>Why is my participation & feedback important?  As the ultimate "customer" of<br>the feedback sessions, the research team wants to know if the process is<br>useful to you and your company and, if not, what the government can do to<br>make it better.<br><br>How long will it take to complete?  10 - 15 minutes. The survey consists of<br>17 questions-most of which are multiple choice along with several<br>opportunities to add narrative remarks.<br><br>Are my responses secure and anonymous?  Yes.  <br><br>How will the results be used?  The results will be summarized for analysis<br>to determine how the debriefing process can be improved.  The team plans to<br>make the findings available to any federal contracting activity operating<br>under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines.  It is<br>anticipated some of the recommendations will be incorporated into agency<br>policies, publications and training material to assist the federal<br>acquisition workforce in conducting better debriefings.<br><br>Will I be able to see or access the research team's findings and report?<br>While the details have not yet been finalized, the team plans to make the<br>information available to all interested parties on or about 1 Aug 2012 via<br>an amendment  or another posting to FEBBIZ.<br><br>ACCESS THE SURVEY NOW BY CLICKING ON THE LINK BELOW:<br><br>(By clicking below, you will be redirected to a web site operated by<br>SurveyMonkeyR.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to extend an existing contract on a sole source basis to Canon U.S.A., 2110 Washington Boulevard Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22204-5710, for the Copier Maintenance Services contract at Fort Hood, Texas. The proposed contract action will extend the performance period of the contract W91151-08-F-0001 by six months under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Estimated dollar value of this action is $800,000.00, for the period of performance: 1 October 2010 through 1 March 2011. The Government intent is to extend the current services with Canon in order for Fort Hood to continue using the copiers while they are being transitioned off of Fort Hood as new awards are made.  Fort Hoods methodology for this transition will serve as the 7th Signal Commands test bed for decentralization of copier services to end users.  The results of the project will serve as the basis for 7th Signal Command policy for decentralization of copier services CONUS-wide. Multiple Call Orders against Blanket Purchase Agreements will be funded as requirements occur. Since the copiers remain on the installation and must be removed within this next six months, there is no possibility that other contractors can meet the current requirement for use of these copiers until their removal.  Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: joe.pollard1@us.army.mil, no later than 1 October 2010 at 1200 CST. Questions submitted by other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 532420. There is no associated small business size standard. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This purchase is for training to assist Native Nations in strengthening tribal sovereignty and improving social and economic conditions on their lands by accelerating capacity for self-determined social and economic development. The Harvard Project/Native Nations Institute has considerable experience in offering such programs and has an abundance of knowledge and expertise in working with Native Americans. The contemplated award will be approximately $129,000. Statement of WorkTraining to accelerate the development of Native American owned entrepreneurial business. 1. Introduction. Tribal reservations are some of the most isolated and economically depressed areas of the country. Reservations are plagued with high unemployment, limited educational opportunities, poor infrastructure, and high rates of crime and substance abuse. The overall goal is to increase business development on Indian lands in order to assist economically distressed communities. The Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development (IEED) has an agenda that includes assisting Native Americans to create an ownership society in which wealth is created, retained, and reinvested in the local economies to provide self-sufficiency and sustainable revenue streams. To assist in this endeavor, IEED will be developing a partnership with an academic institution of higher learning to assist Indian tribes and individual tribal members to develop and foster conditions under which sustained, self-determined social and economic development is achieved among American Indian nations. The institution will bring world-class research and teaching to bear on the challenges of contemporary Native Nations and leaders for the purpose of enhancing the ability of officials and others to advance the well-being of those Native Nations through sound management, government and policy. 2. Proposed Technical Work. The academic institution will conduct: a. an intensive three-day executive program to provide participants with a detailed understanding of how to create a high performing business enterprise. b. special focus programs developed for special needs (such as managerial negotiations, e-business, customer-focused business, etc.).In addition, DOI would establish a recognition program with the Business School to provide participants with a certificate from the school acknowledging successful completion of the program. Tentative Dates for Sessions:Salt Lake City May 22-24, 2012San Diego, CA June 26-28, 2012New Orleans, LA August 14-16, 2012The Tuck School has as part of its mission to provide positive educational experiences to Native Americans. Dartmouth College's Royal Charter in 1769 explicitly charged the college with the responsibility to educate Native Americans and this remains an educational priority. The Tuck School ran its first minority business program in 1980 and has steadily expanded its offerings. Today, Tuck manages a network of over 3,500 alumni and has offered courses all over the country.

<SUBJECT>Mobile Laboratory
<SOLNBR>12-RFI-040912
<RESPDATE>050212
<CONTACT>Lynda M. Theisen, Fax 703-632-8480, Email Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses to provide a Mobile Laboratory (ML). The Government intends to award a contract under a separate solicitation, but with this notice wants to obtain capabilities, delivery, or other market information for planning purposes. All interested, capable, and responsible are encouraged to submit a response to this notice. <br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<p>The Laboratory Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is developing requirements for a mobile laboratory for the triage of hazardous samples and evidence. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to formulate final requirements for an FBI Mobile Laboratory (ML) and to identify qualified manufacturers and vendors capable of meeting those requirements. The description below outlines preliminary requirements envisioned for the ML. Respondents should identify their capabilities that would help fulfill the currently envisioned ML requirements as well as any alternative ideas that would improve current concepts. The information gathered will be used to formulate final requirements, which will subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Crime scene investigations involving chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) materials present special difficulties for evidence collection, packaging, and transport. Such scenes may require unusually extensive laboratory analysis both for forensic and safety purposes. Any recovered CBR materials must be analyzed along with traditional forensic evidence that is potentially contaminated with CBR agent. In addition, extensive environmental analysis may be necessary either to provide hazard awareness during evidence collection or to reconstruct contamination events and thereby establish facts of a case.</p>
<p>The Operational Response Section (ORS) of the FBI Laboratory is responsible for investigating hazardous crime scenes. Currently, evidence and samples collected from contaminated environments are packaged and transported for analysis at appropriate laboratories. Although this approach is functional, experience has shown that it has severe limitations that impede efficient sample processing including 1) limited laboratory capacity for large sample numbers, 2) limited locations of suitable laboratories, and 3) a lack of analytical methods specific to the law enforcement mission. Processing efficiency would be greatly improved with the availability of a mobile analytical capability that could be situated at or very near large CB investigation sites.</p>
<p>In the past, sample analysis bottlenecks have been obviated by introducing methods in which sample collectors partially processed samples at the search site before they were transported to the laboratory for presumptive identification of the analyte, which sufficed under the circumstances and facilitated rapid actionable results.</p>
<p><strong>Concept of operation.</strong> The ML should be versatile and convertible enough to allow for chemical and biological agents when required. The ML should be purpose-built; designed to accommodate the specific analytical needs that may be encountered. High sample throughput should be a primary consideration for facility design and choice of analytical systems. Analysis will be limited to samples previously rendered non-hazardous or minimally hazardous by dilution, extraction, or other treatment prior to entering the facility. Lightweight containment equipment suitable for the hazard level will be chosen. Analytical information should be interpreted in the context of a search as quickly as possible because of the amplified hazards and costs associated with hazardous crime scenes. A geographical information system (GIS) is required for rapid assimilation of sampling data. The GIS may be stand-alone, or integrated with a separate facility via appropriate communications equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>The government requests that the contractor or contractors provide either all or a portion of the following: mobile laboratory platform (vehicle or tent system), analytical equipment and related methods, containment equipment and methods of use, administrative space and materials, communications equipment, utilities, installation, and initial training for use.</p>
<p>Options for mobile triage facility platforms. Several platforms will be considered including tents, vans, mobile containers, trucks up to 24 ft., and trailers to 45 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering controls</strong>: (a) Secondary containment equipment. The laboratory structure must contain a system that ensures that air exhausting from the facility is not hazardous. Systems will be considered that filter biological and chemical agents. Air handling systems must be easy to clean and decontaminate. Some primary containment equipment cannot operate properly unless the surrounding airflow and pressure is within specific limits. Since the secondary containment system determines the airflow and pressure of the working environment in the structure, the system must be chosen considering the performance requirements of the primary containment equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering controls</strong>: (b) Primary containment equipment. A mobile laboratory platform with purpose built primary containment equipment is preferred over retrofitting. Containment equipment for CB materials may include Class III glove boxes, Class II Biological Safety Cabinets (BSC), chemical fume hoods. Lighter materials may be suitable if available, including aluminum and plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory construction materials:</strong> The laboratory space in a mobile facility should be constructed of material that is durable and resistant to chemical degradation. The construction should be such that the number and depth of seams, crevices, and difficult to reach surfaces are minimized. Surfaces should be easy to clean and decontaminate. If possible the entire interior should be amenable to gas decontamination (e.g., vaporous hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, formaldehyde).</p>
<p><strong>Electrical.</strong> A mobile facility should be able to generate sufficient electricity for stand-alone operations and be able to use external electric sources. The on-board electrical supply should be able to support adequate interior and exterior lighting, communications equipment, climate control, and all containment and analytical equipment that may be used simultaneously. An uninterruptible power supply is required to provide adequate time for contingency operations in the event of power failure.</p>
<p><strong>Water and plumbing</strong>. The mobile facility should contain a stand-alone water supply and be able to use an external water supply. One or more sinks is required with adequate chemical and biological waste storage as well as a waste decontamination or removal system.</p>
<p><strong>Waste removal</strong>. A mobile facility must include features that permit safe disposition of any solid or liquid waste that may be generated.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical and ancillary laboratory</strong> <strong>equipment.</strong> Subject matter experts from the chemical and biological disciplines will identify specific analytical equipment required for a mobile triage facility. Primary analytical equipment will be chosen based on its suitability for specific analysis requirements, sample throughput, ease of use, durability, and cost. Method development and equipment acquisition may be part of an ongoing process separate from the acquisition of a mobile triage facility. Standard laboratory equipment required to support the chosen analytical methods will be supplied on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>Administrative work area, communications, evidence/sample tracking, and mapping. The mobile facility must contain sufficient on-board secure communications capability to facilitate continual receipt of instructions and reporting of results without the need for facility personnel to exit the workspace. The facility must be efficiently integrated into the sample tracking system for the crime scene and must contain an administrative work area to support the tracking and communication functions. Data generated from laboratory analysis can often be placed into context by two- or three-dimensional mapping of results at the crime scene. This function will require integration with a separate facility.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: In support of the Blended-Wing-Body aircraft concept, researchers at NASAs LangleyResearch Center have developed a new flow control hybrid vane/jet design for use in aboundary-layer-ingesting (BLI) offset inlet in transonic flows. This inlet flow controlis designed to minimize the engine fan-face distortion levels and the first five Fourierharmonic half amplitudes while maximizing the inlet pressure recovery. This conceptrepresents a potentially enabling technology for quieter and more environmentallyfriendly transport aircraft.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<p>Malm. I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

<DESC>SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS): Surveillance Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, has a requirement for a vendor to develop and produce a training DVD.
<p>This requirement is solicited as unrestricted.</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work</p>
<p>Video Services for the Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS) - NIOSH Spirometry Training DVD</p>
<p>I. Background &amp; Need</p>
<p>The Surveillance Branch (SB) of DRDS will develop and produce a training DVD to conform with the most recent American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society spirometry standard guidelines (2005). The DVD will review 1) training for testing personnel, 2) a brief background on the usefulness of spirometry in the occupational setting, 3) occupational lung diseases, 4) types of spirometry testing equipment, 5) equipment calibration checks, 6) technical procedures for administering a test session, 7) guidelines for acceptability of test maneuvers and repeatability of a test session, 8) appropriate coaching methods, and 9) reporting spirometry results.</p>
<p>This spirometry training DVD is needed because spirometer manufacturers do not provide all the information that NIOSH deems essential for spirometry testing. In the 1980s, NIOSH produced a film used in the NIOSH-Approved Spirometry Training Courses; however, standard practice guidelines have changed and newer measurement technologies have become available since that time.</p>
<p>II. Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to obtain video production services that will help NIOSH develop and deliver training materials, in the form of a digital video product, specifically for respiratory health surveillance programs. The contractor will provide professional video production services using NIOSH-provided raw footage, audio, graphics, and images in support of the research project, "NIOSH Training Products: Spirometry Quality Assurance" conducted by DRDS. This video will help satisfy a critical need in training health care providers in the proper procedures for collecting valid spirometry results.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The contractor will produce an English speaking spirometry training video for healthcare providers in occupational respiratory surveillance programs. To accomplish this, the contractor will use video footage captured by the NIOSH project officer and others, edit the video footage (available in in DVC pro 25 tape format and artistic background video in MOV, MP4, AVi, or wmv) as directed by the NIOSH project officer, and use Adobe (Creative Suite 5) products to produce a video product for NIOSH. The video product will need to go through a formal NIOSH clearance process and the vendor will be responsible for making the editorial changes requested by NIOSH reviewers to produce a final video product. The final product will be published by NIOSH for dissemination.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to provide all of the equipment necessary to carry out this work including the digital audio and video equipment, the hardware and software to edit the digital video collected, and equipment to create DVD format that can be played in a DVD player or computer with DVD capabilities; the DVD must be capable of being copied for mass distribution.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for delivery of products to the NIOSH project officer.</p>
<p>IV. Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>The contractor will provide the expertise to complete the tasks outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Create and provide to NIOSH time-stamped DVD versions of all raw footage gathered by NIOSH (approximately 40 hours of footage);<br />2.

<DESC>GSA, FAS intends to establish a "not to exceed" ONE year (1 yr) Standing Price Quote SPQ for 1 National Stock Number (NSN) in the FSC 8010. Item is in the Heartland Supply Operations Center (HSOC) Special Order Program (SOP). The SPQ will begin on the date of award and will not exceed a ONE YEAR period. Direct Delivery orders to a specific end user will be issued under subject SPQ. Clauses that apply to all GSA Heartland Supply Operations Center, Special Order Program (SOP) orders apply to this SPQ.  Award could be based on past performance, price, minimum order quantities and/or delivery.  For questions, please contact Paula Schulte by phone (816-926-1298) or e-mail (paula.schulte@gsa.gov).  NOTE: This is a total small business set aside. An exception to the nonmanufacturing rule is applicable.  A small business nonmanufacturer can provide the product of any domestic firm and still be considered for award as the total estimated dollar value is under $25,000 over the one year estimated period of the Standing Price Quote.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective March 14, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 541 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed https://orca.bpn.gov/.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

<p>The Enterprise Systems Division (ESD) of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking to obtain cloud management software to deploy a hybrid private (on-premise) and public cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that uses NIST's existing VMware ESX infrastructure and supports AWS-compatible public cloud resources. ESD's goal is to offer NIST's Scientists an on-demand, self-service portal to IT resources using NIST's own IT resources and IT resources in public cloud space.</p>
<p>There are many cloud products in the market place, but NIST has determined Eucalyptus Enterprise Edition is the only IaaS cloud management software currently on the market that is built open source and supports private and public cloud infrastructure.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-12073, a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-57, dated March 15, 2012. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 112990, which has a small-business size standard of $0.75 in millions of dollars. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure 4 - 1 year old Rhesus Monkeys (either gender) on a sole source basis from the University of California, Davis. This is the only known vendor to provide 4 animals of the same age that are seronegative for the Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus viruses. We have previously obtained the Rhesus Monkeys from the vendor, which animals from different sources have different backgrounds cannot be pooled with others. Animals with different environmental backgrounds will have different responses to vaccines and this cannot be adequately controlled. The University of California Davis will house and raise the monkeys for one (1) year to avoid becoming infected. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) capability to produce 4 - one (1) year age Rhesus Monkeys, 2) comply with NIAID animal assurance of handling animals, 3) price, and 4) delivery.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel.

During this period it will be required that these<br />personnel have full access to the vessel during normal working hours.<br />7] If the vessel is hauled from the water, the Contractor will ensure that all machinery and equipment<br />used for that purpose is fully functional, suitable for the task, rated for loads at least 20% greater than<br />the maximum weight of the vessel, and operated by trained, competent personnel. The NOAA COTR will<br />provide a docking plan for the vessel if requested.<br />8] The government reserves the right to award some or all tasks defined herein, and to add tasks during<br />the work period so long as period of performance revisions, if any, are mutually agreed.<br />9] All work performed under this SOW (or added to it during the period of performance) will meet or<br />exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of<br />vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.<br />10] In the event defects or damage unrelated to the work tasks defined below are discovered, the<br />Contractor will submit a Condition Found Report (CFR) to the COTR. The CFR will define corrective<br />actions needed, the cost for that work (separated into labor, materials, services, and total), and the<br />impact to the performance period.<br />2<br />11] All welding required as part of the tasks defined below will be performed by welders certified by ABS<br />or USCG working in accordance with welding procedures approved by ABS or USCG. Copies of<br />certifications and procedures will be provided to the COTR before work commences.<br />B] SPECIFIC WORK TASKS<br />1] Haul, clean, block, store, and launch:<br />Remove the vessel from the water. Pressure&#8208;wash the entire hull from sheer line to keel removing all<br />dirt, grime, and marine growth. If the vessel is a catamaran, clean all surfaces within the tunnel.<br />Similarly, clean all fittings below waterline, including propulsor components, struts, stern tubes, rudders,<br />foils, fins, through&#8208;hulls, etc. If the vessel is fitted with waterjet propulsors, clean the interior of the jets.<br />Do not damage any existing anti&#8208;fouling paint unless further tasks in this SOW require its removal. Clean<br />transducers with a non&#8208;metallic brush, taking care to not mar the emitting surface in any way. Clean all<br />surfaces of all anodes with a wire brush unless they are to be replaced.<br />Block the vessel in a level attitude with the keel (or keels) 36" minimum off the ground. Inspect the hull,<br />coatings, and all attachments and report any damage or discrepancies to the COTR in writing. Provide<br />electrical power to the vessel suitable for its shore power system.<br />Upon completion of all work done on the hard, launch the vessel, inspect all compartments for leaks,<br />and secure it dockside. If dockside testing or underway trials are required after launch, provide prior<br />notification to the COTR so NOAA personnel can attend.<br />2] Underbody coating system:<br />Prepare and touch&#8208;up and flaws in the underbody coating system with the same coating as currently<br />applied. Manufacturer's procedures will be used in all cases. Color to match existing coatings. The<br />contractor will ensure that all the environmental conditions are within the manufacture's specified<br />parameters prior to starting application processes and for all coatings. A written "as&#8208;cleaned" condition<br />report shall be submitted to the COTR prior to painting.<br />3] Inspect all seacocks:<br />Open, actuate, and visually inspect all seacocks in the hull bottom and topsides. A written report shall<br />be submitted to the COTR detailing the location and condition of seacocks, and recommending any<br />corrective action required. Include quotes for all recommended repairs.<br />4] Modify multi&#8208;beam mount<br />Remove the upper portion of the multi&#8208;beam transducer housing, lowering the watertight side walls to a<br />position 4" above static full load waterline, and reconstitute the upper flange. Revise the brackets and<br />mounting tabs to allow the transducer to be removed while the vessel is waterborne without causing<br />flooding of the bilge. The modified transducer mounting plate will be installed with rubber grommets<br />and plastic sleeves to reduce transducer vibration and galvanically isolate fasteners. Install a welded<br />loop or eye on the inside of the transducer well, and install a 1/8" stainless steel cable safety lanyard to<br />the transducer mounting plate.<br />Note: Provide drawings of all proposed modification to the COTR prior to commencing work.<br />Reinstall the transducer. Upon launch test transducer operation at speeds up to 8 knots to prove<br />adequate function. Run the vessel to maximum speed with the transducer shutdown to prove no<br />excessive vibrations or noise is generated.<br />3<br />5] Service waterjets<br />Replace all internal and external anodes on both jets. Replace the water seals, oil seals, thrust bearings,<br />and seal sleeves in both jets. Replace the steering cranks on both jets. This work will include the<br />replacement of associated nylon locking fasteners, gaskets, and O&#8208;rings as required. Upon launching of<br />the vessel, test both jets at all speeds and throughout their maneuvering range to demonstrate full<br />function.<br />6] Realign P&amp;S engines<br />Realign the main engines to the waterjets by shifting their position in the hull. If required, revise the<br />engine bearers and/or vibration mount bolting holes to retain full strength and support. The clutch<br />output flanges and jet input flanges will be aligned parallel to within 0.003" as measured at diametrically<br />opposed edges of the flanges, and flange longitudinal centerline offset will be held to within the<br />tolerance of the drive shaft U&#8208;joints. See notes from Precision Maintenance Inc. alignment performed<br />9/21/11. Alignment notes are included in the SOW, pages 4 and 5. Additionally, and if required,<br />reposition the engine&#8208;driven hydraulic pump and any other engine&#8208;driven equipment to maintain<br />alignments. Upon launch of the vessel, measure alignment and adjust while water&#8208;borne to tolerances<br />stated above. After all alignment work is complete, trial the vessel at all speeds to prove accurate<br />alignment and full function of machinery.<br />7] Install GFM inverter/charger<br />Remove the existing inverter/charger in the vessel and replace it with the unit supplied by the<br />government. Provide all other parts required to complete the installation. Where required, upgrade<br />breakers, cables, and wires associated with the inverter/charger to meet all applicable standards of<br />ABYC and USCG. Upon completion, test the unit to prove full function in both inverter and charger<br />modes.<br />8] Install bilge alarms<br />Install an additional float switch in the forward void, the tank room, and the engine room, these to<br />function as a high bilge water alarm sensors. Position these switches 4" above the existing bilge pump<br />actuation switches and in a secure location in the aft sections of each compartment. Install a small<br />indicator panel (or three separate panels) in the console and wire these to the alarm new sensors.<br />Panels will provide audible and visual indication that the sensors have been tripped, and a mute button<br />for the audible function only. The panels will be positioned and labeled to denote location in the hull.<br />Power for the sensors and panels may be taken off the bilge pump circuits or a new circuit if space is<br />available. Upon completion test each sensor and panel to prove complete functionality.<br />*End of Scope of Work*<br />Laser Alignments &bull; In-field Balancing &bull; Vibration Diagnostics<br />Visit us at www pminw.com<br />COMPANY: N.O.A.A SHIP/PLANT: Tatoosh R/V DATE: 09/21/2011<br />MACHINE Port M/E to R/G SPEED: 2200 Rpm TECHNICIAN: Troy Stocks<br />UNITS: ENGLISH / METRIC<br />FOOT POSITION<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />OFFSET ANGULARITY ALIGNMENT AT THE COUPLING (@ 10")<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />ANGULARITY OFFSET ANGULARITY OFFSET<br />Initial Cold -30 235 -75 36<br />Final Cold -5 110 -20 49<br />Initial Hot<br />Final Hot<br />TARGETS / TOLERANCES<br />+/-5 100+/-3 +/-5 +/-3<br />NOTES: Alignment was corrected to the angle of 1.5 vertical.

<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which proposals will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of Price, Technical Acceptability, and Present/Past Performance. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the Government. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options (See paragraph (b) below).</p>
<p>Price Evaluation for Utilization of FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services Clause: In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will calculate prices for a quantity equivalent to 6 months by prorating prices offered for CLINs 0001 including the corresponding CLINs under Options of FAR 52.217-9 and evaluate such prices for reasonableness.</p>
<p>(ii) The lowest priced proposal will then be evaluated for Technical Acceptability to ensure that the offeror understands and is technically capable of performing the requirement. Proposals will be evaluated on a "met" or "failed" basis. To achieve a "met" rating, the offer shall submit copies of all required business licenses necessary to accomplish the work described in the Performance Work Statement (Solicitation Attachment #2), Japanese Public Law, and Japanese Environmental Governing Regulations. Offerors that do not send in all of their required business certificates prior to the solicitation closing date (23 Apr 12) will be rated as "failed." Proposals that are rated as "failed" for Technical Acceptability shall not be considered for award and the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>(iii) The lowest priced technically acceptable offeror will then be evaluated for Present/Past Performance. Using Present/Past Performance Questionnaire, the Government shall seek performance information on the offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offerors and (2) data independently obtained from governmental and commercial sources. The purpose of the Present/Past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's performance risk (i.e., the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully performing the effort described in this solicitation), based on the offeror's demonstrated Present/Past Performance on relevant contracts. Relevancy definitions are listed below in paragraph (a)(v)(B)(1)(2). Present/Past Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may be evaluated. When relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The performance confidence assessment process will result in one of two overall risk assessments:</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Not Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>If an offeror's performance record is found to be Not Acceptable, that offeror shall not be considered for award and the next lowest price technically acceptable offeror shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>(iv) In evaluating Present/Past Performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(v) Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) below. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of Present/Past Performance Information) or respond to adverse Present/Past Performance Information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p><br />A. Present/Past Performance Information: Only references for same or similar type contracts desired. Submit originals. The response shall consist of (1) Present/Past Performance Reference List and (2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(1) Present/Past Performance Reference List: Present/Past Performance Reference List (Solicitation Attachment # 4) shall be used and submitted from offerors to Eric Schmitt, 374 CONS/LGCB, by either e-mail at eric.schmitt.1@us.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846, not later than 23 Apr 2012 to match the information of Present/Past Performance Questionnaire as required in below paragraph (2). Offerors shall submit the reference list of three contracts performed (on-going or completed) as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures and/or teaming partners of the most relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) for US Government agencies, Government of Japan or its political subdivisions, or commercial customers within the last three years of this solicitation release date. Furnish the following information for each reference on the list of contracts information:</p>
<p>1. Name of contracting activity (e.g. Government Agency/Company name)<br />2. Point of Contact (POC), Contracting Officer and/or Contract Administrator's phone/FAX number, and e-mail address (if available) <br />3. Contract number and project title<br />4. Contract Type (e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, IDIQ, Requirements type)<br />5. Total contract value<br />6. Performance period (e.g. date/month/year through date/month/year)<br />7. Description of contract work performed<br />8. Contracting Officer's name and phone number<br />9. Government Inspector/commercial project manager and phone number<br />10. List of major subcontractors if applicable<br /><br />In addition, the offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts identified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) above and corrective actions taken to resolve these problems. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.</p>
<p>(2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire: The Government requires the Present/Past Performance Information of the contracts identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List from each contracting activity or commercial activities. The offeror shall send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire (See Solicitation Attachment # 5) to respective Points of Contact (POCs) of contracting activity identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List. The responsibility to send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity. Once the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire is completed by your POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be releasable. Present/Past Performance Questionnaire shall be sent directly back to 374 CONS/LGCB from evaluating agencies/companies, not later than 23 Apr 2012 by either e-mail eric.schmitt@yokota.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846. Offerors are responsible for ensuring that their reference sources receive the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire in time to complete and return the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire to 374th Contracting Squadron. No Present/Past Performance Questionnaire will be accepted directly from the offeror being evaluated. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>B. Present/Past Performance Evaluation:</p>
<p><br />(1) Present/Past Performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Recency: Each contract will be confirmed whether the contract has been completed during the past three years from this solicitation release date, or is currently in progress.</p>
<p>2. Relevancy: Submit information on contracts that you consider relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) may include the work requirement(s) listed in Description of Services under paragraph 1 of the PWS. A relevancy determination of the offeror's Present/Past Performance as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures, and/or teaming partners will be made. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy score for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply:</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved essentially the same scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved much of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved some of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort did not involve any of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>3. Quality: Quality Assessment is assigned based on the Quality Assessment Criteria below on the Present/Past Questionnaire (Solicitation Attachment # 4)</p>
<p>(1) Quality of Work<br />(2) Timely Performance/Schedule<br />(3) Effectiveness of Management for Resolution of Issues/Problems/Customer Complaints<br />(4) Compliance with the Applicable Rules, Regulations, Laws, including Safety Standards</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>6) DESCRIPTION: <br />a) See Attachment 1, Price Information Septic Tanks.</p>
<p>7) PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br />a) Date: 1 June 2012 through 28 Feb 2013, and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>8) Deadline for receipt of offers: 23 April 2012, 1600 PM, Japan Standard Time.</p>
<p>9) A Site Visit/Orientation for this contract will be conducted on 16 Apr 2012 at 0845. All interested vendors intending to submit a proposal need to arrive at the Supply Gate (Gate #5) at Yokota AB, Japan at 0830 so pass issuance can be completed/validated.</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which proposals will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of Price, Technical Acceptability, and Present/Past Performance. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the Government. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options (See paragraph (b) below).</p>
<p>Price Evaluation for Utilization of FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services Clause: In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will calculate prices for a quantity equivalent to 6 months by prorating prices offered for CLINs 0001 including the corresponding CLINs under Options of FAR 52.217-9 and evaluate such prices for reasonableness.</p>
<p>(ii) The lowest priced proposal will then be evaluated for Technical Acceptability to ensure that the offeror understands and is technically capable of performing the requirement. Proposals will be evaluated on a "met" or "failed" basis. To achieve a "met" rating, the offer shall submit copies of all required business licenses necessary to accomplish the work described in the Performance Work Statement (Solicitation Attachment #2), Japanese Public Law, and Japanese Environmental Governing Regulations. Offerors that do not send in all of their required business certificates prior to the solicitation closing date (23 Apr 2012) will be rated as "failed." Proposals that are rated as "failed" for Technical Acceptability shall not be considered for award and the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>(iii) The lowest priced technically acceptable offeror will then be evaluated for Present/Past Performance. Using Present/Past Performance Questionnaire, the Government shall seek performance information on the offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offerors and (2) data independently obtained from governmental and commercial sources. The purpose of the Present/Past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's performance risk (i.e., the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully performing the effort described in this solicitation), based on the offeror's demonstrated Present/Past Performance on relevant contracts. Relevancy definitions are listed below in paragraph (a)(v)(B)(1)(2). Present/Past Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may be evaluated. When relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The performance confidence assessment process will result in one of two overall risk assessments:</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Not Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>If an offeror's performance record is found to be Not Acceptable, that offeror shall not be considered for award and the next lowest price technically acceptable offeror shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>(iv) In evaluating Present/Past Performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(v) Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) below. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of Present/Past Performance Information) or respond to adverse Present/Past Performance Information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p><br />A. Present/Past Performance Information: Only references for same or similar type contracts desired. Submit originals. The response shall consist of (1) Present/Past Performance Reference List and (2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(1) Present/Past Performance Reference List: Present/Past Performance Reference List (Solicitation Attachment # 4) shall be used and submitted from offerors to Eric Schmitt, 374 CONS/LGCB, by either e-mail at eric.schmitt.1@us.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846, not later than 23 Apr 2012 to match the information of Present/Past Performance Questionnaire as required in below paragraph (2). Offerors shall submit the reference list of three contracts performed (on-going or completed) as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures and/or teaming partners of the most relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) for US Government agencies, Government of Japan or its political subdivisions, or commercial customers within the last three years of this solicitation release date. Furnish the following information for each reference on the list of contracts information:</p>
<p>1. Name of contracting activity (e.g. Government Agency/Company name)<br />2. Point of Contact (POC), Contracting Officer and/or Contract Administrator's phone/FAX number, and e-mail address (if available) <br />3. Contract number and project title<br />4. Contract Type (e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, IDIQ, Requirements type)<br />5. Total contract value<br />6. Performance period (e.g. date/month/year through date/month/year)<br />7. Description of contract work performed<br />8. Contracting Officer's name and phone number<br />9. Government Inspector/commercial project manager and phone number<br />10. List of major subcontractors if applicable<br /><br />In addition, the offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts identified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) above and corrective actions taken to resolve these problems. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.</p>
<p>(2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire: The Government requires the Present/Past Performance Information of the contracts identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List from each contracting activity or commercial activities. The offeror shall send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire (See Solicitation Attachment # 5) to respective Points of Contact (POCs) of contracting activity identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List. The responsibility to send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity. Once the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire is completed by your POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be releasable. Present/Past Performance Questionnaire shall be sent directly back to 374 CONS/LGCB from evaluating agencies/companies, not later than 23 Apr 2012 by either e-mail eric.schmitt@yokota.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846. Offerors are responsible for ensuring that their reference sources receive the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire in time to complete and return the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire to 374th Contracting Squadron. No Present/Past Performance Questionnaire will be accepted directly from the offeror being evaluated. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>B. Present/Past Performance Evaluation:</p>
<p><br />(1) Present/Past Performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Recency: Each contract will be confirmed whether the contract has been completed during the past three years from this solicitation release date, or is currently in progress.</p>
<p>2. Relevancy: Submit information on contracts that you consider relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) may include the work requirement(s) listed in Description of Services under paragraph 1 of the PWS. A relevancy determination of the offeror's Present/Past Performance as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures, and/or teaming partners will be made. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy score for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply:</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved essentially the same scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved much of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved some of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort did not involve any of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>3. Quality: Quality Assessment is assigned based on the Quality Assessment Criteria below on the Present/Past Questionnaire (Solicitation Attachment # 4)</p>
<p>(1) Quality of Work<br />(2) Timely Performance/Schedule<br />(3) Effectiveness of Management for Resolution of Issues/Problems/Customer Complaints<br />(4) Compliance with the Applicable Rules, Regulations, Laws, including Safety Standards</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items - Alternate 1</p>

<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which proposals will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of Price, Technical Acceptability, and Present/Past Performance. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the Government. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options (See paragraph (b) below).</p>
<p>Price Evaluation for Utilization of FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services Clause: In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will calculate prices for a quantity equivalent to 6 months by prorating prices offered for CLINs 0001 including the corresponding CLINs under Options of FAR 52.217-9 and evaluate such prices for reasonableness.</p>
<p>(ii) The lowest priced proposal will then be evaluated for Technical Acceptability to ensure that the offeror understands and is technically capable of performing the requirement. Proposals will be evaluated on a "met" or "failed" basis. To achieve a "met" rating, the offer shall submit copies of all required business licenses necessary to accomplish the work described in the Performance Work Statement (Solicitation Attachment #2), Japanese Public Law, and Japanese Environmental Governing Regulations. Offerors that do not send in all of their required business certificates prior to the solicitation closing date (23 Apr 2012) will be rated as "failed." Proposals that are rated as "failed" for Technical Acceptability shall not be considered for award and the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>(iii) The lowest priced technically acceptable offeror will then be evaluated for Present/Past Performance. Using Present/Past Performance Questionnaire, the Government shall seek performance information on the offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offerors and (2) data independently obtained from governmental and commercial sources. The purpose of the Present/Past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's performance risk (i.e., the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully performing the effort described in this solicitation), based on the offeror's demonstrated Present/Past Performance on relevant contracts. Relevancy definitions are listed below in paragraph (a)(v)(B)(1)(2). Present/Past Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may be evaluated. When relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The performance confidence assessment process will result in one of two overall risk assessments:</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Not Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>If an offeror's performance record is found to be Not Acceptable, that offeror shall not be considered for award and the next lowest price technically acceptable offeror shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>(iv) In evaluating Present/Past Performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(v) Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) below. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of Present/Past Performance Information) or respond to adverse Present/Past Performance Information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p><br />A. Present/Past Performance Information: Only references for same or similar type contracts desired. Submit originals. The response shall consist of (1) Present/Past Performance Reference List and (2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(1) Present/Past Performance Reference List: Present/Past Performance Reference List (Solicitation Attachment # 4) shall be used and submitted from offerors to Eric Schmitt, 374 CONS/LGCB, by either e-mail at eric.schmitt.1@us.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846, not later than 23 Apr 2012 to match the information of Present/Past Performance Questionnaire as required in below paragraph (2). Offerors shall submit the reference list of three contracts performed (on-going or completed) as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures and/or teaming partners of the most relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) for US Government agencies, Government of Japan or its political subdivisions, or commercial customers within the last three years of this solicitation release date. Furnish the following information for each reference on the list of contracts information:</p>
<p>1. Name of contracting activity (e.g. Government Agency/Company name)<br />2. Point of Contact (POC), Contracting Officer and/or Contract Administrator's phone/FAX number, and e-mail address (if available) <br />3. Contract number and project title<br />4. Contract Type (e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, IDIQ, Requirements type)<br />5. Total contract value<br />6. Performance period (e.g. date/month/year through date/month/year)<br />7. Description of contract work performed<br />8. Contracting Officer's name and phone number<br />9. Government Inspector/commercial project manager and phone number<br />10. List of major subcontractors if applicable<br /><br />In addition, the offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts identified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) above and corrective actions taken to resolve these problems. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.</p>
<p>(2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire: The Government requires the Present/Past Performance Information of the contracts identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List from each contracting activity or commercial activities. The offeror shall send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire (See Solicitation Attachment # 5) to respective Points of Contact (POCs) of contracting activity identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List. The responsibility to send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity. Once the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire is completed by your POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be releasable. Present/Past Performance Questionnaire shall be sent directly back to 374 CONS/LGCB from evaluating agencies/companies, not later than 23 Apr 2012 by either e-mail eric.schmitt@yokota.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846. Offerors are responsible for ensuring that their reference sources receive the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire in time to complete and return the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire to 374th Contracting Squadron. No Present/Past Performance Questionnaire will be accepted directly from the offeror being evaluated. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>B. Present/Past Performance Evaluation:</p>
<p><br />(1) Present/Past Performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Recency: Each contract will be confirmed whether the contract has been completed during the past three years from this solicitation release date, or is currently in progress.</p>
<p>2. Relevancy: Submit information on contracts that you consider relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) may include the work requirement(s) listed in Description of Services under paragraph 1 of the PWS. A relevancy determination of the offeror's Present/Past Performance as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures, and/or teaming partners will be made. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy score for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply:</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved essentially the same scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved much of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved some of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort did not involve any of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>3. Quality: Quality Assessment is assigned based on the Quality Assessment Criteria below on the Present/Past Questionnaire (Solicitation Attachment # 4)</p>
<p>(1) Quality of Work<br />(2) Timely Performance/Schedule<br />(3) Effectiveness of Management for Resolution of Issues/Problems/Customer Complaints<br />(4) Compliance with the Applicable Rules, Regulations, Laws, including Safety Standards</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>

<p>MAJOR BREACH OF SAFETY OR SECURITY</p>
<p>(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and compliance with safety standards and practices is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</p>
<p>(b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information or sensitive security information or sensitive but unclassified information, including contractor proprietary information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.</p>
<p>NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition should not be confused with breach of security in screening operations.<br /><br />(c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>Cost or Pricing Data<br />It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>
<p>3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest JUN 2006</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest is unequal access to competitive useful nonpublic information.<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award. <br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: <br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational <br />conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. <br />(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. <br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. <br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. <br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Factor 1- Technical Capability<br />2. Factor 2- Experience<br />3. Factor 3- Past performance<br />4. Factor 4- Delivery<br />5. Factor 5- Price<br /><br />Technical Capability is the most important evaluation factor. Experience is the second most important evaluation factor. Past Performance is the third most important evaluation factor. Delivery is the fourth most important evaluation factor. Price is the least important evaluation factor.</p>
<p>All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology (IT) Team is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

All attending parties must be identified so security forms and gate clearances can be processed.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (FEB 2012), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are:</p>
<p>(b) Written proposals are due by 3:00 PM (EST) on 11 April 2012. Submit to: AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Bryant Soule, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>(b)(10) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors shall submit past performance information to include recent and relevant contracts which demonstrate the ability of the offeror to perform the proposed effort. Please provide past performance information for no more than five (5) relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. To the maximum extent practicable, identify contracts for properties which are not owned or operated by your firm or by key personnel, including intended subcontractors, of your firm. <br />Referenced past performance information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and a narrative explaining the contract's relevancy to the solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered RELEVANT, performance must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract efforts that required mowing, edging, trimming, pruning, policing, and leaf removal of a lawn area at least 10 acres in size.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror. Information may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov or 888-227-2423.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies. In addition to the information in paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) PRICE and (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE. After considering all past performance data gathered by the Government for this solicitation, an offeror's past performance will be assigned a confidence rating based on the list below:</p>
<p>-Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or a performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><br />The representations and certifications in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2012) and Alternate I (APR 2011) must be completed electronically on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>I. Description:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Government intends to award two contracts consisting of separate portions of the scope of effort comprising the comprehensive LISC acquisition: one contract comprising core LTRS Operations, Maintenance, and Sustainment activities (LISC OM&amp;S) (full and open competition), and one contract comprising LTRS Operations Support areas (LISC Ops Support) (small business set-aside). The purposes of this Sources Sought Synopsis are to (1) provide the opportunity for either large or small businesses, who may have / have not responded to the original Sources Sought Synopsis (issued on 28 Jul 09, amended for the change in NAICS code on 7 Jan 11), to submit Statements of Capability (SOCs) on the LISC OM&amp;S effort, and (2) request feedback regarding a LISC OM&amp;S small business subcontracting requirement of 22% of contract value.</p>
<p><br /><strong>II. LISC Operations, Maintenance, and Sustainment Contract:</strong></p>
<p>1. The contemplated LISC OM&amp;S contract is intended to provide the Government with a single prime contractor responsible and accountable for the following areas, as referenced in the attachment labeled LISC Draft Performance Work Statement V9 (LISC PWS) (dated 9 Dec 11, originally posted to the LISC Bidders' Library on 16 Dec 11 as part of the Draft RFP package):<br /><br />A. Perform Range Operations (LISC PWS Section 3.1)<br /><br />B. Operate Range instrumentation&nbsp; and assess Range instrumentation&nbsp;performance (LISC PWS Section 3.2)<br /><br />C. Perform Range Organizational Maintenance (LISC PWS Section 3.3)<br /><br />D. Maintain Range Systems through Depot-level Maintenance (LISC PWS Section 3.4)<br /><br />E.

Provide specialized support (LISC PWS Section 3.16, Tasks 3.16.1 and 3.16.3 - 3.16.7)</p>
<p>Organizational and depot maintenance responsibilities will be consistent with USAF &amp; AFSPC 2-level maintenance policies.</p>
<p>NOTE: The attached and referenced LISC PWS consists of the full scope of effort comprising the LISC acquisition.

However, any potential offerors may revise any previous SOC. This Sources Sought Synopsis will not be used to develop a bidders list. The NAICS code for this contract is 541330 - Engineering Services. Additionally, if teaming with other contractors is anticipated, list their names, business size, experience and capabilities for their allocated task areas, and the percentage of the work each team member will be responsible for including the prime.</p>
<p>3. The Government is considering a small business subcontracting requirement of 22% of total contract value for the LISC OM&amp;S contract. The Government requests industry feedback on whether or not this requirement can be achieved. As part of the SOC, or as an independent response, provide a description of how this requirement will be met.</p>
<p><br /><strong>III. Additional Instructions &amp; Information:</strong></p>
<p>1. The SOC shall not exceed 25 pages in total length. All responses must conform to 8.5x11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point and 1-inch margins (the SOC cover page / table of contents pages will not count against the page limit).

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Launch &amp; Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC)<br />Operations Support Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA)<br />Sources Sought Synopsis</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>I. Description:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Government intends to award two contracts consisting of separate portions of the scope of effort comprising the comprehensive LISC acquisition: one contract comprising core LTRS Operations, Maintenance, and Sustainment activities (LISC OM&amp;S) (full and open competition), and one contract comprising LTRS Operations Support areas (LISC Ops Support) (small business set-aside). The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to seek potential small business prime contractors for the LISC Ops Support effort.</p>
<p><br /><strong>II. LISC Operations Support Small Business Set-Aside Contract:</strong></p>
<p>1. The contemplated LISC Ops Support SBSA contract is intended to provide the Government with a single small business prime contractor responsible and accountable for the areas of Administrative Support Communications for Eastern Range (ER) &amp; Western Range (WR), Comptroller IT Support, and Elements of Downrange Base Operating Support (DBOS) for ER. Specifically, the contemplated LISC Ops Support contract effort is intended to consist of the following task areas as referenced in the attachment labeled LISC Ops Support Draft Performance Work Statement (Ops Support PWS):</p>
<p>A. Provide Mission Support Communications (Ops Support PWS Sections 3.1 &amp; 3.2)<br /><br />B. Provide Downrange Base Operating Support (DBOS) (ER Only) (Ops Support PWS Section 3.3)<br /><br />C. Provide Specialized Support (Ops Support PWS Section 3.4)</p>
<p>2. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine whether the contemplated LISC Ops Support scope could be set aside under NAICS Code 561210 - Facilities Support Services. Small businesses intending to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis are advised that the contemplated LISC Ops Support contract is intended to be a full set-aside to small business, and FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and be included in a resulting contract, wherein at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance shall be incurred for personnel of the small business prime. There are no provisions under FAR 15 or otherwise to allow small business primes to use their small business team members / subcontractors as part of the percentage. For clarity, the entity whose name appears on the contract is required to perform 50% using employees of that entity, whether they be a sole proprietor or a formal or informal joint venture.</p>
<p>3. Qualified sources should submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience and capability in any (A, B, or C) or all (A-C) of the anticipated task areas listed above and described in the attached LISC Ops Support PWS. As part of the SOC, potential Offerors should demonstrate their capability to perform these tasks across geographically-dispersed locations as outlined in the LISC Ops Support Draft PWS.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Government considers tasks included under Program Management Requirements (LISC Ops Support Draft PWS Section 2) to be standard requirements applicable to Government contracts. Respondents need not include these tasks in the SOC unless any portion of these requirements cannot be met.</p>
<p>Additionally, if teaming with other contractors is anticipated, qualified sources must list the other contractors' names, business sizes, experience and capabilities for their allocated task areas, and the percentage of the work for which each team member will be responsible, including the potential small business prime contractor.</p>
<p>4. The Government further requests industry feedback on the above approach. Specifically, the Government requests that industry provide recommendations for strategies and methods to maximize cooperation between the two potential LISC prime contractors (LISC OM&amp;S and LISC Ops Support) (e.g. incentive structures, clauses, Associate Contractor Agreements, or other methods) while minimizing mission assurance risk, inefficiencies, and redundancies.</p>
<p><br /><strong>III. Additional Instructions &amp; Information:</strong></p>
<p>1. The SOC shall not exceed 25 pages in total length. All responses must conform to 8.5x11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point and 1-inch margins (the SOC cover page / table of contents pages will not count against the page limit). This Sources Sought Synopsis is for market research only. Interested parties shall state the size of their business in regards to NAICS Code 561210 - Facilities Support Services.</p>
<p>2. Submit the SOC in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format via 2 CDs and one hard copy to the Contracting Officer Francis Whalen by the Response Due Date: 23 Apr 2012, 4:00 PM PDT.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Sources Sought<br>Protective Over Garment (POG)<br><br>BACKGROUND:  Product Manager - Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) is seeking sources and to collect information for the possible production of the Tier II - Protective Over Garment (POG).  The prevalence of IEDs during dismounted operations in Operation Enduring Freedom has caused a greater number of injuries to the lower body.  These include blast injuries surrounding the groin area affecting the colon, femoral artery, and genitalia.  The current Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) add-on groin protector equipment only offers protection from frontal threats.  PM SPE believes a two-tiered system will provide the optimal combination of protection and user acceptance. The Tier II - POG - part of the Pelvic Protection System - is an item that will provide protection against ground based IED threats.   The POG is worn over the Army Combat Uniform trousers and provides protection of the pelvis, femoral arteries, and lower abdominal organs in a blast or fragmentation event.  The POG will also reduce the penetration of dirt and fine debris into a wound area to prevent infections.<br><br> PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS:<br>At a minimum, the Tier II Protective Over Garment (POG):<br><br>- Shall consist of three (3) distinct areas of ballistic protection to provide an optimum balance of protection and mobility.

Wherever there is no continuous ballistic material, a minimum 1 in. overlap shall be maintained to prevent gaps in coverage.<br><br>- Front, center, and rear ballistic materials shall be removable/replaceable.<br><br>- Ballistic filler areal density of front and rear sections shall not exceed 1.10 lb/ft2 with a maximum 0.30 in. thickness.  Ballistic filler weight of center section shall not exceed 0.40 lb/ft2 with a maximum 0.10 in. thickness.<br><br>- Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  The system shall be compatible with currently fielded personal protective equipment and combat uniform and shall attach either to the body armor and/or the belt loops of the trousers.<br><br>- Front section shall be capable of being disconnected from the center/rear section and worn as a standalone item, with the option of fastening to the belt or Improved Outer Tactical Vest.  Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  <br><br>- Attachment point(s) connecting the front section to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 150 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br>- Attachment points/seams connecting the rear panel to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 600 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br><br>-	Shall be capable of donning and doffing without removing the belt from the Army Combat<br>Uniform trousers<br><br>-  Must be available in multiple sizes to fit 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male waist circumference.<br><br>- Outer facing cloth shall be constructed with the following camouflage pattern: US Army Operational Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP)<br><br>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Responses shall include the following information:<br>a.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT / GENERAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS SOUGHT<br />Reference No. 993</p>
<p><br />The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (hereinafter called The University), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a two-phase Construction Management/General Contractor (CM/GC) Lump Sum subcontract for preconstruction services and construction for the Building 84 Center for Isotope Geochemistry Renovation (B84 CIG) Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. It is an announcement of subcontracting opportunities with the University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Interested firms are encouraged to submit a prequalification package as indicated below.</p>
<p>The Building 84 Center for Isotope Geochemistry Renovation (B84 CIG) Project, a fast track design project, consists of the renovation of approximately 5,750 sf of existing labs on the second and third floors of Building 84 into two Class 1,000 clean labs, a Class 10,000 clean lab for mass spectrometry and several general purpose labs.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for CM/GCs wishing to submit their prequalification documents are:<br />1) Prospective CM/GC is required to have the following California contractor's license/classification: B GENERAL BUILDING CONTRACTOR.<br />2) Prospective CM/GC must have completed, as a general contractor, a minimum of 3 projects in the last 5 years, with a construction cost of more than $3 million each that are similar in scope and complexity to the project described herein.</p>
<p>Desired attribute:  Prospective CM/GC has maintained an average Workman's Compensation Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0 or less over the last 3 years.</p>
<p>Desired attributes:<br />3)	Prospective CM/GC has maintained an average Workman's Compensation Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0 or less over the last 3 years.</p>

<p>4)	CM/GC Offeror has construction experience at LBNL.<br />5)	Project experience with 2% or better duct air leakage construction and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testing<br />6)	Mechanical controls upgrades in existing buildings<br />7)	Experience with building commissioning<br />8)	Familiarity with "Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings"</p>
<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>The B84 CIG project includes the following renovation work on the approximately 20 year old building:  selective demolition of interior finishes, lab equipment, walls and utilities to suit new layout; construction of new clean rooms, general chemistry labs and mass spectrometer labs, including but not limited to temporary measures to serve existing occupants,  structural modifications, casework, finishes, plumbing modifications, fire sprinkler upgrades (fire sprinklers will be design/build by GC), mechanical upgrades, mechanical controls, energy management controls, lighting, electrical upgrades, tel/data modifications, life safety modifications, commissioning assistance, possible hazardous gas controls, and other upgrades that may be required to serve new labs and clean rooms. Additionally, the mechanical controls for the entire building may be upgraded during this project if the budget allows.</p>
<p>The building will be partially occupied during the construction. The work is also adjacent to main pedestrian walkways and other occupied structures. LBNL has very high standards for construction safety and will vigorously enforce all safety regulations. Therefore, contractors must have a proven record of safe performance on past construction projects.</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range:  The current estimated construction cost range is $4.1 to $4.9 million.</p>
<p>CM/GC SERVICES</p>
<p>The University desires to award a two-phase Subcontract. During Phase 1, the CM/GC will perform "design-assist" preconstruction services, which shall include, but not be limited to, all preconstruction services normally provided by Construction Management firms, such as  equipment recommendations, constructability and drawing completeness reviews, utility coordination reviews, site investigations, cost estimates, attendance at weekly meetings, design evaluation and proposed design alternatives, value engineering suggestions if required for possible future implementation, etc. Within two weeks of the architect/engineer's completion of 50, 95, and 100 percent design documents the CM/GC shall submit an independent written Project Construction Cost Estimate and a comprehensive Critical Path Method (CPM) schedule, showing all project related construction activities. The CM/GC work shall also include the preparation of subcontract packages and the conduct of competitive bidding for lower-tier subcontracted work.</p>
<p>If the University exercises an option for performance of Phase 2, the Subcontractor shall provide general building contractor services to construct the project, including, but not limited to, providing specified general condition items, safety management, subcontractor management, quality control, submittal and RFI processes, document control and change order management.</p>
<p>PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The University has determined that CM/GCs must be prequalified to submit a proposal for this project.<br />Prequalification will be determined by means of a written questionnaire, which all interested CM/GCs must complete accurately and submit for evaluation by the University, to establish the CM/GC's prequalification status. The University will establish a short list of firms determined to be most qualified to perform the project successfully. Prequalified firms will be invited to submit a comprehensive proposal to include both price and technical evaluation factors. A single firm will be selected for award, based on a best value evaluation of proposals received.</p>
<p>Prequalification documents consisting of this NOTICE TO CM/GCs FOR PREQUALIFICATION together with the PREQUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE will be available to intending CM/GCs beginning on April 3, 2012 at the following web site:  http://facilitiesprojects.lbl.gov/, under Reference No. 993. Submissions must be received by April 20 2012, at 5:00 PM PDT (revised due date).</p>

The SM-3 IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2020 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U. S. Homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. Homeland. The SM-3 Block IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO EXTEND THE POSTING DATE TO APRIL 19TH, 2012<br /><br />***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sontek/YSI Incorporated, of Olympia., WA for two 250KHz acoustic Doppler profilers and accessories.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS) needs to collect, analyze and distribute historical and real-time observations and predictions of water levels, coastal currents, and other metrological and oceanographic data. This purchase is for stationary mounted side looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) which provides information about currents critical for marine transportation within Humboldt Bay. They are being put in the area to improve the safety of marine transportation. Other products lack the particular features, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. This equipment is already in use in the field by CO-OPs personnel and contractors with training to calibrate and repair the systems. To introduce another system would require training of field personnel and contractors plus the added expense of purchasing additional parts to repair the systems at a cost to the Government. Therefore it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase the current equipment in use.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the needed services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within&nbsp;10 days after publication of this posting. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice has been revised to update the requirements and to combine with the procurement described under pre-solicitation notice N00024-12-R-5202.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract modification to the current Firm Fixed Price AN/SQQ-89 ASW Combat System Production contract with Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors (MS2), 497 Electronics Pkwy Bldg 5, Liverpool, NY 13088-6062.  This modification to contract N00024-07-C-5201 extends the award to support FY12FY13 AN/SQQ-89(V)15 and AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production requirements.  This modification will also allow for the procurement of SCN new construction and FY 12-13 OPN, for a total of nineteen (19) systems.
  This effort will provide integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) system components that will leverage state-of-the-art commercial engineering designs as intrinsic technology enablers and support the development of new technological capabilities for DDG 51 Class ships.  Furthermore, this procurement will provide for the integration of Government Furnished Equipment Software (GFES) into all configurations of the AN/SQQ-89(V)15 and AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat Systems while supporting the establishment of a common hardware and software baseline to provide system capability improvements on surface combatants.  
  
Lockheed Martin MS2 is responsible for the hardware and software integration, test, evaluation, production preparation and delivery of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 systems.
 NAVSEA intends to award a contract modification resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as Lockheed Martin is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the system to meet the Government's requirement within the time required. This announcement is published for information purposes only.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin directly.  

The AN/SQQ-89 program provides integrated Combat Management, Fire Control, Command and Control, and On-Board Training to enable surface ships to engage USW targets. The program concept embraces open-architecture methodology to expand sensor performance through the use of common software components to achieve cost effectiveness and system efficiency.
  The AN/SQQ-89(V) systems are comprised of integrated subsystems that provide USW search, detection, classification, and localization for surface ships in both littoral and open ocean environments.   AN/SQQ-89(V) variants provide major capability improvements through hardware and software upgrades using an Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process.  

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>MNIS Mission</p>
<p>&nbsp;The MNIS mission is to provide an information sharing environment enabling commanders to rapidly and effectively share and consume information from US coalition partners and Mission Partners (MPs) operating across the strategic, operational, and tactical continuum, to include potential federal, state, local, and tribal mission partners. This concept integrates joint force actions with agencies, non-governmental organizations, first responders, and private volunteer organizations within the U.S. as well as in a multinational environment, whether the U.S. is leading the operation or participating as a MP. The portfolio of projects accomplishes this through managing two of DoD's prominent information sharing networks, CENTRIXS and Pegasus ICI (Griffin), and by running a robust Combined Federated Battle Logistics Network (CFBLNet) as the coalition information sharing trials and assessments "sandbox" for evaluating new information sharing capabilities and products. Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) will establish efficiencies throughout the CENTRIXS network topology to enable improved management and capabilities for information sharing. The emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS), will establish a DoD-wide enterprise unclassified information sharing capability for users worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />MNIS Product Descriptions</p>
<p>. CENTRIXS provides multiple communities of interest to enable US, US Coalition Partners and MPs to share information securely and rapidly. CENTRIXS allows for the secure sharing operational/intelligence information in COIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;. CMNT - is intended to separate the CENTRIXS network from the SIPRNET to provide several enhancements such as the ability to monitor the network for security/availability, the ability to manage the bandwidth of individual CENTRIXS communities of interest and the ability to conduct maintenance on SIPRNET without affecting CENTRIXS services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;. Pegasus ICI (Griffin) provides the ability to connect National-to-National Command and Control (C2) systems for sharing and coordinating among a select group of Allies (commonly referred to as "Five Eyes" - US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Pegasus ICI (Griffin) currently provides email with attachments and Common Operational Picture sharing (tailored).</p>
<p>&nbsp;. CFBLNet provides a year-round network for R&amp;D at a Combined Secret Releasable accreditation level to meet the requirements for a secure test environment to support coalition research, development, testing and ongoing capabilities assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;. UISS - provides an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) is an umbrella term used to describe a set of independent and discrete networks or products that are separated by Communities of Interest (COI). CENTRIXS is the US global, secure, information system to support multinational operations with shared, combined command, control and intelligence information up to the SECRET Releasable (REL) level. CENTRIXS is installed in partner nation countries and their military forces after they establish their specific requirements and relate the requirements with the supporting U.S. Combatant Commands (COCOM). The basic mission of CENTRIXS is to support the secure sharing and exchanging of intelligence and operational information through reliable communications connectivity, data manipulation, and automated processes. CENTRIXS networks provide COCOM commanders with enterprise services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The standard CENTRIXS architecture consists of servers, applications and encryption systems to form an IP-based network. There are approximately over 90 such networks. The MNIS PMO currently has shared Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility for some of these networks with COCOMs. Current MNIS PMO and vendor services for CENTRIXS support is through an existing contract. This PWS will address FTE support for such work.</p>
<p>Most of the MNIS portfolio's operational capabilities are currently or will be operated at DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC). The Contractor under this requirement shall provide Tier FTE engineering and operations support in the Continental United States (CONUS), and may travel to several different Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations further detailed below. At the time of contract award, the Contractor must be capable of providing U.S. personnel currently exempt from foreign tax status as defined under the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) / Technical Expert Support Agreement (TESA) or other applicable foreign regulations (as determined by the governments of those countries within which the contractor shall be residing under this contract). The Government will aid the Contractor in facilitating this process. It is expected that the Contractor will be able to provide 80% of proposed FTE support no later than thirty days post award, and 100% of the FTE support no later than sixty days post award. The MNIS PMO is interested in an effective proposed staffing approach from the Contractor that can express an efficient staffing plan to meet the needs of the Government. Historically, there have been 40 FTEs supporting such work within the U.S. and at various COCOM (customer) locations around the world including JCMO (Tampa, FL), EUCOM (Stuttgart, Germany), PACOM (Oahu, Hawaii), AFRICOM (HQ, Stuttgart), CENTCOM (Tampa, FL, Kuwait, and Bahrain) STRATCOM (Tampa, FL, Suffolk, VA),SOUTHCOM (Miami, FL), NORTHCOM (Colorado Spring, CO), and Alexandria, VA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of this requirement is to provide On-Site, FTE MNIS capability support for a wide range of program management, technical, research and development, procurement and operations/maintenance services to support the operational and strategic use of MNIS capabilities. These objectives include:</p>
<p>. Providing operational users support and training of MNIS capabilities; answering their questions and making recommendations on meeting operational objectives with MNIS capabilties.</p>
<p>. Supporting integration and testing events and efforts from customer sites as required by the MNIS project office. This may include some installation and configuration activity on MNIS assets.</p>
<p>. Assisting MNIS technical teams on deployment of MNIS capabilities at customer locations. This may include network infrastructure and enterprise services and other MNIS portfolio capabilities as required.</p>
<p>. Assisting customers with Information Management and facilitation of data inputs in a standardized fashion on MNIS capabilities.</p>
<p>. Assisting MNIS PMO in obtaining customer feedback and input on MNIS capabilities. This feedback may be used to help MNIS adjust to changing environments and correcting deficiencies in MNIS capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This notice is amended as follows, please respond only to the information ABOVE the line in this notice(rev 2.0). The information below the line (Rev 1.0) was submitted on 3/26/12 at 13:58pm PST. This new notice supercedes the original posting.
<p>Rev 2.0:</p>
<p>Per request of the Joint Program Executive Office, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), the JTRS Reference Implementation Laboratory (JRIL), in coordination<br />with the Assistant Secretary to the Army for Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology (ASAAL&amp;T) System of Systems Integration Directorate (SOSI), will be hosting a Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Interoperability Quicklook (WIQ) and a Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Interoperability Quicklook (SIQ). Both the SIQ and the WIQ will be conducted in Phases. The first two Phases will be a laboratory event, Phase I will be the Performance Characterization evaluation and Phase II will be the Interoperability Characterization evaluation. The JRIL is also considering a Phase III, which will be a field event. The objective of the SIQ and the WIQ is to provide vendors the opportunity to test their platforms in a heterogeneous network, serve as a cost-effective risk reduction exercise, and be utilized within the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) decision criteria. SIQ and WIQ alignment with NIE events is as follows:</p>
<p>- WIQ Phase I will support NIE 13.1 Decision Point 2<br />- WIQ Phase II will support both NIE 13.1 Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) and NIE 13.2 Decision Point 1<br />- SIQ Phases I and II will support NIE 13.2 Decision Point 1<br />- SIQ/WIQ Phase III (if exercised) will support NIE 13.2 Decision Point 2</p>
<p>WIQ<br />The WNW RIL will host the WIQ. The WIQ Phases I and II laboratory event will be held at the Space and Naval Warfare System Center (SSC) Atlantic WNW RIL at Charleston, SC. WIQ Phase III (if exercised) will be held at a location TBD. The WIQ is expected to include JTRS Program of Record (PoR) and non-JTRS PoR developers that are willing to provide suitable (i.e., suitable for integration and field use) systems including WNW 4.0.5.1 that are compliant with the WNW RIL Configuration Capability Package (CCP) along with necessary support personnel.</p>
<p>Current Performance Characterization testing to be conducted at SSC-LANT on 9 April 2012 will be credited to vendors for WIQ Phase I. Phase I is expected to last two weeks. WIQ Phase II to be conducted at SSC-LANT starting on 23 April 2012 will focus on Interoperability Characterization. Phase II will be accomplished in two parts. Phase II, Part A will include multi-vendor<br />heterogeneous network testing with COMSEC disabled (BLACK I/O). Phase II, Part B will include multi-vendor heterogeneous network testing with TRANSEC and COMSEC enabled (Red I/O). Phase II is expected to last two weeks. WIQ Phase III (if exercised) will be a two-week field event. Testing for all Phases will provide an evaluation of each vendor's level of WNW functionality and interoperability. Evaluation will also include stability and functionality in a multi-vendor heterogeneous network. Further functionality and performance testing can be requested from the WNW RIL through a Commercial Service Agreement (CSA) 2539(b). A number of test cases will be designed, documented in<br />the test plan and offered to participants at the event. Participants will be permitted to select the tests in which they wish to participate. Results of testing will be provided to the JPEO JTRS and SOSI, but analysis of a particular vendors testing will not be provided to other vendors and proprietary information will be protected.</p>
<p>The JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) will be used to create configurations for the AN/VRC-107 radio and a plain-text version of the Radio Mission Data set (RMDS) will be distributed to all participants for evaluation<br />and integration prior to the test event.</p>
<p>In order to participate in testing, vendors will be required to have met the following set of entrance criteria:<br />- WNW 4.0.5.1 Capable Radio that is compliant with the WNW RIL Configuration Capability Package (CCP)<br />- TRANSEC Implementation<br />- WNW HAIPE Implementation is required to participate in Phase II Part B and Phase III<br />- Red-to-Red Communication is required to participate in Phase II Part B and Phase III<br />- Red and/or Black Key Implementation</p>
<p>If a vendor is interested in testing but cannot meet the entrance criteria as stated above, please contact Brett Bendt for further information.</p>
<p>Interested parties should contact Brett Bendt at SSC-LANT<br />(brett.bendt@navy.mil) no later than 30 March 2012 to register for attendance. Parties having questions should direct those questions to Bryan Glover,<br />Contract Specialist, at bryan.glover@navy.mil and Diane Thornewell, PCO, at diane.thornewell@navy.mil. Interested parties will be provided the Software Test Plan for the upcoming WIQ.</p>
<p><br />SIQ<br />The SRW RIL will host the SIQ. The SIQ Phases I and II laboratory event will be held at the CERDEC S&amp;TCD SRW RIL at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. SIQ Phase III (if exercised) will be held at a location TBD. The SIQ is expected to include JTRS Program of Record (PoR) and non-JTRS PoR developers whom are willing to provide suitable (i.e., suitable for integration and field use) systems including SRW 1.1.1 that are compliant with the SRW RIL Configuration Capability Package (CCP) along with necessary support personnel.</p>
<p>SIQ Phase I to be conducted at CERDEC S&amp;TCD will focus on Performance Characterization. Given the number of potential vendor radios under test, Phase I will be broken into two, two-week increments. The first increment (14 May to 25 May) will include the first set of vendor radios to be tested with the option of vendor checkouts in the lab starting 7 May 2012. The second increment (4 June to 15 June) will include the second set of vendor radios to be tested with the option of vendor checkouts in the lab starting 29 May 2012.

<DESC>The following meeting minutes are for information purposes only. Any question, comments or concerns shall be addressed at https://www.projnet.org.<br><br>PRE-PROPSOSAL MEETING<br>West Palm Beach Army Reserve Center<br>West Palm Beach, FL<br>7 July 2011<br><br>1. The pre-proposal meeting was held at the Lake Park Town Hall, 535 Park Avenue, Lake Park, FL. Registration started at 9am local time and the presentation started at 10am local time.<br>Project Overview (Diane McCartin) <br>2. Diane McCartin/LRL PM welcomed everyone to the meeting. It was explained that Louisville US Army Corps of Engineers (LRL) was the Center of Expertise for the Army Reserve program and they managed projects all over the country. The LRL staff is involved throughout the design and construction.<br>3. Diane McCartin introduced the Government team and introduced Greg Hales as the permanent USACE Project Manager. The USACE team made introductions around the room. Diane McCartin also thanked the local officials for allowing the use of the Town Hall for the meeting.<br>4. This project was coordinated with the Florida Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) and advertised on the FedBizOpps website in an effort to get the widest distribution.<br>5. The minutes and list of attendees will be posted on FedBizOpps as a Special Notifice. Questions during the meeting should be submitted index cards that were distributed and will be responded to in the Special Notifice posted on FedBizOpps.<br>6. Diane McCartin reviewed the agenda. A site visit will be conducted.<br>7. When the team returns from the site visit, an attempt will be made to response to all questions that were asked. Responses to all questions will be posted on FedBizOpps.<br>8. This is an FY10 DOD Grow the Army (GTA) project. The project will utilize a combination of Military Construction (MILCON) and Operation Maintenance and Repair (OMAR) funds. MILCON includes bricks and mortar (real property) and OMAR consists of items that are considered as "personal property" such as special equipment or furniture. These funding streams must be bid separately as MILCON is a 5 year appropriation and OMAR is 1 year. The Price Breakout Schedule is structured to capture these different appropriations.<br>9. There is a target ceiling in the RFP at $17,406,000 which applies to the MILCON portion of the project. OMAR does not have a target ceiling.<br>10. Bubble diagrams were included in the RFP. This project is a pilot project for the Army Reserve program and included a Design Build "Lite" concept. Most government RFPs are more prescriptive than typical private sector. Over the course of the past few years, the Army Reserve has been moving towards less prescriptive. This includes bubble diagrams only to show functional adjacencies.<br>11. Recent Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) projects have had lots of creativity which has improved upon the conceptual floorplan.<br>12. The Project Delivery Team encourages award winning, impressive projects. The project should take on a campus-type feel (ARC, OMS and UHS). Bidders are encouraged to use some creativity, while staying within budget.<br>13. Diane McCartin also mentioned that while the city does not have overall jurisdiction, the USACE tries to be a good neighbor and will be submitting all design packages to the city for comments. In past projects, the USACE has found that the city provides great comments that are incorporated into the final design package.<br>14. Proposals are due by 4 Aug 2011 at 11am Eastern Time and prices must be good for 90 days.<br>RFP Overview (Greg Hales)<br>15. The users of the facility will be the 937th Engineer Company and the 236th Cargo Transfer Company. There will be a couple smaller Quartermaster units as well. The facility will have up to 600 personnel assigned and 3 weekends/month of drilling. No more than 207 personnel on the maximum drill weekend and 15-30 full-time personnel. There will be combination civilian and military personnel that utilize the facility.<br>16. The main mission of the complex is to training personnel in preparation of a deployment and to store equipment. <br>RFP Overview (Tracey Spielmann)<br>17. The RFP package contained two Volumes of Specifications.<br>a. Volume 1 of the specifications included attachments containing bubble diagrams for the buildings and an existing site conditions drawing. No floorplans were included in the RFP package.<br>b. Volume 2 of the specifications (Div 2-48) contains outline specifications that were not edited. These specifications will be further developed by the DB contractor during the design phase.<br>18. The project must meet the requirements set forth by the UFCs, to include Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), and all permitting and regulatory requirements. Some important references include: UFC 4-010-01 (Antiterrorism Standards), UFC 4-171-05 (Army Reserve Facilities Design Guide), Army Reserve Design Process and Submittal Requirements Manual (Part C). These documents can be found on the LRL website.<br>19. The project includes an Army Reserve Center (ARC) Training facility, Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS), Unheated Storage (UHS), washrack and site improvements. <br>20. The project is required to be certified by GBCI as LEED Silver at a minimum. The project is currently registered under LEED, Version 2.2, and the registration number was included in the RFP.<br>21. The project includes 13 options described in Section 00010 to include several sustainability options in an attempt to create a project as close to a net-zero impact as possible for energy consumption for the project.<br>22. An overview of the project considerations was discussed. <br>a. A state-listed endangered giant wild pine (bromeliad-air plant living in the oak tree) is on the project site. Construction should avoid this oak tree.<br>b. A small portion of the NE corner of the site is located in the 100-year floodplain. This area must not be impacted by construction.<br>c. Permits are required to fill Finger Lake.<br>d. The Military Equipment Parking (MEP) and OMS shall be screened from Congress Ave by landscaping materials that meet AT/FP.<br>e. Locate the main fa ade of the facility along Congress Ave, place the MEP and OMS behind to screen from Congress Ave.<br>f. The ARC and the OMS must follow the Mizner style of architecture. <br>23. A brief overview of the utility and permitting agencies associated with the project site was presented (these are included on the attached slides) <br>24. A brief overview of the bubble diagrams for the Army Reserve Center, Organizational Maintenance Shop and Unheated Storage were presented. <br>25. The components of each proposed facility were briefly described.<br>Proposal Instructions to Bidders (Misty Jones)<br>26. This project is a Set Aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.<br>27. The Target Ceiling for award is $17,406,000.<br>28. This is a Best Value/Tradeoff procurement.<br>29. All questions must be submitted in ProjNet. This allows everyone to see all the questions/answers. Instructions on the use of ProjNet are included in the solicitation.<br>30. Bidders should submit the best proposal and not assume there will be discussions.<br>31. Bid Bonds are not required.<br>32. Do not include extra "fluff" in the RFP. The USACE is confined to only evaluate what was required in the RFP; therefore, bidders should focus on these items.<br>33. Proposals are due by 4 August 2011 at 1100am Eastern Time.<br>34. The bidders must sign the SF 1442 and acknowledge all amendments.<br>35. If the bidder is a Joint Venture, the JV must provide a copy of the agreement as well as DUNS and CCR information for each party comprising the JV.<br>36. Teaming agreements and Subcontractors will not be evaluated as Prime Contractor experience.<br>37. Section 00114 stipulates the requirements for proposals. This section specifically defines proposal elements to be evaluated and the evaluation process.<br>38. Submit 7 Copies and 1 Original for technical information (Volume I) and 1 CD/DVD.<br>39. Submit 1 original for pricing (Volume II).<br>40. Volume I tabs/evaluation criteria are listed in order of importance<br>41. Minimum requirements must be met to be considered for award. Missing data will result in an unacceptable proposal.<br>42. Preferences are not required but increase the value of the proposal.<br>43. The Period of Performance is 490 days. <br>44. Attendees of pre-proposal meeting will be posted by special announcement to FBO. <br>45. Specifically state how much was self-performed on the projects that are listed in the proposal. <br>Design Process (Tara O'Leary)<br>46. Review the "Design Process and Submittal Requirements Manual" (Part C)<br>47. The Charette is the first step, followed by Interim Submittal, Final Submittal, Corrected Final and Certified Final.<br>48. The Army Reserve uses "interim" versus calling out certain percentages. The submittal manual outlines what is required for each discipline.<br>49. This solicitation allows for fast tracking. This allows a final civil/structural package to be submitted with the interim building package. It is up to the Contractor to decide if fast tracking is utilized and what portions of the design are fast tracked.<br>50. Once the Certified Final package is accepted, a Release for Construction will be provided, the Contractor may proceed with only those portions of the design included in the Certified Final package.<br>51. Even if there is a Release for Construction, an error or omission in the design discovered later must be addressed.<br>52. A compliance review will be conducted on the design. CH2M HILL will be doing this as well as the USACE field office, LRL USACE reviewers, and multiple communications agencies.<br>53. Dr. Checks is used to track all comments and responses. DrChecks is an online system within ProjNet that is similar to the Bidder Inquiry system.<br>54. There are requirements for licensed engineers. Civil Engineer must be registered in FL. A Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) is required. Interior designer must be National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) certified.<br><br>55. A Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) which includes the Structural Interior Design (SID) and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment ( FFE) is required. The requirements are very detailed in the specification.<br>56. LRL procures and installs the furniture; however, the designer will design and layout the furniture. The vendor will be Knoll.<br>57. Furniture and IT installation occurs during the 490 day construction contract duration. Final connections are made by Contractor.<br>58. The 490 day duration includes all time for design, permitting, construction, and furniture install. The facility must be ready for furniture 42 days prior to construction completion date.<br>59. The schedule Section in the RFP called the "The Design Build Process" is not intended to be the actual schedule, but rather to show the milestones for planning purposes. Times indicated for government review cannot be shortened. A project schedule will be required per the RFP after contract award.<br>Construction (Dennis Newell)<br>60. Dennis Newell is from the USACE Mobile District and has a lot of experience in FL. He will serve as the geographic construction district lead. LRL will take the lead on the design role and Mobile will take the lead for the construction.<br>61. One requirement is to provide the Government a trailer on the site. The USACE will be sitting on the site day to day doing quality assurance. The project will be using the QCS program. There is a specification section that discusses this. It tracks submittals, RFIs, payments, etc...<br>62. Dennis Newell mentioned that the project will be "good neighbors". This project needs to set stage for the soldiers. The USACE and their partners want to be proponents of the city. Dennis discussed the importance of safety while working and living in this community.<br>63. Permitting is required. This needs to be completed within the 490 day contract duration.<br>64. Safety: Review EM-385 1-1. Get familiar with it as this will be enforced by the USACE. In several occasions this will exceed OSHA standards. Bottom-line: we don't want anyone getting hurt.<br>65. A Geotechnical investigation is required. This is a new site.<br>Question/Answers (Tara O'Leary and Misty Jones)<br>66. Q: Can CH2M HILL bid on this project? A: No<br>67. Q: Is there a code of silence on this project? A: CH2M HILL is not allowed to answer questions regarding the project or RFP. All questions/answers must be submitted through ProjNet.<br>68. Q: Is the Washrack SF part of OMS SF? It was mentioned as separate in the brief. A: The washrack must be separated from the OMS and it is not included in the OMS square footage.<br>69. Q: It says that funds subject to availability per RFP. Have funds been allocated and are they available? A: Yes, this is an FY10 project and funds are available for the MILCON portion<br>70. Q: Will we be able to have a copy of today's PowerPoint? A: Yes, it will be provided with the meeting minutes<br>71. Q: Are the plans in original RFQ are still valid or only bubble diagrams? A: The conceptual floorplans were removed with Amendment #2. The bubble diagrams are still valid.<br>72. Q: Are there room finish specification? This is relative to countertop materials. A: This specification will be developed during the design phase and specific materials will be included in the CID package. UFC 4-171-05 also has basic requirements for room finishes.<br>73. Q: Is the USACE bidding for testing and inspections, or is the DB firm responsible for this scope? A: The Design Build firm is responsible. <br>74. Q: Will pre-engineered metal building be acceptable for use on the Training Building and OMS facilities. A: No, please refer to Para 6.2.1.1.4 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>75. Q: It was mentioned that only the prime contractor's past experience will be considered and teaming partner's experience will not be considered. Does this apply to design team experience as well (ie. design team experience will not be considered)? A: The design team is evaluated separately and their past experience will be considered.<br>76. Q: Is parking lot geometry restricted by the 148' AT/FP standoff demarcation live? Would 82' ATFP be adequate? A: 148' is for conventional construction per UFC 4-010-01. This can be reduced to 82' if the building is hardened; however 148' is preferred.<br>77. Q: Is CADD platform AutoCAD or Rivet acceptable in lieu of Microstation? A: Microstation is a contract requirement as referenced in 00 80 00.00 06 Para 1.10.2.a.1 and 01 03 00.00.48 Para 1.5.4.<br>78. Q: What is meant by fast track civil submittal? A: The contractor can skip interim design submittal and go straight to final design with the structural/civil package to gain a faster Release for Construction on the site work.<br>79. Q: Is it anticipated that gas will be required? A: Yes, per Para 3.7.4 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>80. Q: Does UHS bldg require air conditioning/humidity control?

Q: Will this project include meeting all force protection requirements (UFC 3-010-01. A: Yes, compliance with UFC 4-010-01 is required in Part 2 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>88. Q: As a staffing agency, what is the bidding process going to include? A: The solicitation is posted at fbo.gov and contains the proposal requirements<br>89. A: How do we submit bids for skilled and unskilled labor? A: There is an interested vendor list on fbo.gov. This would be arranged through the Prime Contractor.<br>90. Q: A topographical survey of the existing site has not been provided in the RFP drawings. Will one be provided? A: A topographic survey was included as Attachment D to the 01 02 00.00 48 and the native file was issued with Amendment 2.<br>91.

Q: Are there any companies eliminated from participating on a DB team? A: The Prime Contractor must be a SDVOSB.<br>93. Q: What are the min qualifications you are working from for small business? A: See Section 00114.<br>94. Q: For bonding purposes, if a qualified SDVOB GC does not have the required bonding capacity are we able to JV w/ a larger GC as long as it is approved by SBA? A: See Notes in Section 00114 with Para 4.3 and 5.1.1.A.<br>95. Q: Are there 8a and woman owned goals? A: Section 700 clause 52.222-23 reference goals for participation for minorities and women owned. A formal subcontracting plan is not required.<br>96. Q: Since a small business cannot JV with a large business and still qualify as a SDVOSB. How to you expect to get adequate competition in a project this size? A: A market survey was conducted which showed there was adequate competition available <br>97. Q: What is the rationale for not allowing evaluation of teaming<br>arrangement? A: Per FAR 9.602, it is the determination of the Louisville District. As stated in the solicitation, we are evaluating the experience and past performance of the prime contractor, i.e., the contractor identified in Block 14 of the Standard Form 1442, and the party with whom the Government will have contractual privity for purposes of performing this contract. If a contractor wishes to form a teaming arrangement in which the participants form a legal relationship such as a partnership or joint venture that itself can be considered the prime contractor, the experience and past performance of those partnership or JV partners will be considered. Please note that any such arrangement must be done in accordance with SBA's regulations on affiliation and joint ventures.<br><br>98. Q: How many SDVOSB's have built a reserve center here in the US? A: Unknown; however, government awards of previous projects may be found on fbo.gov.<br>99. Q: What are the minimum acceptable dollar values and SF requirements for similar project size as stated in section 00114 page 12/172 Para 5.1.1. A: See Para 5.1.1.A-similar to this project.<br>100. Q: Is the 490 days stated on SF 1442 the total design and construction or just construction duration? A: It includes design and construction.<br>101. Q: The solicitation seems to eliminate the potential for smaller SDVOSB's to form a team with large more experience contractors to pursue this project. Is this in accordance with FAR 9.6 which allows team and the use of all companies' quals and key personnel? A: FAR 9.602 states "teaming arrangement may be desired"; however, it is a business decision by the LRL that teaming arrangements are not desired. SDVOSBCs may team with the company of its choosing. However, offerors are reminded that any such arrangement must be done in accordance with SBA's regulations on affiliation. For purposes of evaluating prime contractor experience and past performance, we are evaluating the experience and past performance of the prime contractor, i.e., the contractor identified in Block<br>14 of the Standard Form 1442.<br><br>102. Q: I own a service connected disabled business. We make uniforms. Is there an opportunity to provide uniforms to contractors working on this project? A: See FBO for a list of interested vendors and contract contractors regarding uniforms. <br>103. Q: Will we be held accountable to 1 Safety Official and 1 CQCM? A: See specification 01 35 26 00.00 06 Para 1.6.1.1.a. The SSHO shall have no other duties. See spec 01 45 04 10.00.06 Para 3.5.2.c. The CQCM shall have no other duties.<br>104. Q: Does survey show all utility stubs and connections? A: The survey shows all existing conditions at site.<br>105. Q: How are you getting around FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(IV) and FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) stated below:<br><br>Past Performance<br>(iii) The evaluation should take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. <br><br>A: FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) provides examples of past performance information that can be taken into consideration, if such information is considered relevant to the instant acquisition. Such information was not considered relevant to this acquisition.<br><br>If an offeror has no similar or otherwise relevant experience that may be used for evaluation of past performance, this factor will be considered neutral, having no favorable or unfavorable impact on the offeror's evaluation, in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv).<br><br>106. Q: Does the SDVOSB Firm need to be CVE verified? A: No, certification and registration is through SBA via CCR<br>107. Q: In synopsis dated Jun 8 in scope of work, there called for a security system. Should we interpret security system to read mass notification system: meaning, should we be thinking of the standard Monaco security which includes fire? A: Please refer to UFC 4-171-05 for mass notification requirements. The USACE does not specify a vendor.<br>108. Q: Will SIPRnet be part of the requirements? A: Refer to UFC 4-171-05 and Parts 1 and 10 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>109. Q: Do we need Lake Park Building Permits? A: Federal projects do not require local building permit<br>110. Q: Is water retention a wetland preserve? A: No, per the EA, the site does not contain wetlands.<br>111. Q: Is SFWM Permit required for lake fill? A: Yes as shown in Para 3.4.9 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>112. Q: Does 450 days include full design and permitting if necessary? A: The duration is 490 days for full design and construction. See Para 1.3 of Section 00 80.00 06.<br>113. Q: When does the time start? A: At NTP. See Para 1.3.1(c) of Section 00 80 00.00 06.<br>114. Q: Will turning lane north bound be required? A: This needs to be coordinated with the city and FDOT per Para 3.7.1 of Section 01 02 00.00 48.<br>115. Q: Does Finger Lake drain Wal-Mart and/or Congress Ave? A: Please see Para 1.7.4.1 of Section 01 02 00.00 48 has a description of the lake and the permit required<br>116. Q: The Environmental assure Phase I is complete. Is there a need to obligate for Phase II? A: Per the Environmental Assessment (EA), Phase II is not required.<br>117. Q: It appears that water runoff from creek to lake is engineered storm runoff from street to lake. Do we need to maintain same volume of water in underground storage? A: Correct. Street runoff is conveyed to lake system through "creek" or Finger Lake as called in RFP. Relocation of the "creek" shall be designed in accordance with SFWMD requirements.<br>118. Q: It appears that the creek is wetland, true or false? If so, in prelim talk with city, county and state of FL, are they in a general agreement to disrupt site? A: Finger Lake as called in RFP is not a wetland as per EA assessment<br>119. Q: In LRL, what program do you work from? Prima 3 or Prima 6? A: Either.

<DESC>Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV 1.1) Pre-Solicitation Announcement
<p>Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>U.S. Special Operations Command, Headquarters Procurement Division, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5323</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement has a requirement to purchase a Non-Development Item (NDI) vehicle with Special Operations Forces (SOF) peculiar modifications. This vehicle will be a highly mobile, C/MH-47 transportable platform with associated manuals, spare parts, mechanical/operator training, and a Government furnished C4ISR suite. This procurement will be accomplished using full and open competition with the intent of awarding a seven year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type of contract, issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) delivery orders. Offerors will be required to provide a product sample as part of the proposal. The sample vehicle is not required to be fully production representative, however it must demonstrate that it is a mature design and with minor engineering effort, capable of meeting the production requirement. It is the Government's intent to release a Request for Proposal (RFP), H92222-12-R-0003, which will be posted on this FEDBIZOPPS (FBO) website in the weeks following this announcement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement&nbsp;is 336112,&nbsp;with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. A small business subcontracting plan is required for all offerors that do not meet the small business size standards under this NAICS.<br /><br />In order to be granted explicit access to the RFP package, Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) under at least one of the following NAICS codes: 336112, 336992, 336111, 336120, or 336999.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).</p>
<p>This synopsis shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information. No other program information related to total dollars available, total quantity of vehicles authorized, or timeline for official solicitation is available at this time, other than as provided below. USSOCOM will continue to post information in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to FBO after finalization of the acquisition documents.</p>
<p>The Government has received recurring questions and comments from Industry relative to the Ground Mobility Vehicle Program. This announcement will address the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Budget<br />2. Quantities of Vehicles to be procured</p>
<p>Budget: The recurring questions have been regarding the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 and FY2013 President's Budget position, and its effect on the GMV1.1 acquisition. The Government will not address specific dollar figures by year. However, there are Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds planned for this effort in FY12 and FY13, followed by procurement funds planned beginning in FY14.</p>
<p>Quantities of Vehicles to be procured: USSOCOM has an approved Capability Production Document (CPD) that requires 1297 GMV1.1 vehicles to achieve Full Operational Capability.</p>
<p>While questions are welcomed, the Government will not be providing answers to any further questions. If, after release of the final RFP, your question remains unanswered, please re-submit through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>Presently, the RFP requires Product Samples to be delivered no later than 31 May 2012.</p>
<p>The Government intends to hold a Pre-Proposal conference on 26 April 2012 in Tampa, FL. Further details will be contained in the final RFP.</p>
