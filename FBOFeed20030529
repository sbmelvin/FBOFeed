<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure technical and programmatic support services on a sole source basis from Center For Public Service Communications (CPSC), Arlington, Virginia.  The National Library of Medicine’s Specialized Information Service (SIS) Division provides environmental health and toxicology information to health care providers, medical librarians, professionals in health agencies, and other health organizations. SIS provides the information through specialized databases focusing on toxicology, chemical and HIV/AIDs information, publications, and a variety of community outreach initiatives. The main goal of the proposed work is to increase awareness and use of NLM’s medical and health information products and services, especially within minority and other special populations in order to strengthen and modernize biomedical research, training and applications and reduce health disparities. Task 1:  Identify opportunities to increase awareness and use of SIS information, databases and other services and “products” among minority and other special populations. Task 2:  Provide technical and programmatic support in support of SIS outreach projects, including the Environmental Health Information and Outreach Project, Tribal projects, international projects, and outreach and health information technology initiatives of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Health Professions Schools and other special populations. When necessary, and on behalf of SIS, conduct or participate in assessments of these programs. Task 3:  Provide technical and programmatic support to SIS in collaboration with other federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Office of Global Health Affairs, and the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth. CPSC is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks by virtue of the knowledge, expertise and experience it has acquired. CPSC has provided guidance and expertise to public and private sector clients in the highly specialized fields of applying telecommunications and information technologies in health, education and other public services. Further, CPSC possesses an historical perspective unmatched by other organizations or individuals. It would be hard to find another organization with CPSC’s proven depth of knowledge of U. S. and international telehealth and humanitarian assistance issues and contacts with in all levels of the fields. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for one (1) each 1W two-stage single mode ytterbium fiber amplifier optimized for a pulsed input signal at 1040 nm.  Bench-top version with microprocessor control managing automatic power control (APC) or automatic current control (ACC) mode, alarms, and status indicators.  RS-232 interface capability on rear panel.  Specifications to include: wavelength of operation:  1040 nm; average input power:  -3dBm&lt;pin&lt;+13dbm; output power:  &gt;1W (Pin&gt;-3dbm); Input isolation: &gt;20db; no output isolator; output spatial mode: fundamental mode.  Both fiber ends must be fully available (non-spliced or unsplit) for low loss input and output.   NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Keopsys, Inc. 96 Route 173W, Hampton, VA.  Keopsys is the creator of a patented VSP, or V-groove, pumping technique.  It is the only company which uses this pumping technology which allows precise side-pumping of small volumes of gain along the fiber length.  V-groove pumping has 2 major advantages over the other available techniques (end pumping and macro side pumping).  One, the fiber amplifier end faces are completely free of splitters, splices, or coupling optics, and off low loss coupling into and out of the amplifier; and Two, by pumping small volumes of gain material along the fiver, stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) is greatly minimized which can cause catastrophic feedback and optical damage in the system.  This system is required for our laser risk reduction efforts. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 16, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The USPS has a fleet of 1086 Advanced Facer Canceler Systems (AFCS) at USPS Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DC) throughout the country.  The AFCS is a mail handling system that faces letter mail by locating the stamp, meter, or indicia.  The AFCS also cancels letter mail, sprays an identification (ID) tag, lifts the image, and sorts letter mail to a set of bins for further processing.  Individual mail pieces are picked-off at the Feeder of the AFCS at a throughput rate of approximately 36,000 mail pieces per hour.  On occasion, the Feeder picks off more than one mail piece at a time resulting in what is termed as a “Double Feed.”  A double feed requires additional handling downstream of the mail distribution process because at some point the extra mail piece of the double feed is rejected by mail processing equipment or letter carrier.  The rejected mail piece of the double feed will need to be reintroduced into the mail distribution process.  This additional handling adds costs and decreases service performance for the USPS.  Therefore, the USPS requires a Double Detector that can be added onto the AFCS to detect and reject double feed in order to eliminate the additional handling required downstream of the mail distribution process.
The Postal Service intends to perform a competitive test to determine if performance described in the technical design requirements of the Statement of Work is achieved. This will be a limited competition with three prequalified suppliers, (1) Omron Electronics LLC, One Common Drive, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-5302, (2) Siemens Dematic Postal Automation L.P., PO Box 95080, Arlington, TX 76005-1080, and (3) Wessex Technology, Victory House, Somers Road North, Portsmouth, PO1 IPJ, UK. 
   Any firms interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact these firms directly. In conjunction with the competitive test, proposals will be submitted in response to the production requirements. The Postal Service intends to award one firm fixed price contract for the total quantity to the prequalified supplier who offers the best value to the Postal Service, based on established evaluation criteria. Any other supplier who has proven technology already in production and is interested in participating in the competitive test of the AFCS-Doubles Detector Program must email their request for a copy of the technical design requirements no later than Friday, June 6, 2003. In order to be favorably considered for inclusion on our prequalified list for this requirement, the supplier must submit two fully functional prototypes, suggested/required spare parts, and technical documentation (i.e. technical description, installation instructions, user documentation) to the USPS no later than Thursday, July 3, 2003. The competitive test will be conducted in both a Lab and Field environment during the July/August timeframe. Each supplier will be required to provide technical resources to install, debug, and burn-in their unit. The USPS will provide a minimum of one (1) week notice to each supplier prior to the installation date.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that it is in the its best interest to make a single source award to Booz-Allen and Hamilton. The objective of this anticipated contract is to define and validate an initial Concept of Use for en route sector modernization that addresses human performance and information integration/management.   The determination that Booz-Allen and Hamilton should receive the single source contract is due to Booz-Allen and Hamiton's current knowledge and experience gained in the performance of an independent assessment of the Air Traffic Services Human Factors programs.  This assessment includes human factors work for en route sector modernization, planned human factors research and analysis, potential benefits, and potential gaps/risks and risk mitigation strategies. Further, Booz Allen and Hamilton's experience has provided the firm with unique insights that can be applied in the development of the concept of use. This unique insight is necessary to develop the concept of use and create an animated mockup that can be used by FAA systems engineers.

<DESC>The objectives are to 1.Implement the surrogate safety assessment methodology in a stand-alone prototype software.2.Evaluate its sensitivity and validate it with field data.Scope:The initial efforts of this project will define and display surrogate measures of safety for intersections, identify data requirements from existing traffic simulation models, and coordinate accessibility and interfaces with software vendors.  Based on a set of  “mandatory” software design requirements in FHWA-RD-03-050, a code will be developed to extract required data from traffic simulation software and compute surrogate safety measures.  Sensitivity analysis and theoretical validation will be conducted to validate the model using existing crash models and crash modification factors.  Then a field calibration and validation study will be conducted to further evaluate the model using primarily crash and possibly conflict data.  If the validation is promising, a prototype model should be improved to include all specifications defined as “important” software requirements in FHWA-RD-03-050. The model shall be tested again and a final report written to describe the full effort, including software design and coding documentation, validation efforts, and user manual.

<DESC>The proposed contract is total set aside for small business concerns. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336411 and its size for small business is less than 1,500 employees.  The basic award period of this acquisition is for, Phase-In, a basic period, and four one-year options.  The contract will also include an additional five years of Award Term/Incentive Options that may also be exercised.  The requirement is for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the U.S. Government C-20 fleet of 21 Gulfstream III, IV, and IVSP aircraft as described in the following paragraphs.  These aircraft belong to the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and are designated C-20A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H.  These aircraft are FAA certified and maintained commercial aircraft modified to meet DoD requirements in various specific configurations, and are powered by Rolls Royce Spey or Tay engines.  The C-20 aircraft are located at five Main Operating Bases (MOBs): Ramstein AB GE (C-20H), NAS Sigonella IT (C-20A), Hickam AFB HI (C-20E), Marine Corp Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay HI (C-20G), and Andrews AFB MD 
(C-20B/D/E/F/G).  The aircraft at Ramstein, Sigonella, Hickam, Kaneohe Bay and Army C-20s at Andrews AFB are supported by full CLS (supply and organizational maintenance).  Partial CLS (supply support only) is provided for Navy and Air Force C-20s at Andrews AFB.  The Navy provides their own organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB and the Air Force replaces their organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB with a base contractor that is not associated with this contract.  Spare parts and support equipment maintained in the Contractor Operated and Maintenance Base Supply (COMBS) located at each MOB are government-owned.  The COMBS at Andrews AFB provides supply support to all the C-20s based at Andrews.  In addition to the MOB supply and maintenance support, the new contract will include a requirement for depot maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) and depot field team support worldwide for the C-20 airframe, engine, accessories, and avionics.  The depot support shall include all inspections and maintenance required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the government (DoD and FAA).  The depot maintenance requirement will also include complete airframe paint removal, corrosion control and repaint, as required by the applicable service, as well as security for all C-20 aircraft in depot.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/RFP for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.   This solicitation, M67004-03-R-0036, is a Request for Proposal. The RFP number is assigned for administration purposes only and no solicitation document exists.  The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Balanced Scorecard Collaborative to provide technical assistance. The proposed contract action is for follow-on services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract will have an  eight-month performance period. This requirement is in support of the Marine Corps Logistics Command. The North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) code is 541611(Administrative, Management, and General Management Consulting Services).  This is a total small business set-aside.  The Statement of work is as follows:  Prior to the stand up of Marine Corps Logistics Command (LOGCOM) there were three commands, MATCOM Headquarters and two subordinate commands within the MATCOM—Marine Corps Logistics Bases (LOGBASES) and Marine Corps Systems Command (SYSCOM).  MATCOM Headquarters and Logistics Bases have merged to form the LOGCOM; SYSCOM will no longer be a part of the organization. The current challenge will be to reorganize the mission, visions and objectives of the new command into a balanced scorecard framework.  It is essential that we bring the strategic planning  efforts of the functional areas within the LOGCOM into alignment. Problems will arise if the detailed elements of the strategy contained within the corporate level strategy do not cascade into similar detailed objectives, measures, targets and initiatives resident in the functional units.  Failure to conduct a rigorous alignment creates a high risk of functional units executing local, sub-optimized strategies versus the integrated, common corporate strategy the LOGCOM is seeking.  Further, alignment sessions provide a valuable opportunity to begin communicating both up and down the chain of command specifics regarding execution of the strategy.  Creating the actual balanced scorecard is only the first step toward implementation of the strategy.  A process must be established that takes the information contained in the balanced scorecard framework and brings it to life as part o f an ongoing management system.  Balanced scorecard terminology refers to this as the governance process.   Scope/Object: There are two areas that we consider to be critical for the success of the scorecard effort: Merging Command Scorecards and, Establishment of a Governance Process. Additionally, task 2.3 and 2.4 are identified to support the completion of tasks 2.1 and 2.2. Task:  Merger of Command Scorecards, The contractor shall assist the government with the alignment process required to merge the two previous Commands’ scorecards.  At a minimum, the contractor shall assist with the following actions:  ·   Collection and review of the two commands’ strategic plans, strategy maps and Balanced Scorecards created to date; ·   Facilitation of an alignment matrix—a graphical tool designed to align initiatives to strategic objectives within the core competency organizations;   ·   Facilitation of alignment sessions among planning and core team representatives from each of the functional areas in order to develop the strategy;  ·   Facilitation of alignment sessions among the senior leaders of each functional area to review and finalize the alignment and resolve issues beyond the decision-making capacity of the core teams,  ·   Development of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for implementation of the Balanced Scorecard.   Task:  Establishment of a Governance Process,  The contractor shall assist the government in establishing a governance process.  The governance process shall clearly establish all of the activities required to set up and operate the process of managing LOGCOM’s strategy. At a minimum, the contractor shall assist with the following actions:  ·   Developing the balanced scorecard review meeting schedule integrating core compete ncy organizations; ·   Designing the reporting format in which the data will be presented; ·   Establishing the measures and initiative data collection; ·   Documenting the follow-up and action review procedures; ·   Facilitating management review meetings, as requested.  Task:  Knowledge Transfer, The contractor shall provide concept training, application training, and process flows, experience/exposure that will enable organic personnel to function independently.  Task:  Site Visits, An associate and/or facilitator shall be available for on-site assistance as required during the period of performance.  The government will establish the schedule and duration for on-site visits 15 days prior to the meeting.  The requirement will be no more than 1 week per month from 0800 – 1630.  A senior associate shall be provided for eight days, of on site, executive level facilitation, (8  hours per day).

<DESC>FISC intends to award a short term Firm Fixed Price contract to Aravo Solutions for the procurement of their Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) supplier enablement software system, in order to test the feasibility of transforming the Navy’s contracting workflow.  This software has specific features FISC anticipates will be critical for success.  Number notes 22 applies. This is not a requirement competing for a buy of software for production implementation. The awardee of this requirement is not guaranteed a follow on contract.  If the pilot results prove out the feasibility and advantages of transforming, then a larger requirement will be developed solicited under full and open competitive procedures.

BACKGROUND:   The awardee under this requirement will be required to provide the necessary software, tools, and training to enable Navy buyers to successfully link with several private sector suppliers in order to obtain contractually covered catalog content and manage its load into the DoD E-mall and other relevant stores.  The DoD E-mall is a government operated web-based e-commerce site within which government purchase card holders can buy supplies and/or services, including government stocks, commercial items, IT items, and training services.   The DoD Emall is managed by the e-Business Program Office of Defense Logistics Agency, Ft Belvior, VA.   Technical support for the DoD EMall is provided by Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) in Battle Creek, MI.  The Navy Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) has recently decided to collaborate with the DoD EMall to assist in satisfying its e-commerce goals.  FISC Norfolk, a part of NAVSUP, has been working e-commerce initiatives for several years and has the responsibility of managing the supply base for its customers and establishing e-commerce solutions for customers that will provide better value, while streamlining the procurement process.   This pilot project is spurred by several NAVSUP/FISC strategic goals, including streamlining simple procurements, generating more e-commerce transactions, and managing markets to increase value to customers.

SCOPE:  Sellers: Up to 50 company product catalogs, SKU’s not to exceed 100000, Buyers:  3 Navy FISC’s (Norfolk, Puget Sound, San Diego) plus representatives from NEXCOM and NAVFAC, 2 week installation of supplier enablement software in government computing environment (NAVSISA), 3 month operational up time, 2 month data gathering and metrics development.


REQUIREMENTS
Technical:
Software shall be 100% Java (J2EE), and be deployable both within an enterprise firewall or hosted (ASP); run on industry standard hardware and software backbones, including Sun Solaris, Oracle 8i and BEA WebLogic; employ Java 2 enterprise edition standards and allow for easy plug-and-play with external systems; utilize XML messaging interfaces to comply with standard marketplace platforms, (such as Commerce One (xCBL), Ariba (cXML), Microsoft (BizTalk) and RosettaNet-based systems); and provide Industrial strength data cleansing, workflow and security packages.
Functional:
Software shall provide a staging area for commercial catalogue data wherein government buyers and private sector suppliers can work.  This area must shall permit the government to flag SKUs which are problematic, permit the contractors to address the issues, and allow a finally approved catalogue to be instantly loaded into either the DoD E-Mall or another store. Additionally, the collection of catalogues must be able to be maintained within the system, and the software will be required to screen a catalog’s SKU’s for only those which have changed since original submission (and have yet to be re-reviewed). Software shall use statistical random sampling to permit efficient review of very large catalogues; support multiple enablement paths (ie. sending some catalogues on to the DoD E-Mall, others into an ERP system (like SAP), others onto CDs, and others no where at all – but saved in the system) allow a buyer to search for catalogs and SKUs and find associated vendors (and the contracts they are covered under); and support the geographic scope of the project and anticipated transaction volume.

Note to the contractors:
The contractor shall provide an existing COTS product – which means that no modifications are necessary or no new development is required.  The Contractor shall be able to install their product with minimal configuration changes within a 2 week period.  Afterwards, there shall be 3 months of operations and 2 months or metrics and evaluations, in order to develop deliverables. 

OBJECTIVES:
Establish an on-line web-based supplier management tool that provides multiple levels of project visibility into supplier’s data and contracts.
The following levels of visibility are planned: 
Executive View: full rights and visibility of all buyers.
Management View: full rights and visibility, but limited to view into dashboard for one location (i.e., Norfolk sees Norfolk contracts/catalogues and National contracts/catalogues but not those restricted to Puget Sound). 
User View: view into one buyer site with ability to personalize the view to see only the suppliers and activity queue assigned to that user. 
Demonstrate visibility of supplier catalogs, with active status review screens, within all players (buyers, sellers, side interest organizations)
Demonstrate the ability to view status of complete contracts (supplier profile data and complete/incomplete status of the contract) of both national and regional FISC Norfolk contracts. 
Establish a link between a buyer and at least one supplier (or contract) at each participating site 
Provide a universal view (executive view) of the pilot status in Norfolk. 
Integrate data and communications between the buyers, DLIS, and the suppliers. 
Configuration of software to fit high-level requirements:
Excel Catalog Template including required and optional fields 
Validation rules 
Export file format 
Demonstration of the supplier profiling aspect of the tool.
Provide necessary training to the buyers at each site selected to work on this initiative.

Secondary Objectives:

Actively support status reviews and briefings to high level military and civilian managers at any site.	
Establish questionnaires to segment, profile, and evaluate suppliers as potential suppliers to satisfy government requirements.
Demonstrate the software’s ability maintain important information on individual suppliers that will create a database of information on managed suppliers.
Assist in communications with participating suppliers to describe the pilot initiative, including benefits, schedules, training, samples, registration, etc. 
Customize web tools to reflect Navy/DoD E-mall icons and representation.
Establish savings metrics that compares the current process to the new supplier enabled E-commerce process. Metrics to include hard and soft dollars saved, speed of enablement, a quality improvement rating of the data provided using the tool compared to “as is.”
Supply metrics and data reports as required.
Provision and update of a pilot schedule.

DELIVERABLE:  In addition to the services and support levels outlined above, it is also expected that a detailed final report will be generated by the supplier that fully discusses and assesses the pilot project.  Each objective is to be reviewed and evaluated, and final metrics reports are to be included.  

PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  This pilot project shall run from July 2003 to December 2003, a period of approximately six months.

<DESC>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LN), plans to procure a Gatan Retractable Multi-Scan CCD Camera with Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation, 3 Electronics Avenue, Danvers, MA  01923.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 423450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Laboratory of Neurobiology engages in fundamental research on the structural basis of synaptic transmission, New advances make it possible to apply tomography to understand the structure of the post synaptic apparatus.  The purchase of a specialized digital camera is needed to collect and analyze images generated by a JEOL electron microscope for tomography of the post-synaptic apparatus.  A new technique of tomography applies a mathematical algorithm to analyze multiple (50 or more) images of the same part of the section taken at a series of angles, thereby producing images at the molecular level.  In order to photograph these series a high resolution digital camera needs to be incorporated directly into the electron microscope, and the camera must be connected to a computer that can direct the taking of the images as well as their storage and preliminary analysis.  The digital camera offered by AMT is specifically designed for collecting multiple images in the electron microscope.  AMT offers a camera specifically designed to work with a, (previously purchased by NINDS) JEOL 100 CX and 200 CX interchangeably.  Images collected in the computer running the camera can be directly saved at full resolution and gray scale in TIFF format directly legible in Photoshop running on Apple computers, and the information content of these images will be at least 2600X2600 pixels at 16 bits (>7 MB image).  A 61x62m phosphor detector will give a field of view at least 70% the size of that with 3 1/4" film, and the sensitivity of the camera will be measurably better than standard Kodak EM film.   Images will be magnified no more than 2X onto the surface of the phosphor which collects the image. These camera specifications are all necessary to optimize the collection of EM images over the most commonly used magnification range of the microscope.  Camera can be switched easily from one microscope to another by the operator.  In the past contamination of the camera chip by vacuum oils has been a problem.  AMT has designed a camera that, except for the collecting phosphor, lies completely outside the vacuum system.  The camera will have a fast scan mode needed to focus quickly on the specimen before images are collected.   The camera chip is air cooled so no water connections are necessary.  Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation is the only source known to the NINDS that can provide the aforementioned CCD Camera with the specifications required.
The AMT camera is a general use camera system designed and tested for collecting images in JEOL 100-CX or 200-CX electron microscopes, previously purchase and in currently in use by the NINDS researchers. However, this camera represents striking new advances in the state of the art which make it uniquely suited to the needs of our program.   Delivery and installation must be on or before July 1. 2003.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 13, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/HQ intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Earth Observation Magazine (EOM).  The authority for other than full and open competition is only one responsible source. NASA’s is acquiring from EOM a special edition of the magazine that specifically features geographic, mapping, and Earth information.  EOM’s design concept has developed over the past ten years to effectively promote the technologies by featuring aesthetically pleasing images and pictures derived from satellite, airplane or unmanned vehicle and illustrating that these images are not just attractive but provide myriad benefits. With EOM’s standing and credibility in the publication, Earth Observation Technology (EOT) communities and subscription base is what makes them qualified to feature these articles and images. The requirements include design, layout, production, printing, and distribution (mailing/postage) of twenty-seven thousand copies of a special edition of EOM magazine.  This special edition is similar to a previous issue released in August 2002.  The series of articles to be featured in this newest edition highlights several Earth science models, their predictive capabilities, and their connections to decision support for applications of national priority.	This is intended to bridge the gap between NASA earth science research results and their practical value to society. The subscriber list that EOM maintains contains the names of the people we want to reach. EOM's list is propriety which makes the names unavailable externally.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 3, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

. This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items which implements Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAM) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions.  This solicitation is a standing solicitation, which allows vendors to submit offers at anytime; therefore, there is no closing date for the receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This solicitation will be periodically refreshed to include new and updated provisions and instructions as they relate to the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program. The solicitation can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.  Resultant contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed priced with an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA).

There is a contract sales criterion for all MAS contracts.  Clause I-FSS-639 entitled, Contract Sales Criteria, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25.000.  Resultant contracts will be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from the date of award are not $25,000 or above. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders and you are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the threshold.

The IFF must be included in the offered prices to GSA under this solicitation.  A new term called "Evergreen Contracting" option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  The Evergreen clause provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all MAS Federal Supply Schedules to a one 5-year basic contract period, with three separate 5-year option periods.  The Government Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional five(5) year period, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days prior to the expiration date of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favorite Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as well as any other pertinent information in order for the Government to determine that at the current prices are fair and reasonable.  All vendors and current contractors should be award that the Evergreen Contracting option period extension can not be exercised if your electronic catalog has not been approved and posted on GSA Advantage!

<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938642 lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Hoover Dam has a need to create memorabilia items from excess scrap copper from a transmission line.  This all copper transmission line was originally installed at Hoover Dam in 1936.  The line is 100 percent copper without any outer or inner insulation.  It is currently cut into 20 foot sections.  It weighs 1.5 pounds per foot.  The cable comes in two sizes:  (1) 1 3/8 inch in diameter, 1/8 inch thick and (2) doubled with the 1 inch all copper cable inside the 1 1/8 inch cable.  Approximately 60,000 feet of transmission line is available for this purpose.  Small samples will be available upon request. Hoover Dam seeks ideas to create souvenir items for tourists visiting Hoover Dam.  It is our desire to preserve the original line:  i.e., the line will not be melted or mixed with other metals.  Our goal is to suitably present and package this copper cable so as to create an affordable, portable souvenir item that would provide Hoover Dam visitors with an opportunity to commemorate their visit to Hoover Dam by purchasing a keepsake. Interested vendors should fax their request of interest to Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8050.  Please include a synopsis of your company.  This procurement will be done under Simplified Acquisition Procedures which is set aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 541613 and the size standard is six million.  (A companys average gross receipts cannot exceed six million over a three-year period)

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.   The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage) relative to this _541690_NAICS Code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years.

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations for the five regional Centers for the Application for Prevention Technologies or CAPTs.  The CAPTs are SAMHSA/CSAP’s primary knowledge application and capacity expansion program supporting CSAP’s mission to bring effective substance abuse prevention to every community. As such, the CAPTs form the cornerstone of CSAP’s efforts to move science into services. Under the guidance of CSAP, the CAPTs work to expand the capacity of the substance abuse prevention field through the application of effective evidence/science-based programs, practices, and policies within every State prevention service system and community. To accomplish this, the CAPTs provide their clients with timely and effective technical assistance, training, dissemination, and communication services that increase the transfer and application of substance abuse prevention knowledge and skills.

The overall CAPT program goals are to:

·	Serve as one of SAMHSA/CSAP’s major resource for expanding capacity, increasing effectiveness, and strengthening the performance accountability of substance abuse prevention services at both the State and community levels.
   
·	Disseminate effective evidence/science-based substance abuse prevention programs, practices, and policies so that they can be applied successfully within the diverse contexts of life within U.S. communities, States, Tribes, and other US Jurisdictions.

·	Provide effective technical assistance and training that expand the capacity of States and communities to implement effective substance abuse prevention services.  Such training and technical assistance is coordinated with the ongoing work of SAMHSA’s other dissemination efforts.

The incumbents on the CAPT’s cooperative agreements are the following: 1) Minnesota Institute of Public Health; 2) Education Development Center, Inc.: 3) Developing Resources for Education in America, Inc. (DREAM); 4) Southwest Prevention Center, University of Oklahoma; 5) University of Nevada, Reno; and 6) Arizona-Mexico Border Health Foundation. 

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 1) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 2) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  3) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 4) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 5) Are you a certified Service–Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 

Furthermore, your responses should address your capabilities in the following areas;

1.	Most importantly, the CAPT’s are to provide state of the art substance abuse prevention training and technical assistance to States to build infrastructure and community capacity to adapt and implement effective substance abuse prevention programs.

2.	The CAPTs are expected provide services in accord with the program policies of SAMHSA/CSAP.

3.  The offeror must inform the Project Officers of any publication based on the contract project. Additionally, the offeror must also ensure consistency with relevant CSAP and SAMHSA editorial guidelines and policies (e.g., use of logos, text, format, and related production qualities) before disseminating any CAPT product. It must also comply with Title IV, Sec. 711 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that applies when developing promotional public service announcements.
	
4.	 The CAPTs have collaborated to establish a cross-CAPT evaluation plan assuring comparability of data and reporting. There are five Web-enabled databases: Event, Systemic Outcomes, Technical Assistance (TA), Products, and Success Stories. Each CAPT is expected to help shape and maintain these databases. The databases are accessed via the national CAPTUS website.

5.  Offerors must provide information needed by SAMHSA to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) reporting requirements. GPRA mandates accountability and performance-based management by Federal agencies, focusing on results or outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of Federal activities and on measuring progress toward achieving national goals and objectives.  The offerors must comply with GPRA data collection and reporting requirements. A description of the CAPTs’ evaluation procedures and measures (including those pending as GPRA and performance measures) will be presented in the RFP. The final CAPT GPRA and performance measures for the program have not yet been determined, and SAMHSA will be working with the offerors to finalize them and obtain necessary clearances once the contract awards have been made.
	
6.  The CAPT is expected to provide the following types of reports.
·	Quarterly progress reports
·	Annual progress and fiscal reports
·	Final summary report at the end of the third year cycle.
·	Periodic delivery of electronic copies of contact and service data to the contractor providing data coordination of the cross-CAPT databases.

Additional reports may be required on special projects and activities (e.g., collaborative services delivered with supplemental funding by another Federal agency partnering with SAMHSA in this program). 

7.	The offeror must have existing knowledge and experience working with states to support capacity development activities.

8.  The offeror must have a working knowledge of CSAP and SAMHSA policy and programmatic initiatives.

9.  The offeror must be located within the region they would serve and have been providing technical assistance and training for a minimum of two years in order to show they have established relationships with States and communities.

As part of market research, The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for a device to train KC-135 Boom Operators inflight air refueling.   This RFI is an attempt to locate large as well as any and all types of small business capable of performing this type of development project for an effective standardized Air Force flying training program.  Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does not constitute a current or any future Government requirement.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no costs to the Government.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry’s capabilities for the contemplated services.  To this end, private sector industry is invited to submit capability and cost information demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements below.  Request responses be provided NLT 9 Jul 2003.
Requirement. 
The BOWST should be a fully functional simulator capable of three-dimensional graphics presentation and visual and audio acuity that will allow the transfer of syllabus events from the aircraft to the simulator.
Duties and proficiency levels for all training events are listed in the attached table.   Those events considered transferable from the aircraft to a high fidelity simulator are identified in column 3.
Training Proficiency Enhancements (see attached table)
The BOWST must be able to simulate in-flight refueling for a wide range of receivers and formations of receivers, in wartime and peacetime operational scenarios, in all weather conditions, over land or water.  It must be capable of simulating emergency situations and system degradations (IAW Table) that require specific and timely responses from the student.  These student responses must be accurately reflected in the displays and indications within the simulator.  
The visual system is considered key to a BOWST.  The visual display will provide an accurate presentation of the receiver's position and movement providing the depth perception cues regardless of head position and movement within the crew station. The student will also be able to have an unrestricted view of, and access to, all instruments and controls within the student’s cockpit area. Both the student crew position and the instructor position must be able to determine the receiver’s position relative to the air-refueling boom and be able to view the receiver aircraft in the normal fields of view (i.e. breakaway).  The information provided to the instructor must be of sufficient detail and presentation so he/she can make effective and timely inputs to the student actions and facilitate learning.  The console operator/simulator instructor display may be a two-dimensional display but also must provide sufficient detail and information about receiver aircraft’s relative position and the students actions.  The visual display area must be no less than that of the actual aircraft.  If Possible, the visual display will provide an accurate three-dimensional presentation of the receiver's position and movement for both the crew position and the instructor position (two eye-point presentations) regardless of student and instructor head position and movement within the trainer on all windows.
Period of Performance.  TBA
Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small or small disadvantaged business set aside based on responses to this notice.  For purposes of this acquisition, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611512, Flight Training, will be used for this acquisition.  The business size standard is $21.5M.

<DESC>The Atmospheric Early Warning System (AEWS) program office at Hill, AFB UT is currently investigating the option to replace the AN/FPS-124 Short Range Radar which provides low-altitude tracking and surveillance coverage for the North Warning System (NWS) in Canada and Alaska.  The FPS-124 is considered a "Gap-filler" for the FPS-117 Long Range Radar and operates in an unattended, remotely controlled environment.  Due to aging and obsolescence issues, market research is underway to determine if there is a suitable replacement for the FPS-124.  At this point, it shall be noted that no funding is currently available to fund a replacement.  We are only interested in knowing what options are available to us.  Multiple considerations must be made in order to comply with current NORAD requirements as well as have an understanding of the Arctic's harsh environment in which these radars operate.  Attached is a specification sheet for the FPS-124 Radar.  These are the basic requirements, however, staging, installation and set-up cost will also be a factor.  All those interested in replying to this request please contact the FPS-124 System Engineer at Hill AFB.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is actively surveying the vendor community to see if a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a General Service Administration (GSA) schedule commercial pricing arrangement is a viable contract for the Systems Engineering Department (4.1) of NAVAIR. Currently, the Systems Engineering Department exists to provide, train and equip highly skilled systems engineers and engineering staff to naval aviation product teams under Program Executive Officer programs.  The agreement will cover a period of five years.  The total estimated dollar value for the BPA will be $5,000,000.00, which is approximately $1,000,000.00 for each year of the BPA.

The anticipated effort under the BPA includes but is not limited to the following draft Statement of Work (SOW):

NAVAIR 4.1 Requirements Management System 
Statement of Work

1.0 Introduction

1.1 NAVAIR 4.1 exists to provide, train and equip highly skilled systems engineers and engineering staff to naval aviation product teams under Program Executive Officer programs.  To improve the accuracy and efficiency of established NAVAIR systems engineering processes, NAVAIR 4.1 intends to establish and use a computer-based information management system that will assist in the development, linkage and validation of system requirements and provide traceable flow down to system, design and product specifications, and test plans.

1.2 NAVAIR 4.1 has examined several alternative methods to accomplish this, and has selected an off-the-shelf software product, Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), by Telelogic.  This approach is intended to incorporate and compliment established NAVAIR processes and specific formats, as well as hardware and software provided by NAVAIR 4.1's IT laboratory.  This laboratory space, facilities and computing architectures, “the Lab”, will be time-shared by multiple participating client engineering staffs. 

1.3 We expect the Lab to directly assist production, review, validation, publication and maintenance of program supportive technical documentation and other related materials that may be identified as client programs mature.  This may require functionality beyond capability of the DOORS software product and therefore potential exists for expansion of the Lab tool suite to include additional commercially available engineering, system engineering software tools. 
  
1.4 Data and related information within the Lab may be classified or unclassified, may be proprietary to one or more contractors, and must be appropriately protected.  The Lab must maintain a detailed, permanent historical record of changes to project documents and associated supporting rationale.  The Lab must maintain traceable linkages among data elements across all related documents.  The linkages must enable a capability to identify and display specific elements of all program documents that are potentially impacted by any change to any other related document.


2.0 Background

2.1 Systems engineers and other collaborators will develop capabilities, analysis and system specification information that must be readily accessible to current and future project personnel. Further, the scope and detail of the information available for the project dictates the need for computer-based tools to establish and maintain relationships among the several generations of higher-level guidance, system capability document and supporting analyses.

2.2 The information to be managed may be any or all of the following: unclassified, classified, proprietary, competition sensitive. The Lab must maintain attributes for specific data elements to allow generation of documents and reports that clearly identify the proprietary or competition sensitivity of any information they contain. All personnel associated with this work, including contractors, will be required to execute non-disclosure and information protection agreements as well as appropriate security clearances.

2.3 The information management system software will be installed on NAVAIR provided computing resources, with security and access controls as specified by NAVAIR operating instructions.  Equipment, software and connectivity, after initial configuration and start-up operation, will be provided by NAVAIR, however the system may be moved to Navy Marine Corps Internet (NMCI) hardware and software in the future. The contractor must verify that the planned NAVAIR computer systems and software meet the needs of this program as defined below.

3.0 Scope

3.1 This Statement of Work supports NAVAIR 4.1 in evolving collaborative functional processes and management tools to gather and review ideas, generate requirements for detailed study or analysis and report results within the client project teams, and to exchange this information with selected customers. It establishes the operation of a computer-based information management system to facilitate requirements documentation development, system specification coordination, design development tasks and test planning. The project should improve functional processes by incorporating new information technologies and training client program staffs in their use. It should reduce requirements review and development cycle times and allow for measurement of the system’s effectiveness and efficiency in managing selected documentation and technical relationships. It should provide a capability to link detailed, specific system requirements to system capabilities, facilitate analysis of future mission task expansion and identify deficiencies in existing baselines.  It must provide program systems engineers and supporting contractors the capability to develop, document, coordinate, analyze, generate and maintain long-term history and change traceability of systems requirement and specification information at a detailed level of reference.  Gap analysis among the multiple levels of system specifications is an important part of the expected functionality.



4.0 Specific Requirements

4.1 Configure a computer-based Requirements Management System (“the system”) on NAVAIR provided hardware and software to reside within NAVAIR workspaces designated by NAVAIR 4.1.  Provide an information management system with the capability to develop, review, coordinate and link related information concerning system capabilities within established information domains. Provide requested analyses of linked data to client program personnel, their contractors and customers. 

4.1.1 Expand and refine the information and documentation domain of the system as required to support evolution of technical baselines and test plans.

4.1.2 Populate the system with any existing, provided reference data to establish a detailed set of reference and historical data for client program use.

4.1.3 Enhance and tailor system capabilities to the specific functions and processes identified by client programs to improve the functional processes for producing and reviewing documents.

4.1.4 Develop procedures for methodical review of program documents that allows focused examination and linkage to other plans and programs.

4.1.5 Coordinate with client System Engineers for system utilization scheduling, project meeting support and travel requirement.

4.1.6 Coordinate with NAVAIR 4.1 any system hardware and/or software upgrades required or recommended for any work under this SOW or extensions thereto.

4.2 Identify to client System Engineers and to NAVAIR 4.1 any technical issues or problems associated with installation or operation of the system.  Document such issues and identify potential solutions in the monthly report.

4.2.1 Provide controlled, selective capability to distribute for review, validate and attribute to source, all inputs received; consolidate suggested changes and incorporate all changes adjudicated by designated proper authority by update of all effected documentation contained within the system.

4.2.2 Provide the capability to produce working and final copies of selected information and documents (e.g. Operational Requirements Document, System Specification) from the system database in accordance with client program prescribed formats.

4.2.3 Recommend introduction and incorporation strategies of additional commercially available engineering - system engineering software tools into the Lab when client requirements cannot be met by current Lab configuration or functionality.  

4.3 Provide the capability to exchange selected data between the Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), and Microsoft Office software to allow client program and other designated personnel to develop and review requirements at their normal office workstations using Microsoft Office desktop applications.


4.4 Provide a user's manual for the purpose of training designated client program personnel. Train such personnel on new processes and system operating procedures, in accordance with the user's manual, to include development, coordination and production of documents, linking and tracing of information within the system and use of templates and other parts of the reference database. Include typical procedures for data analysis and validation in the manual.

4.5 Coordinate with client project system engineers, program stakeholders and customers as required to facilitate data collection, development, analysis and reporting. A primary goal of these visits will be to coordinate efficient and effective automated/electronic information exchange with the system.

4.6 Execute information protection, clearance and non-disclosure agreements with client project teams, NAVAIR and other military agencies as required.

5.0 Coordination, Reporting, and Administration

Description
Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Force Combat Command, anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska on or about 9 June 2003.  Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Offutt AFB project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Offutt project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.  The Offutt Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,255 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,255 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,568 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Successful Offeror (SO).  The Government may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Offutt family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<SUBJECT>60 -- bc/bs Part A & Part B Palmetto GBA SC
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under Simple Acquisition Procedures, a purchase order to Carmichael, Bradsher, Tuvell & Savage, 1647 Mt. Vernon Road, Atlanta, GA 30388. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Contracting Officer is reviewing the Novation request from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (Palmetto GBA). The Contracting Officer asked the Division of Finance Oversight (DFO) if all Administrative Cost issues have been resolved with Palmetto GBA.  A Risk Assessment Review had been started by the Atlantic Regional Office (RO) for the period FY 1993-1997, but was not completed and the Risk Assessment Report was not written. The Atlanta Regional Office (RO) does not have sufficient documentation from the Risk Assessment Report to close Administrative costs from the period for the Part A and Part B contracts.

The DFO and the Atlantic RO decided that an audit firm familiar with Palmetto GBA’s accounting system would be able to perform an Administrative Cost audit with an accelerated period of performance. Carmichael, Brasher, Tuvell & Company has just completed field work and issued the FY 1998-2001 final audit of the Administrative costs of Palmetto GBA for Part A and to the DFO for approval. The DFO requests that the contract for the FY 1993-1997 audit of the Administrative cost of Palmetto GBA for Part A and Part B be awarded to Carmichael, Brasher, Tuvell & Company. Their experience in the recent FY 1998-2001 Administrative cost audit of Palmetto GBA for Part A & B will enable them to complete the audit an accelerated period of performance.

<SUBJECT>A -- COLLABORATIVE CLINICAL RESEARCH
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH,  1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV intends to award, on a sole source basis, a  purchase order to the West Virginia University, Department of Pediatrics.  West Virginia University and its associated WVU Research Corporation are nonprofit educational and research organizations and by performing the activities specified under this contract, NIOSH would be establishing essential new research capabilities, validated noninvasive tests for monitoring inflammatory status and immune function in human subjects.  The primary reason why this contract should be noncompetitively negotiated with West Virginia University Research Corporation is its geographic proximity to NIOSH-Morgantown.  Its close proximity to NIOSH will allow NIOSH investigators to be directly involved in the recruitment of study subjects and collection of research samples.  In addition, it will make it possible for these samples to be immediately transported to NIOSH laboratories for evaluation.  This is extremely important as delays in sample processing imposed by shipping of samples can in many cases affect research results.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Organizations that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the posting date of this notice.  Interested parties shall provide documentation which demonstrates that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:   Brenda L. Goodwin., Reference: #HELD03S0021, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will solely be used  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to WVU Research Corporation.  All information received will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Phase II of BAA SP0410-97-S-0005/SP0410-01-D-0004
<DESC>This serves as notification of the Government's intent to exercise an option under Phase II of contract SP0410-01-D-0004 with The Boeing Company. This option aims to demonstrate the SURGE (Supplier Utilization through Responsive Grouped Enterprises) concept for the aircraft machine parts grouping that was submitted under Phase I of the same contract. This option will serve to further test Phase II of the SURGE theory by testing a second set of parts that were grouped by their manufacturing similarities. The machine parts grouping is the second of three Phase II groupings to be tested. The Government reserves the right to exercise an option period to extend the machine parts grouping for one year following the initial one year purchasing period. It is anticipated that the option will be exercised by July 2003.

Take note of the following stipulation:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)
(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;
