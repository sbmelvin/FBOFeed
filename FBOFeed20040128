<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase an Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM) from Quality Monitoring & Control, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) Quality Monitoring & Control is the developer of the QMC Program Suite and associated sensor and hardware codes for fault diagnostics.	These specific codes are required to support the Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM) efforts and cannot be obtained from other computer codes.  (b) Quality Monitoring & Control has substantial experience in creating the specific diagnostics software and technologies to adapt our existing codes to work in the SSME Engineering Environment.  The government program office will maximize investment dollars by taking advantage of Quality Monitoring & Control existing development and expertise.  (c) Quality Monitoring & Control software is currently under license at NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for use in physics and numeric modeling as well as in sensor and equipment fault detection with diagnostics.  (d) Quality Monitoring & Control has the ability to perform real-time dynamic simulations and incorporates a newly developed property package that includes Rocket Propellant-1 (RP-1), which will be used to support analysis of new rocket engines.  (e) Quality Monitoring & Control is currently performing Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM) work at MSFC under a purchase order.  It is anticipated that a modification will be awarded within the next 30 days. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on February 12, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

As stated in clause 52-212-1 the Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

Contractors are reminded that the VA now uses the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov as their primary source of vendor information and payment purposes.  All Contractors are required to register.   The statement of work is:   (1)	The selected appraiser shall prepare and deliver a complete, self-contained appraisal report for the subject property in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP, latest ed.), and conform to the “Uniform Appraisals Standards For Federal Land Acquisitions -- Land Acquisition Conference of 1992.”  Appraisal methods should involve application of standard approaches to value; namely the cost, income, and market approaches.  The application of the approaches to value is dependent upon the appraisal problem involved and the appraiser’s professional judgment; however, deviation from normal practices, methods and techniques are to be noted and fully supported by comment and justification.  It should be understood that the appraisal report will be subject to careful review; therefore the report must be fully detailed with all items substantiated and justified by appropriate information and data, so that reviewers will find validity in the appraiser’s conclusions.  The report should address severance damages (diminution in value), if any, to the remaining federal property.  Any deficiencies, which in the reviewer’s opinion require further substantiation, and or work, must be performed as a supplement to the reviewer’s satisfaction, at the appraiser’s expense.  The appraisal report is an important document that serves as a material aid in negotiations, and a basis for commitments that bind the Department of Veterans Affairs.  It is therefore essential that the appraisal’s content reveal that the appraiser has made an adequate study and analyses of the appraisal problem and has considered all available, pertinent and reliable data and that sound and logical reasoning is used in developing value conclusions. Appraisals will be performed in narrative form and will include, all essential data to disclose the purpose of the appraisal, the scope of the appraisal problem, and the principle methods and reasoning process employed, and all available pertinent supporting data to sustain the appraiser’s final conclusion as to value.  Items such as photographs, sketches, charts, and exhibits, etc. are considered integral parts of each report.  The use of standardized appraisal report forms does not adapt itself to VA requirements.  The appraiser shall be required to schedule progress review(s) with VA prior to submittal(s).     (2)	  The inspection of the subject properties, all analysis, and the formation of all conclusions, are to be made only by the appraiser named herein.     (3)	The real property to be appraised will be on the basis of highest and best use as improved. “Market Value” (FMV) is defined as the most probable price that a property would bring in a competitive and open market, with the buyer and seller acting knowledgeably and prudently in their own best interests, without undue stimulus.  The price must also represent the normal consideration for the property, unaffected by creative financing or sale concessions.    (4)     Interest to be valued: Current FMV of fee simple title.       (5)      Deliverables and Schedule:  The appraiser shall be required to schedule progress review(s) with VA prior to all submittals.  The appraiser shall provide five (5) copies of the draft appraisal report for VA review not later than two (2) business weeks after engagement.  Upon VA approval, the appraiser shall finalize the report and provide one original camera copy and four (4) reproduction copies of the appraisal report no later than two (2) business weeks after VA approves the draft report.   OFFERS ARE DUE BY 11:00 AM, ON FEBRUARY 12, 2004.  NO FAXED OFFERS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE ADDRESSED IN WRITING TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  NO PHONE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WILL BE HONORED.

<DESC>Gaining and maintaining the initiative has become the basis by which Marine Corps forces have successfully waged battles in the past.  This emphasis on gaining and maintaining the initiative, so successful to date, has the potential to become imperiled when one applies recent historical trends to battlefields of the future.  Specifically, the Marine Corps and the underlying concept of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) place an extremely high demand on the ability to rapidly move large forces over great distances with minimal delay.  This tends to stretch the capability of combat service support units and engineer support battalions to the limit of their current capabilities.

More specifically, the current bridging capabilities and assets resident within the Marine Corps have diminished utility on the modern battlefield.  Bridging assets are neither capable of being rapidly emplaced nor sufficient in structure to handle the stresses of modern wheeled and tracked combat vehicles.

Current bridging assets within the Marine Corps can be grouped into three (3) distinct categories: assault bridging, tactical bridging, and line of communication (LOC) bridging.  The bridging assets in these categories are the result of past development and procurement programs in the U.S. Army.  Assault bridging in the Marine Corps consists of the Armored  Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) and can be best described as a vehicular mounted, scissor type bridge that is used to cross gaps up to 15 meters at Military Load Classification (MLC) 70 (an upgraded version can support MLC 70 up to 18 meters).  It is primarily used for in-stride, short-term breaching purposes for the M1A1 main battle tank.  On the other hand, tactical bridging used by the Marine Corps is a panel type bridge structure designed to be conventionally emplaced from near to far shore, primarily utilizing human assets.  As a result, there is no commonality between either system regarding interchangeability of parts, concepts of employment and emplacement and/or displacement.  To further exacerbate the problem, the Marine tactical bridging asset known as the Medium Girder Bridge (MGB), reaches the end of its service life in 2008.  Recent lessons learned have shown the MGB is susceptible to damage if left in place and unmonitored for long periods.

The data contains Export Controlled Information and as a result, the data itself will not be posted.  Instructions on how to access the data will be posted with the solicitation.    
Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
 This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC 5317.7590 (Insurance Policy) and AFMC FAR Sup 5353.317-9018 (Mission Essential Quantity); portions of the requirement may be restricted for award to a proven source.

Pending acceptance of the First Article(s), the balance will then be awarded to the best value offeror.

As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>TITLE: Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) Interim Signal Data Processor (SDP) and MMR Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) SDP Redesign for the MH-60R Aircraft

17.	The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue delivery orders under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-03-G-0014 with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration (LMSI), 1801 State Route 17C, Owego, NY, 13827-3998, on an other than full and open competitive basis for the development of an Interim SDP and the redesign of the SDP for use in future production lots.  Both efforts are necessitated by the obsolescence of parts for the current MMR SDP.  The proposed delivery orders will include engineering, integrated logistics support and analysis; software support; technical, administrative, and financial data; and delivery of a COTS SDP Engineering Change Proposal for integration of the system into MH-60R production.  As the sole manufacturer and developer of the MH-60R weapon system, including the system’s AN/APS-147 Radar, Common Cockpit and mission avionics, LMSI is the only contractor with the experience and technical data necessary to produce and integrate MH-60R LRIP II weapon systems.  LMSI’s experience with SH-60B Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) MK III development of Common Cockpit and mission avionics, MH-60R LRIP I and LRIP II mission avionics, and MH-60R Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phases I and II, provides the company with the necessary knowledge and experience to produce and integrate the complex MH-60R MMR Interim SDP and COTS SDP design properly.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO APPLIED RESEARCH ASSOCIATES (ARA), INC. 4300 SAN MATEO BLVD. NE, ALBUQUERQUE, NM.  The Agile Combat Support Systems Program Office, AAC/YBCK, Eglin AFB FL, intends to issue a sole source award as an additional option for increased quantities, as well as an in-scope modification for pre-planned product improvement (P3I) efforts.  The schedule is the driving factor for contemplating sole source, due to notional urgent requirements.  The offeror must provide the following:  (1) Produce 10 additional All-purpose Remote Transport System (ARTS) platforms and attachments, which includes 90MM Dragon Mount Assembly, Surface Clearance Assembly, and Robotic Backhoe Assembly, by 30 Sep 04; (2) Upgrade 16 ARTS to current configuration by 31 Dec 04; (3) Produce up to 45 Improved Operator Control Stations by 31 Dec 04; and (4) Produce up to 20 Alternate Control Systems by 30 Sep 04.  A proposed unilateral modification to the current contract, contract number F08635-02-C-0100, is contemplated for the options (items 1 and 2 above), and a bilateral modification for the in-scope changes (item 3 and 4 above).  The production of the items listed above requires a substantial initial investment for manufacture.  As with the current contract the modification will contain provisions placing total system performance and support responsibilities (TSPSR) on the contractor to insure that the contractor is fully responsible for the integration of all systems, subsystems, and components whether Government-furnished property (GFP) or commercially acquired, and for any and all required inspection and acceptance test procedures necessary to meet the system performance specification.  The contractor shall also be responsible for insuring that the integration of the aforementioned will not degrade performance of that item or the ARTS.  Two essential elements of TSPSR are the transfer of configuration control for the ARTS design and performance from the Government to the contractor.  The basic requirements of the proposed contract are as follows.  Check hyperlinks for additional information.  (A) Pre-baselined Product Upgrade - The 16 pre-baseline systems have varying configurations and attachments are a result of three separate buys.  The contractor must independently determine the configuration differences among these systems as no Government data relative to their component makeup is available.  The only such data is proprietary to ARA.  Each configuration (including the current contracted buy) uses the All-Seasons Vehicle, Inc. Posi-Track crawler, Model MD-70, as the platform upon which the robotized system is based.  The current ARTS configuration differs significantly from the original 18 through incorporation of updated software, electronics and hardware, making it more versatile, reliable and supportable than its predecessors.  These pre-baselined units are to be retrofitted to the configuration that exists in the current product drawings and associated lists with no GFP.  Due to operational mission demands, the pre-baselined ARTS must be retrofitted no later than 31 Dec 04.  (B) Additional FY04 ARTS Platforms and Attachments - The additional FY04 production ARTS platforms and attachments are to be produced based on the current Government provided system performance specification with the Government no longer furnishing the Posi-Track crawler, Model MD-70, as GFP.  This NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Any inquiries should be faxed to (850) 882-9381, ATTN:  TSgt Pat Hicks or e-mail patricia.hicks@eglin.af.mil.  Please include POC, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address on any inquires.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W909MY-04-R-0006
<RESPDATE>031504
<ARCHDATE>05142004
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications and Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Team, plans to negotiate a sole source contract with CyTerra Corporation of Waltham, MA for two tasks to improve performance of the AN/PSS-14 for use by humanita rian deminers.  The first task will be the design, fabrication and integration of a thin profile (planar circuit) antenna balun and a position accelerometer onto the AN/PSS-14 platform.  The second task will be the design; fabrication and integration of a Continuous Wave (CW) metal detector (MD) into the AN/PSS-14 platform in an effort to further improve the clutter discrimination capability.  Both tasks must be accomplished with minimal modification to the AS/PSS-14. The first task will encompass an improv ement of antenna-to-system impedance match which in turn help improve the AN/PSS-14 Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) performance and also provide a ground imaging capability in both cross range and down range. The net result of this effort will be an improve d dynamic range, providing additional target imaging information detail to help further discriminate between mines and clutters. The overall system improvement includes an increase in probability of detection and a reduction in false alarm rates. Consequen tly, the improved AN/PSS-14 will significantly provide confidence to and ease the daily tasks undertaken by worldwide humanitarian deminers.  Under this task, CyTerra will perform the following subtasks: 1) Design, fabricate and test an integrated planar c ircuit balun/antenna and a wand tracking accelerometer; 2) Design hardware and software integration; 3) Test the newly integrated AN/PSS-14 assembly.  It has been determined that CyTerra is the 'Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services  will satisfy Agency Requirements'.  The second task will involve integrating of a CW metal detector into the AN/PSS-14 platform to improve clutter discrimination capability.  The CW metal detector (also known as Frequency Domain metal detector) has inhere nt data features in In-phase and Quadrature-phase (I & Q) channels that can be easily characterized. As a result, the data fusion between those of metal detector and those of the AN/PSS-14 Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can be handled seamlessly. This inte gration effort may significantly improve the probability of detection and reduce false alarm rates and consequently will significantly provide confidence to and ease the daily tasks undertaken by worldwide humanitarian deminers. Under this second task, CyT erra along with their subcontractor Geophex, Ltd. will perform the following subtasks: 1) Perform a preliminary design, build and test the CW MD as it is integrated with the AN/PSS-14; 2) Design and develop hardware and software integration concepts; 3) Pe rform final integration and test the integrated system.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all r esponsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required AN/PSS-14 improvements may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than ten (10) pages.  The resulta nt contract will be cost plus fixed fee.  Responses are to be received via email within 45 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to Ms. Jane Borden, Contract Specialist, at the following e-mail address: jane.borden@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See note 22.

<DESC>Responses to Questions:

The following answers are provided in response to questions we have received.

1.	 THERE APPEAR TO BE 19 IDENTIFIED RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS (THE DRUID BIOMASS-ENERGY PROJECT IS LISTED TWICE) IDENTIFIED IN SECTION 6 OF THE SOLICITATION OF WHICH USTDA HAS FUNDED FEASIBILITY STUDIES ON AT LEAST EIGHT.  YOU INDICATE THAT THE CONTRACTOR IS TO VISIT MOST OF THESE PROJECTS WITH A MR. GREENIP.  WHO IS MR. GREENIP AND WHAT KNOWLEDGE DOES HE HAVE OF THESE PROJECTS, ETC?  PLEASE DEFINE "MOST" IN THIS CONTEXT. 
ANSWER:  Scott Greenip is a USTDA employee and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative on this project. Under the Regional Director’s leadership, Scott will supervise the contractor and work with him in evaluating the contractor's recommendations. He is the Country Manager responsible for all the countries  which will be visited on this mission. All his expenses will be covered by USTDA directly and need not be provided for in the contractor's budget. We have not yet determined which projects should be visited.  We would like to visit as many as possible within the level of effort permitted by the budget. The site selection decision will depend on the availability of local counterparts, the status of the on-going USTDA-funded feasibility study at the time of the trip, the level of information we have on a given project at the time of the trip (e.g. if we already know the status well, a visit may not be necessary), geographic proximity as well as other logistical and budgetary considerations. 

2.	WHAT EXISTING REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED FEASIBILITY STUDY FUNDING?  WERE DMS PERFORMED FOR THOSE PROJECTS?  IF YES, ARE THERE DM REPORTS AVAILABLE? 
ANSWER:  All of the projects which USTDA is supporting were recommended by expert consultants.  Most were recommended by the consultant who prepared the briefing book for USTDA's Waste-to-Energy/Renewables conference in November 2001. The briefing book for that conference would be the appropriate reference document. A copy is available for review in USTDA's library. A few were reviewed by Desk Studies, but those reports are not publicly available. 

3.	YOU APPEAR TO HAVE USED THE STANDARD USTDA DM REPORT STRUCTURE AS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR MUST PERFORM.  THIS STRUCTURE APPEARS TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR NEW PROJECTS THAT HAVE NOT ALREADY RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE USTDA FOR FEASIBILITY STUDIES, ETC., BUT THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A SUITABLE REPORT STRUCTURE TO USE TO REPORT ON THE STATUS OF PROJECTS WHERE FEASIBILITY STUDIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED.  PLEASE EXPAND ON THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE PROJECTS WHERE FEASIBILITY STUDIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. 
 ANSWER: A report on a project for which USTDA has already invested in a feasibility study would have two components. First, if the contractor were to recommend USTDA provide additional assistance to the project, the contractor's report would conform to the standard DM format. Some of the background, if still relevant, could be taken from the documentation in the conference briefing book. Second, whether or not additional assistance is recommended, the contractor would be required to provide a few paragraphs (more if necessary, less if possible) describing, at least, the general status of the project, expected future developments, contact information for key players and recommendations for future USTDA consideration. 

4.	 THROUGHOUT SECTION 3.0 "DEFINITIONAL MISSION FINAL REPORT" OF THE SOLICITATION YOU INDICATE "PROJECT" AND NOT "PROJECTS" ALTHOUGH IN SECTION 6 YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 19 SEPARATE PROJECTS.  DO YOU EXPECT A SEPARATE DETAILED ANALYSIS AND REPORT IN THE STANDARD DM REPORT FORMAT FOR EACH PROJECT REVIEWED?  FOR ALL 19 PROJECTS? 
ANSWER: A report in the standard DM format is required only for those projects for which the contractor recommends additional USTDA funding. All other information should be reported in enough detail to cover the subject, but without non-substantive commentary or data that would make the report uninteresting. See answer 3. A concise, complete and understandable report delivered in a timely manner will be an important indicator of a successful mission. 

5.  THE SOW REFERS TO A MR. GREENIP TRAVELING WITH THE DM CONSULTANT.  DO YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON HIM? DOES HE PAY HIS OWN EXPENSES? WHAT IS HIS ROLE?
ANSWER: Scott Greenip is a USTDA employee and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative on this project. Under the Regional Director’s leadership, Scott will supervise the contractor and work with the Regional Director in evaluating the contractor's recommendations. He is the Country Manager responsible for all the countries which will be visited on this mission. All his expenses will be covered by USTDA directly and need not be provided for in the contractor's budget.

<DESC>REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR GHANA AND CAMEROON”

PROJECT TITLE:  GHANA AND CAMEROON: ENERGY SECTOR DEFINITIONAL MISSION

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3			assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4	provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues. 

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		         assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.
  
3		DEFINITIONAL MISSION FINAL REPORT

3.1		EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1-2 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit an executive summary of the report’s findings and recommendations.

3.2		PROJECT DESCRIPTION (3-5 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit a description and history of the project, including, among other things, host country and/or other project sponsors, sector, project location, source of raw materials, infrastructure requirements, proposed technological approach, legal and regulatory framework (licenses, permits, etc.), implementation schedule, economic fundamentals (estimated capital cost, operating costs, expected revenues, etc), and any other key variables or issues that the Contractor deems critical as part of a thorough activity/project evaluation.

3.3	 	DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT (2-3 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit an assessment of the development impact of the project on the host country.  In this section, the Contractor shall discuss two aspects of “developmental impact”.  

3.3.1		Primary Developmental Benefits - The Contractor will discuss the most important benefits that the project will provide to the host country.  Items of interest to USTDA include, but are not restricted, to the following:  number of new jobs created by the project; technology transfers; and new service etc.

3.3.2		Alternatives – Are there competing ways to achieve host country objectives?  At the Definitional Mission stage, it will not be possible to address these questions definitively, but the Contractor, at a minimum, is expected to define and comment on the broad alternatives available to the host country project sponsor.

3.4		PROJECT SPONSOR’S COMMITMENT (1-2 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit a description of the host country project sponsor(s) business/government operations or authority and an assessment of the project sponsor’s ability to implement the project.

3.5		IMPLEMENTATION FINANCING (2-4 PAGES)

The Contractor shall submit a review of the financing options for project implementation, including an assessment of the overall cost estimate of the project and, for projects involving potential U.S. equity investment, the project’s proposed debt-equity structure to ensure that it corresponds to the requirements of the prospective lenders (this aspect is critical to USTDA’s decision making).  As part of this review, the Contractor is required to contact officials from the potential financing institutions, including, where appropriate, multilateral lending institutions, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and private/commercial sources, to assure that the project sponsors have adequately explored their financing options.  The Contractor shall provide names and phone numbers of contacts at the potential lending institutions and summarize their comments.  The Contractor must determine the most likely source(s) of implementation financing and ensure that the terms of reference for any proposed feasibility study fulfill the requirements of the most likely source(s).  

3.6		U.S. EXPORT POTENTIAL (1-2 PAGES)

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA intends to contract with a definitional mission consultant to visit Ghana and Cameroon to identify and evaluate energy sector projects for potential USTDA support.  These two countries have witnessed dramatic development in their energy sectors over the past decade and are beginning to approach USTDA for assistance in developing new projects.  Infrastructure development in this sector assists in generating greater prosperity in the region and consequently creates a more stable political environment.  

Ghana represents a good opportunity for power sector development as there has been a major management turnover within the Ministry of Energy and the Volta River Authority (VRA), the principal energy sector organization in the country, which provides an excellent opportunity for USTDA to provide needed assistance in the formative stage of the strategic planning for both agencies.  Both the Ministry and the VRA have requested assistance from USTDA in the form of a Definitional Mission.

Because Ghana is so dependent on hydroelectric power, the persistent drought conditions in Ghana have created a situation that has forced the Government of consider new power generation facilities that are not dependent upon rainfall.  Moreover, the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) is proceeding at an increased pace now that the legal contractual framework has been accepted to by all of the partner countries.  As a result, this DM could position USTDA to support early project development on a gas-fired power plant as well as power distribution to northern Ghana where sporadic power is the norm.  Both projects would have positive developmental impact on the country of Ghana while at the same time positioning U.S. firms to supply the infrastructure necessary to implement such projects.  The U.S. Embassy in Accra is fully supportive of this Definitional Mission.

Cameroon is in a similar situation whereby it is largely dependent on hydropower facilities.  The AES Corporation bid on and won the privatization of the power sector in Cameroon in 2000-2001.  AES Sonel currently supplies electricity to over 425,000 customers from both thermal and hydroelectric generation plants with installed capacity of 844 MW and two independent transmission networks.  However, because of the lack of rainfall in Camerooon, AES Sonel has been forced to run rolling brown-outs on a regular basis for the past three years.  

AES Sonel has identified projects for the expansion of the transmission and generation facilities including: Bekoko-Nkongsamab transmission line upgrade; IPP access-transmission extension/upgrade; 80 MW heavy fuel oil-fired generating station at Limbe; Oyomabang heavy fuel oil conversion and extension project natural gas-fired power plant; Edea units 1-3 upgrades; new large or medium hydroelectric facility; Sanaga water storage construction; and a hydroelectric project in eastern Cameroon.  The International Finance Corporation is currently reviewing the 80 MW heavy fuel oil fired power station at Limbe that will act as a peaking plant.  AES Sonel has requested that USTDA assist in the project definition and support those projects that are best suited for USTDA’s program.  The U.S. Embassy in Yaounde is similarly supportive of such a Definitional Mission for Cameroon.

<SUBJECT>V -- Title: U.S. AMLR Scientific Vessel Charter, Antarctic Region - Request for Industry Comment
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is seeking information to aid in the chartering of a research vessel to support the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program.  The AMLR program provides information necessary to formulate U.S. policy on the conservation and international management of resources living in the oceans surrounding Antarctica.  The vessel will operate out of Punta Arenas, Chile, and conduct research in the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands, and South Georgia Island.  The ship will be required to transit the Drake Passage and may be required to work in the Bellinghausen and Weddell Seas.  A multi-year (maximum of 5 years) seasonal charter is being considered, commencing January 1, 2005.  During each year, the contract will consist of 70 calendar days (63 underway and 7 days in port) for the execution of a cruise in the Antarctic study area during the January to early March period.  The vessel will be required to conduct a brief shake-down cruise, between legs, and after last leg) to resupply and exchange personnel; for a total of 70 days.  Each year will also have an option for a third research leg with a maximum of 30 days underway and 3 days in port for a total of 103 calendar days (i.e. 93 days underway and 10 days in port).  

The scientific research includes, but is not limited to the following:  bioacoustic surveys, physical oceanography studies, phytoplankton studies, zooplankton surveys, bottom trawl surveys, and seabird and marine mammal observations.  Small boat operations for logistical support of field camps will be conducted from the vessel.  

A suitable vessel shall have a clear open deck space of 93m2 (1000 ft.2) for storage of scientific gear, four (4) side sampling stations for over-the-side sampling and towing, an on deck catch processing area of at least 18.6 m2 (200 ft.2), and an area to be used as a marine mammal and bird observation platform.  The vessel shall have a ice-strengthen hull, have a minimum sustained cruising speed of 12 kts (22.3 km/hr), have the capability to maintain steerage at speeds of 2.0 knots (3.7 km/hour) in calm water for accomplishing scientific tows with drags up to 2,000 lbs. (8.9 kn), have an operational endurance of a minimum of 30 days and an operational range 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 km), have deck equipment to support the deployment and recovery of scientific equipment, small boats (zodiacs) an scientific laboratories.  Deck space for two (2) Government furnished vans 6.1 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m (20 ft x 8 ft x 8ft) shall be available.  If sufficient laboratory space is not available, then a third Government furnished van, with the same dimensions, shall augment the required space.  The vessel shall provide meals and berthing for 22-30 scientific personnel.  Access to electronic outputs from the ship’s Global Positioning System, gyrocompass, positioning equipment and echosounders is required.  Environmental monitoring instrumentation (e.g. Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, thermosalinograph, carousel water sampler, etc.) is desired.  Hull mounting of AMLR program supplied acoustic transducers is required.  The Government is soliciting industry reaction/level in the above project, specifically as it relates to the following:  (1) types of vessels that may be available, including technical and operational capabilities and required vessel modifications to conduct the various research operations above; (2) rough order of magnitude cost estimates and desired contract pricing arrangements; (3) ports of origin of potentially available vessels and transit time to/from the research area.  

Industry comment on additional factors that should be addressed in the solicitation to encourage submission of a proposal is welcome.  Written responses should be received by February 23, 2004.  All responsible sources may respond to the Request for Information.  As a result of analyzing responses to the Request for Information, NOAA may determine that a solicitation be issued.  If a solicitation is issued, an additional synopsis of the procurement will be published prior to the issuance.

<SUBJECT>D -- MONK and MCBEND Software License and Support Agreement
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regualtory Commission (NRC) intends tonegotiate a sole-source contract with AEA Technology Engineering Services, Incorporated (herein referred to as AEAT, for a procurement entitled, "MONK AND MCBEND SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT." The proposed effort will require the contractor to provide the NRC with continued software support and license agreement for MONK and MCBEND codes.  The MONK criticality code and MCBEND shielding code (MONK and MCBEND) uniquely meet the NRC’s near-term needs for independent analysis tools in that they differ significantly from comparable U.S. codes and utilize nuclear data libraries derived from different evaluated data files and processed by different codes.  Both of these proprietary codes are well documented, tested, and supported, and have user interfaces that allow rapid development and checking of input models.  The codes also provide unique output features that facilitate comparison of the computed neutronics and radiation physics characteristics of the systems in question to those of the experimental benchmarks used in validating the codes, modeling methods, and data libraries.  These and other code features, such as a quasi-pointwise representation of the resolved energy domain and a probability table treatment of important unresolved resonances, meet the NRC staff’s requirements for performing fully independent and credible safety analyses with a reasonable allotment of time and resources.  There are presently no other known sources of codes that fully meet the NRC staff’s near-term needs for performing independent criticality and shielding calculations.  The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with AEAT is found under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other typw of services will satisfy NRC's requirement.  The proposed period of performance is one year from the date of award, with the option to extend the period of performance four additional one-year periods. The NAICS code is 511210.  The standard for this requirement is $21 million.  This notice is not a request for proposal.  A determination not to compete this requirement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested parties must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs to Carolyn Cooper, Contract Specialist, Mail Stop T-7-I-2, or fax to (301)415-8157 not later than February 12, 2004.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

With your proposal include complete mailing address, street address if different from mailing address, phone number, fax number, and email address.  The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Pacific Northwest Regional Office, has a requirement for the Green Springs Power Plant Rotor Refurbishing, Ashland, Oregon.  The generator is a critical component of the overall irrigation system for this area of Oregon.  Water deliveries must be maintained.  The downtime for this unit must be as short as possible; therefore, the Contractor shall remove the pole bodies from the rotor, refurbish and factory test the field windings, return them to the power plant, connect the pole bodies to the rotor rim, and field test the assembled field windings by April 23, 2004, or earlier.  The Price Schedule is included in the Solicitation (#04SP101562) on our website as cited above.  Work Statement (Scope of Work) - The Contractor shall (a) remove field poles including the field windings from the rotor rim, (b) package and ship field poles and windings between Green Springs Power Plant and the Contractor's repair facility, (c) examine the field winding and report any findings that may cause low insulation resistance, (d) remove the existing insulation from the field coils, clean and prepare the pole bodies to accept the refurbished field coils, clean and inspect the copper turns, apply new turn and ground insulation to the field coils and pole bodies, re-install field windings on pole bodies, (e) factory test the refurbished field coils, (f) install the refurbished pole assemblies on the rotor rim and complete all connections, (g) test the complete field winding in accordance with these requirements and applicable industry standards.  Delivery-The Government will have the rotor removed and on the rotor pedestal by the end of March 24, 2004, and the Contractor may take possession of the rotor at 8:00 a.m. on March 25, 2004.  The Contractor shall have all contract work completed by the end of April 23, 2004 for rotor placement in the generator by the Government.  Type and Rating - The generator is an outdoor, conventional type.  It is a vertical-shaft, synchronous machine manufactured by Oerlikon, serial number 931032, type SGV 450-240.12.  Nameplate ratings will be available in the Solicitation on our website (cited above).  Operating History - Green Springs Power Plant is located in southern Oregon near the city of Ashland.  The generator has been in service since 1960 (the generator armature was rewound in 1993 and the field winding re-insulated in 1998).  Work and Materials furnished by the Government - The Government will perform all work associated with removing and installing the rotor.  The Government will provide a crane and operator to load and unload individual pole pieces.  The crane is not to be used to pull wedges out of the rotor.  The crane can be used to hold the pole pieces as the wedges are removed, and to remove the poles once they are free.  Work and Materials furnished by the Contractor - The Contractor shall perform all work required to remove the field pole assemblies from the rotor rim, and prepare and package the field poles for shipment.  The Contractor shall be responsible for shipping the pole assemblies to and from the repair facilities.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, and equipment necessary to remove, package individual poles, ship, insulate, install, factory test, field test, and paint the field coils.  The Contractor shall provide adequate housing to remove or re-install poles during inclement weather.  The Contractor shall provide adequate protection of the rotor overnight and during the period the poles are off the rotor.  Photo #5 and Photo #6 (photos and drawings are available on our website) show the tools used in 1998 to remove the wedges that hold the pole pieces to the rotor rim.  A 30-ton ram was used because it was the smallest ram size accommodating the 3/8-inch all-thread rod.  The block shown was used to support the ram.  The wedges are below the rotor surface, and the metal block had to fit the flat surface around the wedge because of the limited space.  Wedge dimensions are shown on Drawing 415M-D-3-77; they fit into a machined slot in the pole pieces.  Each pole has four wedges, two in the top and two in the bottom.  There is insufficient room to weld pieces of metal to the wedges for pulling as is the general practice for larger units; instead there are 3/8-inch threaded holes part way down the center of the wedges.  The Government purchased high strength threaded rods but breakage was not uncommon while attempting wedge removal.  The poles were supported by the crane as the wedges were removed.  Before removing the coils from the pole bodies and at the factory, the Contractor shall examine the overall condition of the field coils/winding.  The Contractor shall remove the rotor fan, brake ring, and any other parts in order to remove the rotor poles and then re-install as part of re-installing the rotor poles.  The Contractor shall remove the field coils and all insulating material from the pole bodies.  All insulation shall be removed from the field coils.  New epoxy winding insulation, Class F, per ANSI Standard C50.10 shall be installed.  All insulating materials, sleeves, collars, braces, blocking, and spacers shall be replaced and shall be Class F.  Prior to the installation of the refurbished field coils on the pole bodies, the Contractor shall clean, inspect, and repair the pole bodies.  All amortisseur winding connections shall be inspected and cleaned.  The Contractor shall replace all wedges damaged during removal or re-installation of the field poles.  The Contractor shall install the refurbished field coils on the pole bodies.  Insulating collars shall be adequately supported at all points, shall compensate for any shrinkage in the insulation system, and shall maintain adequate pressure on the field coils to prevent movement.  The Contractor shall connect the existing field leads to the assembled field winding.  Inter-pole connector re-design or new flexible connectors must be approved by the Government.  The coil/pole assembly shall be capable of withstanding all mechanical stresses imposed by the maximum runaway speed of the unit.  The Contractor shall clean and touch up the rotor poles after re-insulation.  The Contractor shall provide a list of recommended cleaning solutions and methods for cleaning the field windings.  All insulation materials removed from the field poles and coils shall become the property of the Contractor, and shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.  Testing-Prior to shipping of any poles back from the factory, the Contractor shall submit factory test results for Government approval.  To facilitate approximate static balancing after reassembly by the Government, the Contractor shall document the weight of each pole assembly immediately after removal from the rotor, the weight of each bare pole piece after removal of the windings in the factory, and the weight of each complete pole assembly before shipment to the installation site.  All testing shall conform to the following standards: IEEE 43? (2000), and IEEE 115? (1995) and ANSI C50.10? (1997).  The Contractor shall submit formal test reports (within 30 days after final testing) showing the results of both the factory and final field testing, including insulation resistance, winding resistance, inter-pole connection resistance, pole drop, and polarity tests performed on the field windings, and shall state the values of test voltages used.  Field windings failing any of the above tests shall be reworked and retested.  Copies of all test data, reports, measurements and drawings (including any new field winding diagrams) shall be provided to the Government.  Factory testing:  Testing of the refurbished field windings shall include an insulation resistance test, AC hi-pot test, and polarity test on each coil.  The tests will demonstrate the effect of the new winding insulation.  The refurbished field windings shall meet the minimum insulation resistance requirements of IEEE 43?.  The Contractor shall notify the Government 72 hours in advance to observe factory testing.  Field testing:  Testing of the field windings shall include insulation resistance and pole drop tests.  All new materials shall be designed to operate under all normal machine conditions and speeds up to the runaway speed.  The refurbished field windings shall meet the minimum insulation resistance requirements of IEEE 43?.  Pole drop tests shall not deviate more than plus or minus 5% from the average.  Winding resistance and inter-pole connection resistance shall be measured with a micro-ohm meter.  Drawings-(are available on our website). The manufacturer's drawings will be available for the contractor to use during this work.  The Contractor shall confirm all pertinent dimensions shown on the drawings.  Reclamation assumes no responsibility for the actual dimensions of the equipment to be re-insulated.  Hazardous Materials-The insulation of the existing field windings is not expected to contain asbestos.  It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to test for the presence of asbestos or other hazardous materials associated with this type of insulation refurbishment.  If asbestos is found, the Government shall be notified for consideration of an adjustment in the contract.  The Contractor shall follow all Federal, State, and local safety regulations for removal, transportation, and disposal of materials containing asbestos, including monitoring the work area.   Warranty-The Contractor shall provide a one year warranty on the refurbished field windings and pole assemblies, covering, but not limited to, cracking of insulation, and coil movement.  Any new materials including pole collars and coil-to-coil connections and all workmanship shall be covered under the warranty.  Security-While at the job site, all Contractor personnel shall prominently wear a company identification badge clearly identifying the employee and the Contractor.  Such identification shall be worn at all times the Contractor's personnel are on the Government project site.  Where access is designated through gates or doors which are normally locked, the gates or doors shall be kept locked.  Contractor personnel shall not be permitted to enter established or designated restricted areas unless authorized by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  Such entry shall be accordance with, and subject to, the security regulations established for the area.  The Contractor shall ensure that its personnel do not enter these areas unless authorized as set forth above.  Site Visit-No formal site visit has been scheduled.  If you would like to request a site visit, please contact the Green Springs Power Plant at 541-482-2266 to schedule a date and time on a Saturday or Sunday.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only Solicitation; proposals are being requested on or before 4 P.M. local prevailing time on Febuary 26, 2004 and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. SOLICITATION NUMBER N1191040004 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Wayside Metal Exhibit Base Fabrication.  This is a total Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 339950.  Size standard is 500 employees.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-18. It is anticipated that up to three awards will be made on or about March 17, 2004. Award(s) will be for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price Contract for one year with four one year option periods.  The Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum workload of $5,000 and the maximum workload limit will be $200,000 each year. If a Contractor declines to propose or declines work offered by the National Park Service at any time during the contract period, the estimated amount of the project will be subtracted against the minimum guaranteed workload in this contract. BACKGROUND: As one of the nation's principal conservation agencies, the National Park Service (NPS) has the responsibility to protect some of our most treasured natural and cultural resources. In order to preserve these treasures it is important that they be interpreted in ways that help NPS visitors experience them, understand them, and appreciate their value.  It is also important that those who visit National Park sites be assured that their visits are safe and enjoyable.  Since its earliest days, the NPS has relied on a variety of interpretive media to assist in the effort to protect its resources and to assure the pleasure and safety of its visitors.  Among the various media used by the NPS, wayside exhibits provide the most direct interpretation of park sites and features.  Because they are located in a park's outdoor environment, "waysides" offer immediate -- and readily available -- sources of information tailored to a specific place and time.  No other interpretive medium can match the power of direct association of information and resource, or the convenience of on-site location.  Currently, NPS wayside exhibit panels are produced in a limited number of standard sizes and configurations.  Refer to the following web address for specifications:  http://www.nps.gov/waysite/utilities/idiq/hardware.htm  Exhibit panels are usually made in either of three sizes (24" x 36", 24" x 42", or 36" x 48") and in either of two materials (fiberglass embedded screen imaged paper or porcelain-enameled steel panels.) Both types of panels are held in support structures (typically called "bases") that are fabricated from aluminum components, sandblasted, and painted in one of a limited number of colors.  Bases are usually fabricated according to standard NPS designs. Occasionally standard base designs are adapted, or original designs are created, to suit unusual installation circumstances.  Comprehensive shop drawings are provided.  Upon completion of the exhibit base fabrication, the Contractor will ship the finished exhibits to the appropriate park for installation by National Park Service personnel.  The contract period will be for one year with the option of extending the contract for four additional one-year periods. PURPOSE: This contract is to meet the exhibit base fabrication requirements of the Department of the Interior, National Park Service and occasionally other agencies of the Government, by providing exhibit base fabrication and exhibit base materials that are fully compatible with required design and production methods, standards, and technologies.  All work performed under this contract will be directed by the issuance of Task Orders in accordance with procedures outlined in Section G of the contract.  In no event will the Government be responsible for any work performed by the Contractor that is not undertaken pursuant to a Task Order authorized by the Contracting Officer.  SCOPE OF WORK: Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and facilities (except as otherwise specified), necessary for the fabrication of NPS wayside exhibit bases.  When fabricating wayside bases, the Contractor shall utilize NPS base design standards. Comprehensive shop drawings and written specifications for all standard bases will be provided by the NPS and are available at http://www.nps.gov/waysite/utilities/idiq/hardware.htm  On those occasions when custom bases are required, the NPS will also provide complete drawings and specifications.   A.

<DESC>Description   NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends to award a sole source contract to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  This contract shall provide for a single Small Boat Operator Trainer and shall include option items for building, deploying and supporting six (6) additional trainers.  The trainer is in support of the Coast Guard’s small boat fleet with such boats as the 47 foot Motor Life Boat (47 ft MLB) and Response Boat Small.  

The Small Boat Operator Trainer shall include the performance capabilities of the 47-foot Motor Life Boat and Response Boat Small (RB-S), the ability to model additional small boats, provide basic instructional capabilities, support towing and station keeping, provide for planing and non-planing speeds, and include a high fidelity sea state that is integrated with the visual display and small boat performance models.  

CSC has a field Virtual Boat Trainer that currently addresses the requirements for the Small Boat Operator Trainer, and is in use by a variety of Department of Defense activities.  The Virtual Boat Trainer is database driven, has a variety of geographical databases, towing of boats, and instructional features.  This trainer also has an open architecture that allows the cost effective inclusion of additional capabilities such as the realistic modeling and visualization of sea states and planning hull modeling.
 
The system upgrade shall be completed within 10 months. This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to CSCwhose software remains proprietary and solely owned by CSC.  To award this contract to another vendor would result in a failure to meet delivery schedule and excess costs to the government.
