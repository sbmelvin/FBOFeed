<SUBJECT>A -- Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscopes (NGIMG)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-02
<RESPDATE>121704
<ARCHDATE>10132005
<CONTACT>Clark Nguyen, Program Manager, MTO, Phone 5712184586, Fax 7036962206, Email cnguyen@darpa.mil
<DESC>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscopes (NGIMG). The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementations of NGIMG, with the ultimate objective being the realization of tiny, low-power, rotation rate sensors capable of achieving performance commensurate with requirements for GPS-denied navigation of small platforms, including individual soldiers, unmanned (micro) air vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and even tiny (e.g., insect-sized) robots. By harnessing the advantages of micro-scale miniaturization, the NGIMG program is expected to yield tiny (if not chip-scale) gyroscopes with navigation-grade performance characteristics, such as (but not limited to):

(1)	Angle random walk (ARW) better than 0.001 degree/square root(hours).
(2)	Bias drift better than 0.01 degree/hr.
(3)	Scale factor stability better than 40 ppm.
(4)	Full scale range greater than 500 degrees/s.
(5)	Bandwidth from 1-300 Hz.
(6)	Temperature range from -55 degrees C to 85 degrees C.
(7)	Overall size less than 1 cubic cm, not including the power source, but including control electronics and any required device packaging.
(8)	Power consumption less than 5 mW.

Note that the above are merely meant to provide rough order of magnitude expectations of what is ultimately deemed possible by the end of the NGIMG program, and are not to be construed as rigid program specifications.

Although methods for rate sensing based on vibrating micromechanical mass-spring systems have successfully achieved tactical-grade performance, with bias stabilities nearing 1 degree/hr, they have done so with considerable difficulty. Pursuant to navigation-grade performance, arguments can be made to justify the use of similar approaches, but if such approaches are evolutionary in nature, they will be of only limited interest here. Instead, NGIMG approaches based on novel or alternative strategies or phenomena, not yet miniaturized using MEMS technologies, are of most interest, especially those capable of greatly enhancing the bias stability—perhaps the most difficult of the navigation-grade needs—of the proposed gyroscope. As such, research topics and activities relevant to the implementation of NGIMG might include, but are not limited to: (1) buoyant or levitated microstructures, or other approaches to isolating the sensor from unwanted inputs so as to minimize bias drift; (2) atomistic mechanisms for inertial sensing; (3) micro-optical techniques; (4) micro-fluidic approaches (both liquid and gas); (5) resonant or acoustic microstructures that sense inertial inputs through previously unexplored mechanisms; and (6) technologies that integrate the inertial sensing mechanisms together with transistor electronics.

Among the more compelling drivers behind the NGIMG program is the need for portable navigation sensors for future small or miniature platforms. As such, low power consumption is as important as small size, if not more so, in any chosen implementation. Part of the impetus behind the technical approach of the NGIMG program stems from the recognition that micro-scale miniaturization in all physical domains generally provides advantages (beyond size reduction) in speed, power consumption, and other variables, that make certain approaches more attractive on the micro-scale that would otherwise not be options on the macro-scale. For example, the enhanced degree of thermal isolation achievable via MEMS implementation is expected to offer thermal resistances and capacitances that enable substantial reductions in the power consumption for approaches that require heating or cooling. In addition, levitation is expected to require much less power on the micro-scale than on the macro, perhaps making it practical only on the micro-scale. Although miniaturization can lead to performance loss—a fact well known to those experienced with traditional approaches to micro-scale inertial sensing—the performance advantages it offers can often counteract losses to the point of achieving a net gain in overall performance. Clearly, approaches that benefit most (or lose least) from scaling are of most interest, here.

NGIMG-enabled devices with characteristics similar to that listed above and achieved via low cost, batch fabrication methods are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, the sheer portability of the rotation rate sensors sought by the NGIMG program should introduce a host of new applications and deployment scenarios, including wearable inertial measurement units (IMU’s) for dismounted warriors capable of GPS-denied navigation for lengthy periods; small IMU’s for unmanned air and underwater vehicles, and for guidance of small, long-range munitions; and tiny IMU’s for insect-like robots intended for a variety of future applications, including first warning perimeter sensing. Together with chip-scale atomic clocks (CSAC’s) and location-tracking algorithms that harness additional kinetic information (e.g., biokinetic), chip-scale NGIMG’s should allow man-portable dead-reckoning devices with unprecedented precision, with and without GPS. By enabling a swelling of applications, as illustrated above, miniaturization via NGIMG technology is expected to generate a need for high volume manufacturing that, together with wafer-level batch fabrication methods enabled by MEMS technology, should substantially lower the cost of miniature navigation systems, and thus, further fuel expansion of the application suite for NGIMG technology.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscope program will consist of a Phase I effort (12 months) followed by optional Phase II (12 months), Phase III (12 months), and Phase IV (18 months) periods, for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD. Awards are expected to be made during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2005.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II, Phase III, and/or Phase IV, should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  The formation of multi-disciplinary teams consisting of industry, academia, and/or national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged, especially given the sub-system flavor of the MGA program. A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-05-02/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil

National Defense Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences (CEROS)
73-4460 Queen Kaahumanu Highway
Suite 111
Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 96740
DATE: 08 October 2004
CEROS solicitation (CEROS-CORE-05-01) for Ocean Technology Development, Application and Demonstration in support of Maritime Military Operations including but not limited to Shallow Water Surveillance Technologies, Ocean Environmental Preservation, New Ocean Platform and Ship Concepts, Ocean Instruments and Engineering Tools, and Unique Properties of the Deep Ocean Environment.  Point of contact: William A. Friedl, (808) 327-4310. 
The National Defense Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences (CEROS) is soliciting proposals for concept development and demonstration of ocean technologies for military maritime purposes.  Of particular interest are proposals for development and demonstration of advanced technologies for Shallow Water Surveillance, Ocean Environmental Preservation, New Ocean Platform and Ship Concepts, Ocean Instruments and Engineering Tools, and Unique Properties of the Deep Ocean Environment.  Innovative concepts and new approaches are being sought to advance technology, enhance capabilities and infrastructure in Hawaii, and demonstrate beneficial maritime military utility and commercial development potential for the Department of Defense.  CEROS will execute the program outlined in this solicitation contingent upon funding amount and availability.
Subject areas of interest include:
1.	Shallow Water Surveillance Technologies, emphasizing innovative approaches to collection, processing and presentation of information from and about the maritime operational environment. 
2.	Ocean Environmental Preservation, emphasizing innovative system development and demonstrations for ocean environmental sensing, remediation, monitoring and control. 
3.	New Ocean Platform and Ship Concepts, emphasizing development and demonstration of innovative designs, advanced structures or improved techniques. 
4.	Ocean Measurement Instrumentation and Ocean Engineering Tools, emphasizing development and demonstration of advanced sensors, innovative undersea systems or facilities, and new techniques for undersea measurement, modeling, prediction and data exploitation. 
5.	Unique Properties of the Deep Ocean Environment, emphasizing new techniques to identify or exploit unique properties, conditions, materials, products or potential of the deep ocean for enhanced maritime operational capability. 
CEROS plans to make up to $6M available to fund proposals in response to this solicitation.  Specific funding depends on funding availability and out-year funding has not been defined.  Multiple, firm fixed-price level of effort contract awards, not exceeding $1M each, are anticipated as a result of this solicitation, contingent upon funding.  CEROS encourages proposals involving multiple entities (teaming) to leverage capabilities, develop technology in Hawaii, and address priority Department of Defense maritime technology needs.  Non-commercial, not-for-profit and/or government entities may be part of project teams but the team must be headed by a commercial enterprise.
Contract awards shall be based on proposal merit and funding availability.  Proposed work should be structured with a base period of performance of 6 to 12 months.  Options to extend the period of performance for up to 12 additional months may be included in submissions to CEROS but incremental or follow-on funding of any such option is not guaranteed.  CEROS may choose to fund such optional phases without additional competitive submissions from the offeror, contingent upon anticipated funding availability and results from the initial years effort and only upon specific recommendation and approval from DARPA.  CEROS may choose to fund all, some or none of the optional phases included in submissions in response to this solicitation.  The commitment of out-year funding to optional phases will not exceed $1.0M.
CEROS will use a two-step submission process to formulate a Core Program from projects submitted under this solicitation.  The first step requires submission of a Proposal Abstract.  CEROS will evaluate all abstracts against the evaluation criteria herein without regard to other abstracts submitted.  For the second step, CEROS will request full technical and cost proposals from selected offerors for proposed efforts deemed as best qualified for potential negotiation under this solicitation.  CEROS will specify the format for full proposals in the invitation to submit more detailed project information.  No selection for negotiation or subsequent funding will be made under this solicitation without full technical and cost proposals.
CEROS anticipates that initial contractor selections will be made during March 2005 from submissions received by CEROS through the website specified herein by 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 10 November 2004.  However, properly formatted proposal abstracts received after initial contractor selections and before 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 08 March 2005 will be considered for award if funding is available. 
PROPOSAL PROCESS
To be considered in the initial contract award period, offerors shall submit an unclassified abstract of the proposed effort to CEROS by 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 10 November 2004.  The abstract should provide an overview of the project and associated costs.  To be eligible for consideration, the offeror must be a commercial enterprise.  Abstracts shall be submitted electronically through the website www.ceros.org/fy05abstract.html according to the procedure described therein.  The submissions shall be prepared in either PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible formats and each project  shall have a separate submission.  Abstracts submitted by any means other than the specified website will be disregarded.  CEROS will attempt to respond no later than 23 December 2004, to companies whose project abstracts are received on or before 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 10 November 2004.
Abstracts shall be prepared in the following format: 8.5 x 11 inch pages, single or double spaced, in at least ten point type, with margins not less than one inch and pages numbered.  The abstract shall consist of a cover page and up to four additional pages of project information, including figures and tables.  Abstracts exceeding 5 pages will be rejected.  The Cover Page shall include the following: title of the proposed effort; intended product or result; name, company affiliation, phone number, fax number, and electronic and postal mailing addresses of the Principal Investigator and Administrative Point of Contact; proposed period of performance; funding required to produce the proposed products; names and affiliations of sub-contractors and co-investigators; and special requirements or considerations.  The balance of the Abstract should clearly describe the projects Problem, Product, Process, Importance and Price.  The Abstract shall include the following sections, each clearly labeled:
 A.  Problem, stating the technical problem and federal Department of Defense (DoD) maritime technical need addressed, describing the technical rationale for the proposed effort, and summarizing the technical objectives of the work.
 B.  Products, describing the works expected results and planned deliverables and discussing the anticipated military and commercial applications of the technology, plans for follow-on development or technical transitions, and patents or other intellectual property that may result from the work.
 C.  Process, describing the planned technical approach and methods to be used, including the works schedule, task assignments, and major developmental milestones and summarizing special capabilities of the work team, planned risk mitigation efforts, and special techniques or facilities to be used for the proposed work.
 D.  Importance, stating the specific technical advances and innovation that will be demonstrated by the work, describing the works anticipated residual benefits to maritime military and/or commercial marine technology and discussing the advances to state-of-the-art technology expected and their technical relevance to CEROS program objectives.
 E. Price, consisting of an estimate for a firm, fixed price level of effort project, including the principal cost elements, direct material costs, direct labor costs, other direct costs, indirect costs, facilities capital cost of money, and profit or fee.
 The Abstract may also contain any other information deemed germane to the proposed effort, such as descriptions of leveraged assets, co-funding arrangements, consultant commitments, or technical references.
EVALUATION CRITERIA 
The following criteria apply to both Abstracts and full proposals requested under this solicitation.  CEROS will select for award those projects offering the best value and, except for the first criterion (item A), will give equal weight to each of the following criteria.  Item A will receive twice the weight of any other criterion in the evaluation. 
 A. Quality.  Technical quality of the proposed effort and its potential to successfully address the technical problem involved and to advance the technical state-of-the-art and maritime military technical competence; relevance to DoD technical needs and the CEROS mission; and potential importance to intended recipients of the developed technology.

Offerors are advised that if awarded a contract under this solicitation, offerors shall, upon award of the contract, furnish proof of compliance with the requirements of section 3-122-112, Hawaii Administrative Rules.  This shall include Chapter 237, tax clearance; Chapter 383, unemployment insurance; Chapter 386, workers compensation; Chapter 392, temporary disability insurance; and Chapter 393, prepaid health care.  In addition, to be eligible for award, offerors must either be registered and incorporated or organized under the laws of the State of Hawaii; or be registered to do business in the State of Hawaii.
Pursuant to section 103-10, Hawaii Revised Statutes, contract payments shall be contingent upon the receipt of federal funds.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA will be hosting an Industry Day conference on 8 November 2004 at the Gray Research Building, Quantico, VA to provide an overview of the Marine Corps Enterprise Information Technology Services (MCEITS).  The objective of this conference is to provide background information on this IT infrastructure modernization.  The current status of the program for FY05 is for the strategic planning and definition of the technical architecture.  R&D funding is not scheduled to be provided for the development of the net-centric services and development until FY06.   

Background:

The Department of Defense (DoD) is committed to transforming the existing globally interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities, associated processes, and personnel to a Net-Centric Operations and Warfare (NCOW) environment that will disseminate and manage information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel.  This commitment includes major transformation capabilities to be provided to the joint community by programs such as the Global Information Grid (GIG) Bandwidth-Expansion (GIG-BE), Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), and end-to-end information assurance (IA).  When implemented, these programs will provide the Marine and/or Joint Force Commander an unprecedented level of battlespace awareness by providing end-to-end information capabilities for accessing timely and relevant critical information in order to accomplish all assigned mission objectives.
These end-to-end sets of information capabilities, defined in DoD Directive (DoDD) 8100.1 as the GIG, include all owned and leased communications and computing systems and services, software (including applications), data, security services, and other associated services necessary to achieve Information Superiority (IS).  The focus of IS is to provide an understandable, multidimensional, real-time, fused view of the battlespace to the future Marine and/or Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander by providing information capabilities that will support the full range of military operations, including the highest intensity conflict.  These capabilities are also required to support all DoD, National Security, and related Intelligence Community strategic, operational, tactical, and business missions and functions, in war and peace, from all operating bases, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile platforms, and deployed sites.  It also includes National Security Systems (NSS) as defined in section 5142 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. These capabilities also include interfaces to coalition, allied, and non-DoD users and systems.

The MCEITS Universal Needs Statement (UNS) [03169IT], approved in January 2004, established the Marine Corps’ need for a modernized Information Technology infrastructure.  The Marine Corps' Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is characterized by a highly decentralized set of applications, web-sites, and databases supported by a manpower intensive workforce. Standardization, security, and system configuration management has proven extremely difficult. The Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), a component of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), is expected to bring improvements to network connectivity and throughput. The Marine Corps must leverage these enhanced capabilities to realize a greater return-on-investment (ROI) with respect to NMCI. Maintaining disparate IT staffs at numerous locations across the Marine Corps is expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable. Certain IT services are common to many users of the MCEN. These common services include such things as messaging, security, collaboration, infrastructure management, application development, testing and certification services, help desk support, continuity of operations planning (COOP), and perhaps most significantly access to shared data. The Marine Corps needs to develop a common IT enterprise services environment that consists of platforms to support shared services, an Enterprise Shared Data Environment (ESDE), web-based portal technology, and enterprise class data centers. 
For the Marine Corps to maintain its combat overmatch capabilities in future operations, the Marine Corps Enterprise IT environment shall focus on providing capabilities that support tactical and support operations with a particular emphasis on the expeditionary nature of the Marine Corps warfighting operations. To establish the Marine Corps’ net-centric environment, a new IT architecture must be transformed from the old environment using network-centric systems engineering concepts.  It must be deployed and maintained using the modular and interoperable architecture of the GIG.  The MCEITS program and framework will represent the U. S. Marine Corps (USMC) transformation strategy to provide and use NCOW capabilities.  It is the intent of the USMC to meet GIG and GIG Enterprise Services (GES) strategic plans and technological guidance in accordance with the GIG Capstone Requirements Document (CRD).

Implementation of MCEITS capabilities will provide this infrastructure and is the instrument that will enable the Marine Corps to use and provide net centric warfighting capabilities.  MCEITS will align with, use, and mutually support the GIG’s globally interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities that will provide information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and supporting personnel.  The Marine Corps Enterprise “to-be” and existing environments will eventually converge via NCOW concepts to include all Marine Corps strategic, operational, tactical, and business missions and functions by providing information capabilities fused from all operating locations.  This environment will create the ability to ingest, analyze, and distribute key information in real-time across the DoD’s global operations.

Conference:

Attendance to this Industry Day is recommended for all vendors interested in MCEITS;  Hardware and Software vendors, in addition to System Integrator Vendors.  Communications related to this program will be via the Contracting Officer at isi_contracts@mcsc.usmc.mil only.  Identify MCEITS Industry Day in the subject line of the email.  Individuals interested in attending industry day must submit the following information, no later than 3 November 2004, to isi_contracts.usmc.mil:

<DESC>The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health,  is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AID epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The Division of AIDS intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center under Contract No. N01-A1-85354, scheduled to expire on September 20, 2005. This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  The primary focus of this solicitation is to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DIAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies. The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, and assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.   Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the Contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base Contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the Contract, and such an increase in the Contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the Contract years.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Most, but not all, Sites are currently linked through an electronic network which is used to transmit virology data from the Sites to a remote Central Database.  Sites are also using a customized laboratory data management system (LDMS) that tracks specimens, provides assay templates, calculates derived quantities, produces reports, and generates data files for export from the Site.  The successful offeror will be required to provide some VQA-related information through the DAIDS-ES.  While some of this may be accomplished through a link from DAIDS-ES to the VQA web site, some data may need to be shared by the VQA, with DAIDS ES, in which case data sharing agreements, standards, etc. will be required.  Specifically the contractor shall be required to perform the following: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; 4) disseminate VQA technical and scientific data; 5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; 6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options; and 7) implement a transition plan at the end of the contract.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about August 15, 2005 to August 14, 2012. This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 29, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award or a contract.  See Numbered Note 26.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

The EPA has developed specific emissions control technologies on  this particular type of engine and wants to continue using it for this development work.  This make and model of engine will also provide a more reliable and stable test for the round-robin testing program at this level.  	 This acquisition is designated as a small business set-aside under NAICS  code 333618. A written RFQ, PR-OH-05-00017, is anticipated to be issued on or about October 19, 2004. Interested and responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to the RFQ which shall be considered by the Agency.   The Government will award an order resulting from the RFQ to the  responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ, meets  the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW), schedule and delivery.   The order resulting from this acquisition will be firm-fixed price.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the RFQ, but will provide  electronic copies upon request. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number and email address. All responsible sources may submit a request to receive the RFQ to harris.yvonne@epa.gov or by fax at (513) 487-2107.  See Note 1

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Sources Sought to provide COTS software for a Learning Management System

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is issuing a Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis to seek qualified sources capable of supplying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software for a Learning Management System.  This procurement will implement the USPTO 21st Century Strategic Plan initiative calling for a certification program to ensure that the U.S. Patent and Trademark employees have the knowledge, skills, and ability to support USPTO goals. The procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) which is available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/. Under PTAG, the USPTO is authorized to limit the number of offerors to achieve maximum reasonable competition. Upon review of the responses to this Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis and if the USPTO determines that it is in the best interests of the USPTO to proceed with an open market acquisition, the USPTO will utilize a two-step streamlined acquisition approach in accordance with PTAG.  Step 1:  Review Capability Statements and downselect to no more than 5 most highly qualified vendors. Step 2:  Issue RFP to the vendors selected from Step 1 and award to the offeror providing the best value. Those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised. USPTO may elect to request product demonstrations as part of the follow-on technical evaluation. USPTO may also elect, in accordance with the PTAG, to negotiate only with the most highly rated vendor in Step 2.   THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED.  IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR STEP 2, INTERESTED VENDORS MUST RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  

The USPTO is currently investigating training strategies and establishing USPTO training policies that comply and reflect the President’s Management Agenda, personnel statutes, executive orders, judicial precedents, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Department of Commerce (DOC) decisions and directives and USPTO personnel management decisions and directives to design and develop guidelines, systems, and standards for employee career development, training, and occupational career management. 

The technical requirements of the Learning Management System are outlined in Attachment A. Systems development and integration is considered outside the scope of this procurement. 

Interested vendors shall submit a capability statement, not to exceed 50 pages that demonstrates the offeror’s qualifications and capability to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements which are outlined in Attachment A.   The capability statement should address the following:  (1) past performance, (2) technical capability and (3) price.  

In determining past performance vendors shall provide customer points of contact, description of the requirement, cost, performance accomplishments and references. In determining technical capability USPTO may test and technically evaluate the proposed systems based on the following factors: security (data encryption and integrity), proven implementation, ease of maintenance, scalability, performance, high availability, component reusability, and compatibility with USPTO architecture.  Specify if software can integrate with IBM WebSphere.  Include benchmarks for each platform supported, including concurrent user statistics, if available.  Multiple approaches are welcomed.  In determining price, vendors will submit price schedules. Ultimate vendor selection will be based upon Best Value as follows: technical and past performance when combined is more important than price.  

Prospective offerors must respond to this Pre-solicitation announcement in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  Capability statements shall be submitted electronically via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format to hope.smith@uspto.gov no later than November 19, 2004 at 5:00pm.   The USPTO will confirm receipt of all submissions.  Late submissions will not be accepted.

<DESC>Modification 1
Classification code should be:
C - Architect and Engineering Services
--------------------------------------------------------------
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 9-story Courthouse, located at 5th and Walnut Street, in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1939. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  

For each reference project, provide a contact including name, title, address, phone and fax numbers.  

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the SF 330 must be reflected in a subcontracting plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan should be submitted with the SF330 in Stage II. The small business size standard for this procurement under NAICS code 541310 is $4,000,000 based on average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years. Contact your local SBA office for further information. Firms seeking consideration for this contact shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible. An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. 

Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in this announcement are invited to respond by submitting six (6) complete copies of the entire Stage I submittal including the portfolios, SF330 (Information just of the Design firm), and a letter of interest identifying this announcement by solicitation number arriving at the designated location no later than November 5, 2004 by 12:00 p.m. (Central Time).  The information is to be submitted to the attention of Jason Gerloff at GSA, PBS, Property Development (5PE2), 230 South Dearborn Street, Room 3512, DPN 35-6; Chicago, Illinois, 60604-1696, (312) 886-1542.  The following information must be on the outside of each submittal package: (1) Solicitation No. and Title, (2) Due date and (3) Closing time. Late responses are subject to FAR provision 52.215.10. If applicable, each SF330 submitted should make the following certification as the last entry in Block 30: “I hereby certify the firm (or joint firm) and consultants listed for this project meet the geographic locations stated in the FBO announcement for this solicitation.”  In Block 9 of the Standard Form 330, Part II, Page 6, specify only current W-2 payroll (non-contract) personnel of each firm. In Block F, G & H of Standard Form 330, Part I, the A-E Firm MUST respond to the FOUR (4) EVALUATION CRITERIA stated in the FedBizOpps announcement for this STAGE 1, Request For Qualifications. A follow-up listing of firms to be selected for Stage II and interviews will appear as a modification to this synopsis posting.  All other non-selected A/E firms and consultants interested in participating on the design team should submit a one page letter of interest only, which will be forwarded on to the short-listed firms. FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. Award of this contract is contingent upon receipt of design funds and successful negotiation of a reasonable fee.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A-E firms will not be reimbursed for expenses or efforts under Stage I and/ or Stage II submissions.

<DESC>Prophet is the principal ground-based brigade tactical SIGINT/EW (Electronic Warfare) and IEW (Intelligence and EW) sensor system, which provides force protection and intelligence support to the US Army Division, Brigade, Stryker Brigade Unit of Acti on (SBUA), Armored Cavalry Regiments (ACR), and subordinate commanders. Prophet has three operation modes in the tactical environment that include the dismounted (Man-pack) operational mode, the High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mounted version that operates in either Stationary (elevated antenna mast) or On-The-Move (OTM) modes. Prophet searches and monitors the radio frequency spectrum, performs signal collection (intercept), Direction Finding (DF (Line-Of-Bearing (LOB) only)), and stat ionary jamming (with a directional jamming antenna) against enemy tactical emitters. Prophet is tasked by and interfaces with Prophet Control (PC), which is located with the supported commands Analysis and Control Team (ACT). Prophet is organic to U.S. Ar my light and heavy division, and deploys with the combat brigades, SBUAs, and ACRs. Prophet System provides Actionable Intelligence (also called Force Protection information) to the forward deployed tactical commanders. The dismounted Man-pack version is  capable of early entry or airborne insertion, and can quickly be converted to the mounted version after the Prophet HMMWVs have been deployed into the battlespace. The HMMWV mounted Prophet has an automatic antenna mast that elevates the antenna subsystem  to a 7-meter height (for Stationary operation only) above ground level (AGL). This higher antenna elevation increases Prophets DF, detection, and intercept range. The mounted Prophet configuration also has a directional, stationary Electronic Attack (EA)  subsystem (Block II Key Performance Parameter (KPP)). The mounted Electronic Support (ES) has both a stationary and an OTM operational capability. An OTM jamming (EA) capability is desired.   Prophet is modular and can be tailored to perform special missi ons by the Technology Insertion (TI) of Special Purpose Built Systems (SPBS). These latter enhancements are usually temporary in nature and performed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC), as directed and funded by higher command authority.   The purpose of this Market Survey is to identify sources for production of PROPHET Block II/III. The current supplier of the six Block II/III System Design and Development (SDD) systems is General-Dynamics Decision Systems, Scottsdale, AZ 85252-1417, Cag e Code 1VPW8, with major subcontractors being Raytheon (Falls Church, VA), Rockwell-Collins (Cedar Rapids, IA), QinetiQ (UK) and Astron Wireless Technologies (Chantilly, VA).  Production for Block II/III is not planned to be a build-to-print fabrication of  the SDD item.  A technical design package (level III drawing package) will not be provided to prospective offerors.  Production systems will be required to meet performance-based requirements and do not have to be the same hardware/software solution as th e SDD systems.   Scope of Effort for which Information is Requested.  The Governments initial requirement for Prophet Block II/III calls for the acquisition of three Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Block II/III systems in FY05.  A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated, with delivery of three LRIP units within t hirteen months after contract award, being one at month 12 and then one at month13 and one at month 15. The total all-inclusive cost for these three LRIP systems is not planned or budgeted to exceed $12M. The projected LRIP contract award date is 30 June 2 005. First Article Testing (FAT) on the three LRIP systems must be completed prior to delivery of the first three LRIP units.  The first three LRIP systems will be used for Developmental Test (DT) and Operation Test (OT) that is planned to start on 1 July 2006.    Additionally, the planned contract will include options for an additional thirteen LRIP system s over two years (FY06/07) and approximately sixty-nine Full Rate Production (FRP) systems starting in FY08. The average unit cost per system is forecast for budgeting purposes not exceed $1.5M.   Potential respondents must possess an accredited Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in order to handle future technical insertion upgrades.   Proposed Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for the Block II/III systems consists of the following (note * denotes items which are required to be incorporated into the system):    Nomenclature and NSN / PN; High-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), 2320-01-412-0143; Amtech Shell, 01-106475; MastSystems Mast, 02-106375-01; Titan AN/PRD -13(v)2*, 5825-01-467-0329; KVH Tactical Navigation Device,	Various; AN/VRC-92 Single-Channel Ground Air Radio System (SINCGARS)*, 5820-01-451-8250; AN/PSN-11 Global Positioning System Navigator System (Position Location GPS Receiver - PLGR),	5825-01-374-6643.   Furthermore, the planned contract shall include requirements for complete supportability and logistical tasks such as providing Technical Manuals, maintenance concepts and demonstration, test plans, calibration plans, etc.  Note:  this announcement is on ly a Market Survey and prospective offerors are not required to provide detailed plans for supportability and logistics at this time.   Interested respondents with the appropriate security credentials and holding facilities may be subsequently provided with more detailed classified Prophet requirements.   Requested Response.   Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Suppliers capable of furnishing these units must do so in writing. The response should be a short introductory description (unclassified) of a viable appro ach meeting the above needs, and should address production capacity and surge capability (for up to thirty units in a year).

<DESC>PART: U.S. GOVERNMENT SUBPART: MARKET RESEARCH CLASSCOD: ProductionMARKET SURVEY OFFADD: U.S. Army CECOM, CECOM Acquisition Center, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008 SUBJECT:  Prophet Block II/III Production DUE  19 November 2004 POC Mark Conrad 732 427-1959, Project Leader, SFAE-IEW&S-SG; Contracting Officer Andrew Dellomo (732) 532-3569 AMSEL-AC-CC-RT-G Request For Information.  Product Manager Prophet, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, is seeking sources for production of Prophet Block II/III, the Armys tactical ground Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Electronic Support (ES) & Electronic Attack (EA) system.   System Description: Prophet is the principal ground-based brigade tactical SIGINT/EW (Electronic Warfare) and IEW (Intelligence and EW) sensor system, which provides force protection and intelligence support to the US Army Division, Brigade, Stryker Brigade Unit of Action (SB UA), Armored Cavalry Regiments (ACR), and subordinate commanders. Prophet has three operation modes in the tactical environment that include the dismounted (Man-pack) operational mode, the High Mobility, Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mounted versio n that operates in either Stationary (elevated antenna mast) or On-The-Move (OTM) modes. Prophet searches and monitors the radio frequency spectrum, performs signal collection (intercept), Direction Finding (DF (Line-Of-Bearing (LOB) only)), and stationary  jamming (with a directional jamming antenna) against enemy tactical emitters. Prophet is tasked by and interfaces with Prophet Control (PC), which is located with the supported commands Analysis and Control Team (ACT). Prophet is organic to U.S. Army lig ht and heavy division, and deploys with the combat brigades, SBUAs, and ACRs. Prophet System provides Actionable Intelligence (also called Force Protection information) to the forward deployed tactical commanders. The dismounted Man-pack version is capab le of early entry or airborne insertion, and can quickly be converted to the mounted version after the Prophet HMMWVs have been deployed into the battlespace. The HMMWV mounted Prophet has an automatic antenna mast that elevates the antenna subsystem to a 7-meter height (for Stationary operation only) above ground level (AGL). This higher antenna elevation increases Prophets DF, detection, and intercept range. The mounted Prophet configuration also has a directional, stationary Electronic Attack (EA) subsy stem (Block II Key Performance Parameter (KPP)). The mounted Electronic Support (ES) has both a stationary and an OTM operational capability. An OTM jamming (EA) capability is desired.   Prophet is modular and can be tailored to perform special missions by  the Technology Insertion (TI) of Special Purpose Built Systems (SPBS). These latter enhancements are usually temporary in nature and performed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC), as directed and funded by higher command authority. The purpose of this Market Survey is to identify sources for production of PROPHET Block II/III. The current supplier of the six Block II/III System Design and Development (SDD) systems is General-Dynamics Decision Systems, Scottsdale, AZ 85252-1417, Cage Code 1VPW8, with major subcontractors being Raytheon (Falls Church, VA), Rockwell-Collins (Cedar Rapids, IA), QinetiQ (UK) and Astron Wireless Technologies (Chantilly, VA).  Production for Block II/III is not planned to be a build-to-print fabrication of t he SDD item.  A technical design package (level III drawing package) will not be provided to prospective offerors.  Production systems will be required to meet performance-based requirements and do not have to be the same hardware/software solution as the SDD systems. Scope of Effort for which Information is Requested. The Governments initial requirement for Prophet Block II/III calls for the acquisition of three Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Block II/III systems in FY05.  A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated, with delive ry of three LRIP units within thirteen months after contract award, being one at month 12 and then one at month13 and one at month 15. The total all-inclusive cost for these three LRIP systems is not planned or budgeted to exceed $12M. The projected LRIP c ontract award date is 30 June 2005. First Article Testing (FAT) on the three LRIP systems must be completed prior to delivery of the first three LRIP units.  The first three LRIP systems will be used for Developmental Test (DT) and Operation Test (OT) that  is planned to start on 1 July 2006. Additionally, the planned contract will include options for an additional thirteen LRIP systems over two years (FY06/07) and approximately sixty-nine Full Rate Production (FRP) systems starting in FY08. The average unit cost per system is forecast for budg eting purposes not exceed $1.5M. Potential respondents must possess an accredited Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in order to handle future technical insertion upgrades. Proposed Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for the Block II/III systems consists of the following (note * denotes items which are required to be incorporated into the system):  Nomenclature	NSN / PN High-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)	2320-01-412-0143 Amtech Shell	01-106475 MastSystems Mast	02-106375-01 Titan AN/PRD -13(v)2*	5825-01-467-0329 KVH Tactical Navigation Device	Various AN/VRC-92 Single-Channel Ground Air Radio System (SINCGARS)*	5820-01-451-8250 AN/PSN-11 Global Positioning System Navigator System (Position Location GPS Receiver - PLGR)		5825-01-374-6643 Furthermore, the planned contract shall include requirements for complete supportability and logistical tasks such as providing Technical Manuals, maintenance concepts and demonstration, test plans, calibration plans, etc.  Note:  this announcement is only  a Market Survey and prospective offerors are not required to provide detailed plans for supportability and logistics at this time.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE COMPACT LONG WAVE INFRARED (LWIR) DISPERSIVE IMAGING SPECTROMETER, DS2

Announcement: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Compact LWIR Dispersive Imaging Spectrometer, DS2.

Scientists and Engineers at LLNL have invented the Compact LWIR Imaging Dispersive Spectrometer, DS2 for remotely detecting, identifying and characterizing materials. This technology combines a compact, novel optical design to disperse the light and compensate for optical distortions, a high resolution focal plane array that operates at 45K, and a commercially available Stirling cycle cryocooler to form a compact spectrometer. These features, combined with standard approaches for compacting electronics, enables the use of these spectrometers in applications requiring small size low weight and low power. The spectrometer core is < 18 inches long x < 12 inches wide x < 8 inches tall, weighs < 25 pounds, and consumes < 200 W average power. It provides 256 spectral channels covering the 7.5 – 13.5 micron wavelength region for each of 256 spatial pixels. 

LLNL has completed detail design work, with fabrications and procurement in process for three copies of this first prototype design. Assembly and laboratory characterization is planned for Fall and early Winter followed by field testing for one ground unit and two airborne units. Deliveries are planned in Spring 2005. Potential applications may include environmental monitoring, characterization of mineral types, and homeland security.

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Compact LWIR Dispersive Imaging Spectrometer technology should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology. Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 88-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.

This announcement can also be viewed at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/featuredtechnology.php. Written responses can also be submitted by completing our online Company Contact form.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR PARALLEL AWARE SCALING
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR PARALLEL AWARE SCALING

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's technology for parallel aware scaling.

Operating system interference can dramatically impact the performance of parallel tasks. This technology makes it possible to minimize the effects of operating system interference, thereby improving the performance of a selected parallel job. The technology is most appropriate for systems with large numbers of processors. 

Synchronizing collective operations are required for a large class of parallel algorithms and are quite common. Synchronous collective operations are also a critical component to numerical simulations. 

Synchronous collective operations are operations in which a set of processes (frequently every process) participates and no single process can continue until every process has participated. These operations pose serious challenges to scalability since a single instance of a laggard process will block progress for every process. 

Prior approaches to the problem have concentrated on the co-scheduling aspects, but have not included the comprehensive set of co-scheduling and operating system features that are addressed with LLNL’s invention. 

LLNL’s invention improves the performance of synchronous collective operations by improving the scalability of parallel jobs by adding parallel awareness to the operating system. LLNL’s parallel aware scaling coordinates both an external co-scheduler and the operating system dispatcher in a time-synchronized executing environment in which the tasks of a parallel job are distinguished from other activities and managed to be dispatched simultaneously across the entire distributed system.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's parallel aware scaling technology should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

This training is recommended for both large and small businesses wanting to sell to the Federal government.  If you provide products and services, which you would like to sell to the Federal Government, this session will help you secure work with GSA and other Federal agencies.  It is an excellent way to get your foot in the door of Federal agencies and learn to understand the preferred method of procurement for Department of Defense activities and the civilian agencies.

If your organizations can provide any of the following services to the Federal Government, you should attend the PBS session:

Design and Construction

If your organization provides professional architects, engineers, or you are able to design, renovate, and construct new and existing properties.

GSA has simplified these bills so agencies have a clearer understanding of the costs charged for being housed in federal space.

<SUBJECT>--Pre-Solicitation Conference 12/01/04
<DESC>The Army Field Support Command intends to competitively solicit from the private sector an operating arrangement that will achieve the following objectives: (A.) Reserve, at all times, the nation's ability to produce and/or procure its Warfighters' primary service ammunition, 5.56mm, 7.62mm and .50 Caliber in its primary configurations, ball, traced and blank.  (B.) Obtain the critical provisions to support the military missions.  It is a National imperative to maintain the ability to acquire small caliber ammunition in an environment where projected requirements are expected to increase for the foreseeable futur e.  Increasing military contingencies have created a situation where the capability to produce small caliber ammunition through conventional methods have been fully exercised.  A Second Source Prime Contractor for Small Caliber Ammunition is anticipated to  remedy the current situation by arranging for capability to deliver up to 300 million rounds per year for a five-year period to the U.S. Government.  Quantities could increase up to 500 million per year. The AFSC is seeking sources interested in the Second Source Prime Contractor concept.  To that extent, the Army intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), anticipated in January 2005.  A competitive award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for  establishment of the Second Source Prime Contractor, followed by Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for small caliber ammunition, with the source that provides the best value proposal to the formal RFP is anticipated.     A Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held at the RiverCenter, Davenport, Iowa on 1 December 2004 beginning at 0900 hours.  At that time, industry questions in reference to the draft RFP issued 6 October 2004, will be considered and addressed.  Sources int erested in attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference must contact the Contract Specialist, Ms. Kristin Engelken, with the name of your firm and the number of personnel attending, by 27 October 2004 at AMSFS-CCA-F, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 612 99-6500, (309)782-7345, or kristin.l.engelken@us.army.mil.  Additionally, you are encouraged to submit questions that may be answered at the Pre-Solicitation Conference in reference to the draft RFP issued 6 October 2004,  NLT 1 November 2004 to the point of contact above.  A formal agenda will be sent out to registered participants at a later date.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation, HSCG38-04-Q-101007 incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  The North American Industry Classification System number is 336413. The small business size standard is 1000 employees.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures In Accordance With (IAW) FAR Part 13.5.  The award will be IAW FAR 6.302-1.  

 CLIN 1 – Repair:  4620-14-462-8603, P/N A25400033-4B, (The following part numbers will be recognized as alternate part numbers under this award:  A25400033-4 OR a25400033-ABD) CSD Pump, estimated quantity of 25 each for base period year 1 and 2, 20 each for base period year 3 and 25 each for option period year 1 and 2.  

Interested parties may submit a quotation, which shall include a performance work statement, performance metrics, and incentives/disincentives program, identification of key personnel, quality certifications, past performance, subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9 (or a request for waiver if no subcontracting opportunities will be anticipated), and a firm-fixed-price quote for the following:  

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently  operates twenty  HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  CSD Pumps P/N A25400033-4B, (The following part numbers will be recognized as alternate part numbers under this award:  A25400033-4 OR a25400033-ABD, manufactured by Messier-Hispano-Bugatti, currently installed on these aircraft are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual components historical record of repair or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair or overhaul CSD pumps for return to service, at the best value to the Government.  Repaired or overhauled pumps must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s  (OEM) operational specifications in Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 29-50-10, rev. date 30 June 1992.  ACMS overhaul requirements for this component is 2500 hours.  

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First level repair, a “Return to Service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements in the most economical method (component time continues).  Second level repair “overhaul” would be required for units that have reached their overhaul time limit of 2500 hours, or have a time remaining of 800 hours or less.  A separate cost breakdown for parts listed in ‘Parts Breakout” in the “Description of Supplies or Services” will be required for both levels of service.  At a minimum these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.  

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, CMM, OEM approved replacement parts, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  

To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for Level I and Level II repair of  CSD pump to return to service.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.  Include any incentives or disincentives.

c.	Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System.

d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, calibrated test equipment and fixtures to meet the OEM specifications.


2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair or overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed pricing schedule that shall include hourly labor rate and parts for repair or overhaul IAW CMM  29-50-10, revision date June 30, 1992,  and for “Breakout Parts” listed in “Description of Supplies or Services”.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Level I Repair:  inspection, repair and replacement of parts as necessary to return the unit to service in the best value to the Government method, which  does not zero out component time.
   
b.	Level II Repair:  considered as over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation or have reached their service life of 1700 hours or greater since last overhaul.  A Level II Repair zeros the components’ time since overhaul .

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The assessment shall include an analysis of the roles of the private sector as users of IOOS products and services.

The role of the private sector in the governance of IOOS shall also be assessed.   Deliverables are as follows: (1) Conduct and deliver a study addressing and assessing means and methods to maximize private sector involvement in the development of a sustained IOOS; (2) Final report (Electronic file in MS Word format) and six (6) bound copies of the report, along with any supporting documentation such as appendices and information gathering in completing the study. NOAA shall retain all rights, copyrights and otherwise, to all Intellectual Property developed as a result of this study. The Period of Performance is November 1, 2004 through January 31, 2005.

Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Approach – The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements; 2) Past Performance – The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price – The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (II) Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-9012 is being issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  (III) This solicitation incorporates clauses and provisions in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24. (IV) This requirement is being synopsized as full and open competition under standard industrial classification code 99, NAICS Code 339999.  The resulting contract will be a Firm Fixed Price type Contract under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  (V) COMMERCIAL ITEM DESCRIPTION: Contractor shall provide a complete and usable end product. Contractor must provide pricing on all items FOB destination for their quotes to be accepted. No alterations, additions, or deletions shall be made unless by prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. All work must meet or exceed acceptable industry standards and codes for the building trades. Items will be listed by line item number, **LINE ITEM 0001** 1313 SETS, Load bearing vest, US style Alice field gear, LC-2 Mil-I-43822 plus the following pouches:  2 AK47 magazine pouches, compass pouch, 4 multi-purpose pouches   (VII) Place of delivery / performance:  Tadji Air Base - Airfreight is not required.  Sea shipment is acceptable.   “Shipping shall be included in the unit cost”.   All Cost included, Firm-Fixed Price. All duties and tax are the responsibility of the Contractor.  

PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
The following is information will be provided upon award to assist with the completion of the cargo plaque

Primary Contract Number #:  	 W914NS-05-X-XXXX

E-mail:  IsgriggJ@mnstci.iraq.centcom.mil 

Requiring Activity:  CMATT 

Delivery Info:    




Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.


It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (II) Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-9007 is being issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  (III) This solicitation incorporates clauses and provisions in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24. (IV) This requirement is being synopsized as full and open competition under standard industrial classification code 5012, NAICS Code 423110.  The resulting contract will be a Firm Fixed Price type Contract under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  (V) COMMERCIAL ITEM DESCRIPTION: Contractor shall provide a complete and usable end product. Contractor must provide pricing on all items FOB destination for their quotes to be accepted. No alterations, additions, or deletions shall be made unless by prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

(VII) Place of delivery / performance:  Tadji Iraq-38SMC3190208695   Airfreight is not required.  Sea shipment is acceptable.   “Shipping shall be included in the unit cost”.   All Cost included, Firm-Fixed Price. All duties and tax are the responsibility of the Contractor.  

PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
The following is information will be provided upon award to assist with the completion of the cargo plaque
