<DESC>Description of requirement:
<p>Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) DNA sequencing instrument.</p>
<p>Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies ("next generation" sequencing or NGS technologies)</p>
<p>System capabilities:</p>
<p>Capable of detecting the incorporation of bases in real time as the enzyme synthesizes the complementary strand, using the unamplified DNA from the source organism or clone as template. Capable of allowing the enzyme to function in the absence of data collection for defined periods of time, allowing stretches of sequence to be observed along a very long template molecule(called "strobe" sequencing) to provide linking between sequences bordering repetitive elements that disrupt genome assembly when performed using only short read shotgun sequencing. A system that does not require an amplification step thereby removing one source of error from the DNA sequence, to provide the opportunity to derive longer range haplotypes linking DNA sequence variation along individual chromosomes of diploid or multiploid organisms. Capable of massive parallel observation of natural DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase as it occurs. The instrument exclusively processes SMRT Cells and reagents, creating a scaled platform for sequencing with single molecule resolution.</p>
