<DESC>The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) provides reading materials in audio and braille formats to U.S. residents and to U.S. citizens living abroad who are unable to use conventional print materials because of visual or physical limitations. Reading materials (books and magazines) are produced by contractors for NLS and are distributed to more than 700,000 patrons through a network of approximately 115 regional and sub regional libraries. In addition, NLS provides patrons with cassette and digital players needed to play back the materials produced in audio formats. NLS is completing the transition from analog to digital technology. Regional libraries are in the midst of replacing the analog players with the new digital players. It is expected that the analog players will be replaced by digital players by the end of fiscal 2011. <br /><br />In recent years, NLS has produced annually over 2000 titles in cassette books, approximately 600 titles in braille books, about 37 print/braille books, 30 braille magazines and 40 magazines on cassette. There are over 700,000 analog audio playback machines in the inventory. There are 430,000 digital machines that have been manufactured. 190,000 have been distributed and 240,000 are in libraries awaiting distribution. <br /><br />Network libraries are state or local organizations responsible for local library services to the blind. It should be noted that the 115 regional and sub regional libraries are referred to, commonly and throughout this document, as "the network" and the individual libraries as "network libraries". The network is cooperative, not electronic. Each network library is responsible for the distribution of all NLS reading materials and machines in its region. Network libraries range from very small with one staff person and a few hundred patrons, to very large with over fifty staff persons and over ten thousand patrons. Circulation may range from a few dozen books a day to several thousand a day. Each library registers and serves eligible patrons in its geographic area. In states with subregional libraries, responsibilities for library activities may be divided in various ways between the regional library and the subregional libraries. All network libraries follow NLS guidelines and procedures as described in a network library manual and associated bulletins from NLS. However, they remain state government entities organizationally independent of NLS. <br /><br />The procedures performed by a network library are more complex than those in a library for sighted persons. Patrons normally do not come into the library to select or pick up books or magazines. Almost all circulation is performed by mail. Libraries are responsible for processing this circulation activity and for maintaining patron information. Most network libraries are also machine lending agencies, which are responsible for distribution, monitoring, and repair of the playback machines used by patrons for recorded materials. Playback machines are U.S. government property and must be duly accounted for. <br /><br />Book Selection: Patrons receive book service in one of several ways. They receive periodic catalogs and bibliographies by mail from NLS contractors. The publications contain order forms for both books and magazines which can be mailed by the patron to the network library. The library records these requests, which may cumulate to several hundred. A patron may also request the library to automatically select books based on specific subjects or authors. When this procedure is used, the library records the books already sent to the patron so that titles will not be sent to the reader multiple times. In addition, information is kept about the reader's playback equipment, and reader preferences related to subject interests, level of reading comprehension, sex of the narrators, and willingness to accept books with strong language, violence or explicit descriptions of sex. <br /><br />Circulation: A library may send books to a patron either when they return books, at a predetermined rate weekly or monthly, or only on patron request. The timing and number of books sent may be changed for any patron as needed. Normally, on a daily basis, a library determines which patrons are due for service and selects books from the current inventory based on request lists or subject categories. Mail cards are produced and the books are mailed to the patrons. Books are also returned by mail and checked back into the inventory. <br /><br />Patron Information: In addition to circulation related information, the library must maintain the patron's correct mailing address to send materials and other information and maintain statistics requested by NLS. <br /><br />Magazine Information: Magazines produced by NLS are sent directly to patrons from NLS contractors. Libraries are responsible for sending information about patron subscriptions and addresses to a designated NLS mailing list contractor so that the patrons receive requested magazines. In addition, a library may circulate locally produced magazines in a manner similar to books. <br /><br />Machine Information: Libraries which are machine lending agencies must keep records of the playback machines received for distribution and track the location or disposition of each machine as being available for assignment, assigned to a specific patron, in repair, lost, or damaged beyond repair. <br /><br />NLS Reporting: As part of the national network, libraries must report readership and circulation statistics and other information back to NLS. They must also account for their assigned machines, which are government owned equipment. <br /><br />Key to the circulation process is the reader advisor, a member of the staff of the network library who speaks with the patron and advises on all issues related to the service. The reader advisor requires immediate access to information on the availability of titles, the status of requests, waiting lists, patron preferences, etc. Reader advisors and other staff of the library may require assistive devices, especially for the blind, for system operation. <br /><br />C.1.2 Background of READS <br /><br />Most of the network libraries support their operations with automated systems. In 1983, approximately twenty used a variety of mainframe and minicomputer systems and software. At that time, NLS recognized the need to make the benefits of automation available to a wider range of libraries. NLS contracted for the development of a circulation system for libraries for the blind with a small to medium volume which could not otherwise afford a system of their own. The system concept was based on the use of microcomputers, with the option of a stand alone workstation for the smallest libraries or a configuration of multiple workstations in a local area network (LAN) for larger libraries. <br /><br />Between 1983 and 1985, the Reader Enrollment and Delivery System (READS) was developed and testing was performed in 1986. In 1987, READS was released for production. Over the years, it has been enhanced and rewritten. It is now in use by over 35 network libraries and several outside organizations serving the blind. The software is the property of the Library of Congress. <br /><br />Each READS library is responsible for acquisition and maintenance of the computer hardware, peripheral equipment and supplies needed for the system. A READS library is also responsible for obtaining support from the READS contractor for services specific to that library and not applicable to the READS community as a whole. In practice, those library specific services are almost exclusively limited to installation support. NLS, through the READS contractor, provides installation preparation, telephone support, software and hardware debugging, maintenance, and system enhancements (currently suspended). <br /><br />Though most libraries are now automated, it is possible that a few more libraries will want to use READS over time. In addition, NLS makes READS available to other organizations which serve the blind and physically handicapped. To ensure that READS continues to be a useful product for NLS and its libraries, NLS intends to continue maintenance of the software. Software enhancements are currently suspended. The contractor will assist NLS in providing this support as described in the Scope of Work. <br /><br />READS operates under Windows 95 through Windows 7 with MS SQL Server. In 1997, NLS made its book title data available over the Internet in a MARC format. READS accepts that data as input to its book title database. It is also designed to directly mail magazine subscription data, machine reports and other NLS operations information to NLS or its contractors over the Internet. <br /><br />Included in the overall READS support requirement is a small, separate program called "Print/Braille Labels." The program is designed to accept input to print labels for cassette books using a laser printer for an eye readable label and a specialized printer from Blazie Engineering, Inc., for clear acetate overlay labels in braille. The program operates under the READS software platform. <br /><br />READS is used in libraries for the blind that often have blind staff members. READS, as a Windows system, requires special attention in its development to ensure that its design is carried out in such a way as to be compatible with screen readers which provide output to speech and Braille devices. NLS has developed a new digital format and digital player for audio books. The new digital technology required significant changes to READS. <br /><br />C.2 SCOPE OF WORK <br /><br />The required contractor services include the following functions: <br /><br />1. Customer Support of READS Users and Potential Users <br /><br />2. Maintenance of the Software <br /><br />3. Enhancements to the Software <br /><br />4. Pre Installation, Installation and Training for READS libraries <br /><br />5. Administrative Coordination of Support Activities (e.g., preparation and distribution of materials) <br /><br /><br />Each of these services is described in more detail below. For the purposes of this RFP, "an NLS agency" is an organization eligible to be a user of the READS software. This is defined to be one of the NLS network libraries, NLS approved machine lending agencies in the NLS network, or an NLS approved agency serving the blind and physically handicapped which cooperates with NLS in other ways. A machine lending agency is an organization which handles the distribution of NLS equipment used to play talking books. Most NLS libraries are also machine lending agencies, but there are a few stand alone machine lending agencies that work with NLS. <br /><br />The contractor shall be required to assist NLS in the investigation, testing, and implementation of system improvements and proposed enhancements. The contractor must be familiar with NLS activities and goals and be able to understand complex relationships between NLS activities and agencies. The contractor will be required to provide customized services to agencies based on differences in size, automation expertise, and organizational position and staffing. <br /><br />The contractor shall provide ongoing customer support to READS users through the telephone hotline and other communications services. The contractor shall also provide ongoing maintenance to the system, obtaining prior approval of the COTR/ contracting officer for maintenance actions or maintenance levels of work that are out of the ordinary. For enhancements, the contractor will be assigned specific tasks by the NLS Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The contractor shall be responsible for estimating level of effort and duration for each task for review and obtaining approval of the COTR/contracting officer prior to the start of each task. The contractor shall be required to maintain a list of currently assigned tasks, and shall submit a monthly report to the COTR with detail concerning the status of each task, outlining deliverables provided and work performed. <br />

In addition GSA will provide specific information that is peculiar to GSA controlled facilities, i.e., regulations, codes, requirements, executive orders, etc. Changes may be made as a result student evaluations. Yearly, GSA will review the course curriculum for relevancy and updated content and contractor will incorporate the government's comments.</p>
<p>Add Alternates:</p>
<p>"Alternates" are alternate services, materials, equipment, system methods, units of work or major elements which may, at the government options and under the terms established by the contract, be selected for the work in lieu of the corresponding requirement of the contract documents. Selection may occur prior to the award or be deferred for possible selection at a later date.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Deliverables: <br /></strong></span>Contractor shall offer training as order by the government, October 1st through September 30th of each year, with one week in between. In months where it is possible to do more than two, they may be scheduled at the discretion of the contractor; however, no less than 24 classes per fiscal year will be offered. The type session and schedule will ultimately be approved by GSA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance Measures: </span></strong></p>
<p>Throughout the life of the contract, the Contractor will be evaluated on the performance measures below to ensure that the required services in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) are met. (See Attachment B)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall strive to meet all the requirements of the contract, 100% of the time. However, in order to continue to provide services to the Government under the contract, a performance threshold of 95% has been established. The contractor's performance shall be evaluated by the designated COR. All non-conforming services shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the COR within a reasonable timeframe. If the contractor fails to meet the performance standards after correction of the non-conforming standards, the Government has the right to deduct 5% from the contractor's invoice and elect to cancel the contract at the end of the 12 month performance period due to non-conformance.</p>
<p>Failure to meet the above performance measures may cause a 5% penalty on the invoice if services are not provided in accordance with the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quality Assurance:<br /></strong></span>The contractor shall meet the performance measures at an acceptable quality level to continue services under the contract. The contractor's performance shall be evaluated by the designated COR. All non-conforming services shall be corrected within two business days. If the contractor fails to meet the performance standards after correction of the non-conforming services, the Government has the right to deduct 5% from the contractor's invoice due to non-conformance.</p>
<p>Throughout the life of the contract, the Contractor will be evaluated on the performance measures below to ensure that the required services in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) are met. The performance measures are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A. Methods of Surveillance:</strong></span></p>
<p>Even though the government through its COR will be monitoring the contractors performance on continuous basis, the sheer volume of training and various training sites will make 100% inspection impractical. The government will use the three (3) methodologies:</p>
<p>1. Random observation of classes <br />2. Individual evaluations of the training <br />3. Quarterly evaluations of course materials</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Random Observation</span> - One to Three times per year the COR or designee will observe an actual class and assess the Contractor's facilitator/trainer on the following:</p>
<p>a. Presentation skills,<br />b. Knowledge of Course Material,<br />c. Knowledge of organization/management theory on which course content is based; and<br />d. Ability to communicate training content effectively.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Individual Course Evaluation</span> - The consolidated course evaluation report (provided by contractor) will be evaluated for every class. The evaluations are of each of the key systems presented and the instructor who presented it. The scores range from Poor to Excellent (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, and Excellent).</p>
<p>a.90% of the overall ratings shall be in the Good to Excellent range; and</p>
<p>b.Any evaluations where over 10% of the ratings are in the poor or fair category will be flagged for further evaluation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quarterly Evaluations</span> - Flagged class evaluations will be reviewed for low scores in the following categories:<br />a.Instructor;<br />b.Course Content;<br />c.Training Materials; and <br />d.Classroom Experience/Setup</p>
<p>If performance of any required service is unsatisfactory and that performance is the result of actions (or lack of action) by the Contractor, the CO may take action in accordance with the FAR clause 52.246-4, "Inspection of Services."</p>
<p>The best means of determining whether the Contractor has met all Contract requirements is to inspect the results. Such inspections confirm that value is received for the money spent or that problems exist. Documented surveillance results are the most effective tool used to enforce Contract administration actions.</p>
<p>A Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) will be initiated by the COR if, at any time during the performance period specified in the PWS or Task Order, the results of GSA's monitoring indicate that the contractor's performance is unacceptable (i.e. did not conform to the requirements, and the COR determines that the unacceptable performance was not caused by the Government. (See Attachment C).</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B.Quality Assurance Evaluations &amp; Reporting<br /></span></strong>The COR or designee will utilize appropriate quality assurance monitoring forms to document and evaluate the contractor's performance under this contract. The forms will document the COR's understanding of what the contractor was supposed to do, what was actually done, and the impact or consequences what was done.</p>
<p>The COR or designee will evaluate each training event in accordance with the performance standard and performance requirements in the SOW.</p>
<p>The COR or designee must substantiate all fair or poor designations of their performance. Performance in the excellent, very good and good are expected from the contractor and need not be substantiated. However, comments with high praise will be shared with the contractor and posted on the website as an advertisement to encourage participation by the COR or designee.</p>
<p>The COR or designee shall forward copies of all completed QA monitoring forms to the CO and contractor by email. Contractor will respond to any negative comments or recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C. Analysis of Surveillance Results<br /></strong></span>The CO shall review each quarterly report and when appropriate investigate negative findings to determine if all the facts and circumstances surrounding the event were considered in the COR's opinions outlined on the forms. The CO will immediately discuss every event receiving a substandard rating with the contractor to assure that corrective action is promptly initiated. <br />At the end of each quarter the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall result of the surveillance o the contractor's performance during the previous quarter. This report shall become part of the formal QA documents.</p>
<p><strong>Security Requirements: </strong></p>
<p>Contractor will at times be required to work in and have access to GSA-owned buildings. When on GSA-owned property the contractor shall be under the direct supervision of a PM staff member or approved federal person and will not require a HSPD-12 security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Government-Furnished Equipment/Property:</strong></p>
<p>a.Government will provide facilities for the classroom training and for the tour. In most cases the tour will be conducted in the same building (preferable) but will be coordinated with the Regions' Points of Contact.</p>
<p>b.Government will provide updated GSA-specific information on an as needed, but no less than annually for incorporation into the training material. GSA may add and will require the contractor to add course material as deemed necessary by GSA COR or designee.</p>
<p>c.Government will provide input derived from course evaluations</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractor Furnished Information/Equipment and/or Property:<br /></strong></span>With the exception of the Government furnished Facilities/Information stated in the preceding paragraph the Contractor must provide all manpower, transportation, computers, and other items necessary for the performance of this requirement; including but not limited to:<br />a. Text Books<br />b. Work Books<br />c. Discs of Presentation<br />d. Recorded Production of Class and/or webinar, as necessary.</p>
<p>A sufficient amount of text books will be prepared and maintained for the students use for each class. Contractor will develop some type of issuance system wherein the student understands the text book is for their use only during the class and that they must be turned in on the last day. Each student will be provided with a disc of the training content along with their certification of completion after attending the 3 full days of training.</p>
<p>The contractor must determine the appropriate amount of Continuing Education Units (CEU) for each course and award same to students upon completion of the three full days of training.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide a sign in sheet indicating participation on each day with pre-determined gathering of the following information from participants:<br />a. Number of years with GSA<br />b. Number of years in current position <br />c. Position Title<br />d. Name of Organization<br />e. Whether or not this training was part of a formal training plan or voluntary</p>
<p>The contractor will provide, for each class, electronic copies of the following documentation:<br />a. Sign-In Sheets <br />b. Class Picture <br />c. Individual Evaluation Forms <br />d. Summary of Evaluations<br />e. And a copy of Invoice</p>
<p>The courses developed by the contractor will become the property of the US Government and the contractor will provide GSA with complete copies of the presentation material including slides, films, and speakers notes. <br />Due to unforeseen travel restrictions we may need to present this training with alternate mediums in case travel to training sites is not funded. One method would be to record the training and another method would be to produce a "Webinar" of the training to provide the training using the internet, where the contractor would present the training with the students being virtual with the ability to participate with their computers. The contractor will provide a separate line item price for these two methods in their proposal.</p>

<DESC>THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE IS AMENDED AS FOLLOWS: <br /><br />DUE DATE FOR QUOTES IS EXTENDED TO JULY 29, 2011, 12 PM EASTERN TIME. <br /><br /><br />AMENDMENT FOUR: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND SPECIFICATON CHANGES.
<p>QUESTION 1:</p>
<p>The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), defined as follows, should be better than 10000:1 for an average of 10 consecutive runs. The instrument with the highest signal to noise ratio in the conditions described below will be preferred.<br />To ensure fair comparison, vendor MUST provide data and documentation of the testing procedure supporting this specification in the following exact conditions:<br />&bull; Scan time: 5 seconds for the background spectrum and 5 s for the sample spectrum.<br />&bull; Spectra must be recorded at 4 cm-1 of spectral resolution.<br />&bull; The SNR must be measured as the peak-to-peak noise in the 2,000-2,200 cm-1 spectral region using Norton-Beer Medium Apodization, Mertz phase correction for an average of 10 consecutive runs. <br />Most scientists utilize ASTM E-1421 method for FT-IR spectrometers testing, which tests a variety of important actual functional parameters that are important in research utilization of a FT-IR spectrometer. No one collects spectra in this manner in 5 seconds, and certainly no one interested in high sensitivity performance. The only way to do this is to manipulate the raw data using a smoothing algorithm, which is really not showing true instrument performance. These specifications should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>ANSWER 1:</p>
<p><br />NIST is interested in high sensitivity performance. During market research it was determined that the signal to noise ratio could be measured in the above specified conditions. The suggested ASTM E-1421 method is not intended for comparing different FTIR instruments but rather to quantify the performance of a given FTIR spectrometer with time. In this method there is no indication to run the background and sample spectra for 1 minute. In the ASTM E-1421 it is suggested to run the experiments for 30 seconds. With this in mind we added specification number 6 in the FTIR spectrometer minimum specifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION 2:</p>
<p>23. The vendor shall supply experimental evidence of the best lateral resolution achievable for chemical mapping for a wavelength in the 2800-3000 cm-1 range. Such chemical mapping should be carried out in the best available conditions in transmission or reflection configuration (NOT with an ATR objective, NOT with a grazing angle objective) using a MCT point detector, globar IR source and KBr beam splitter. Stronger consideration will be given to the instrument with the best lateral resolution (3 - 4 &micro;m or smaller is preferred) in the conditions indicated above</p>
<p>ANSWER 2:</p>
<p><br />NIST is interested in acquiring a system able of performing chemical mapping with high lateral spatial resolution in the 2800 to 3000 cm-1 region for research purposes because some of the materials under investigation present characteristic spectral differences in the spectral region. While the fingerprint region is also generally important it is not particularly relevant to the research conducted in the laboratory at NIST because the containments given by the diffraction limit are such that only bigger objects (which are not of scientific interest to this laboratory) can be resolved in this region for IR chemical imaging. The aim of the instrumentation at NIST is to perform IR chemical imaging on the smallest possible particle or object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 3:</p>
<p>We are requesting that you add the</p>
<p>contract clause FAR 52.219-4 and 52.219-23, the HUBZone and Small</p>
<p>Disadvantaged Business Price Evaluation Preference to your full and open</p>
<p>competitive solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWER 3:<br />Clause 52.219-4 will be added to the solicitation. Clause 52.219-23 does not apply explained below:</p>
<p>(1) Civilian agencies no longer have the authorization to use SDB Price Evaluation Preference. FAR 19.11 only applies to DOD, NASA, and Coast Guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REVISED SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>Specifications for Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and IR microscope.</p>
<p>Add Background:</p>
<p>NIST is interested in acquiring a FTIR spectrometer and IR microscope which will be used for very sensitive and difficult measurements and require the highest level of sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. The aim of the IR microscope is to perform IR chemical imaging on the smallest possible particle or object in the 3000 cm-1 spectral range.</p>
<p>Minimum specifications:</p>
<p>FTIR spectrometer (RE-NUMBERED 1-16)<br /><br />1. Research grade instrumentation with the highest sensitivity and spectral resolution required to conduct advanced infrared nanomaterials characterization.<br />2. The FTIR spectrometer should be able to record infrared (IR) spectra in the region the 7800-375 cm-1 spectral range with only one set of optics, one IR source and one IR detector. <br />3. The FTIR spectrometer must allow recording step scan experiments. <br />4. Spectral resolution better than 0.125 cm-1 apodized or better than 0.1 cm-1 unpodized (optical).<br />5. The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), defined as follows, shall be better than 10000:1 for an average of 10 consecutive runs. <br />To ensure fair comparison, vendor MUST provide data and documentation of the testing procedure supporting this specification in the following exact conditions:<br />&bull; Scan time: 5 seconds for the background spectrum and 5 s for the sample spectrum.<br />&bull; Spectra must be recorded at 4 cm-1 of spectral resolution.<br />&bull; The SNR must be measured as the peak-to-peak noise in the 2,000-2,200 cm-1 spectral region using Norton-Beer Medium Apodization, Mertz phase correction for an average of 10 consecutive runs. <br />&bull; The spectrum must be recorded with a Globar source, with a KBr beamsplitter and with a room temperature deuterated lanthanum triglycine sulfate (DLaTGS) detector.</p>
<p>Stronger consideration will be given to the instrument with the highest signal to noise ratio in the conditions described above and it will be preferred.</p>
<p>Add specification six as follows:</p>
<p>6. Additionally, the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) shall be provided in the following exact experimental conditions for an average of 10 consecutive runs. The vendor shall provide data and documentation of the testing procedure supporting this specification:<br />&bull; Scan time: 30 seconds for the background spectrum and 30 s for the sample spectrum.<br />&bull; Spectra must be recorded at 1 cm-1 of spectral resolution.<br />&bull; The SNR must be measured as the peak-to-peak noise in the 2,000-2,200 cm-1 spectral region using Norton-Beer Medium Apodization, Mertz phase correction for an average of 10 consecutive runs. <br />&bull; The spectrum must be recorded with a Globar source, with a KBr beamsplitter and with a room temperature deuterated lanthanum triglycine sulfate (DLaTGS) detector.</p>
<p>The SNR should be better than 10000:1 in the conditions described above.</p>
<p>Stronger consideration will be given to the instrument with the highest signal to noise ratio and it will be preferred. (Stronger consideration is added under quotation evaluation below)</p>
<p>7. The instrument must be equipped with 2 detectors: <br />&bull; A DLaTGS operating in the 12,000-250 cm-1 spectral range with sensitivity (D*) equal or better than 4 x 108 cm&#8729;Hz1/2&#8729;W-1.<br />&bull; A Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) detector operating in the 11700-600 cm-1 spectral range and D* &gt; 2 x 1010 cm&#8729;Hz1/2&#8729;W-1.<br />8. The instrument shall be equipped with a Germanium on KBr beam splitter operating in the 7800-370 cm-1 spectral range.<br />9. The instrument must allow to experiments with external sources of infrared radiation such as tunable IR lasers. In particular the instrument should allow using the external IR source in place of the traditional globar IR light source. <br />10. The instrument should be purged with dry air or nitrogen.<br />11. Computer (PC)-controlled with software included.<br />12. Device shall include at least 1 year warranty, installation and training.<br />13. Optional warranty for the following years.<br />14. The FTIR spectrometer must be commercially available and NOT a prototype.<br />15. The FTIR instrument must be new, NOT used or refurbished.<br />16. The FTIR instrument should have the option of rapid scan acquisition to record at least 110 spectra per second with a spectral resolution of 16 cm-1 and scanning speed range up to 320 kHz. The rapid scan device, electronics and dedicated software (if any) should be quoted apart and listed as optional.</p>
<p><br />IR Microscope (RE-NUMBERED 17-29)</p>
<p>17. The IR microscope should be provided as an accessory of the FTIR spectrometer described above. In particular, the IR microscope should rely on the IR source, beam splitter and interferometer of the FTIR spectrometer while one (or two) dedicated microscope detectors should be used for recording the micro-IR spectra.<br />18. The IR microscope should enable the collection of the optical overview image of the sample, the selection of a user defined measurement area and the subsequent micro-IR spectra acquisition.<br />19. The microscope should have a motorized stage to enable the acquisition of point by point IR spectra thus enabling IR-chemical mapping and the creation of chemical (IR) maps. <br />20. The microscope stage should move with 0.1 &micro;m steps or smaller and have an accuracy of 0.1 &micro;m or better.<br />21. The IR microscope should be equipped with a dedicated MCT detector operating in the 11700-850 cm-1 spectral range or larger and D* &gt; 4 x 1010 cm&#8729;Hz1/2&#8729;W-1.</p>
<p><br />22. The microscope should be equipped with 15x IR transmission and reflection objective or similar.</p>
<p>Delete Specification 22 (Old Number 22):<br /><br />The microscope should be equipped with an IR objective able to reduce the pixel size to half the wavelength of light at 3000 cm-1 for transmission and reflection experiments. In other words, the pixel resolution should be better than 1.5 &micro;m to achieve 3 &micro;m of lateral resolution in transmission and reflection at 3000 cm-1.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to award a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JFOC) for the End Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS) to the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center (UM-KECC). <br /><br /><br />The successful completion of the contract being implemented under CMS's final rule from August 12, 2010 will require a contractor to have direct experience with the ESRD PPS system. The skills necessary to furnish the deliverables required under this contract include quantitative analysis, research, econometric modeling, and knowledge of the statistical techniques, ability to perform simulations of impact and the ability to manipulate large ESRD related data bases for the creation of analytical files.<br /><br /><br />UM-KECC is the only contractor available with the direct experience leading to the successful completion of the tasks identified under the CMS's final rule from August 12, 2010. They've previously identified areas of research, monitoring, modifications and refinements for the payment system.<br /><br />CMS anticipates selecting severable tasks from the subject universe identified within the final rule taking into consideration the agency's exigencies, changing requirements, stakeholder input and potential changes in legislation. UM-KECC can provided the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, support and/or supplies to accomplish the tasks identified.<br /><br />The justification (award) is based upon the authority of 41 U.S.C &amp; 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.
