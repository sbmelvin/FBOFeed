<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a 12 month simplified acquisition (not greater than $100,000) with the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (AATOD).  No solicitation package is available for this requirement.  AATOD will develop a web-based, online, interactive training course for Opioid Treatment Staff on Hepatitis C.  Online content will be based on current scientific knowledge of Hepatitis C infection and effective opioid treatment principles.  The goal of training is to decrease the rate of infection in methadone or levo-alpha-acethyl-methanol (LAAM) medicated patients, stop or decrease the rate of progression of the infection, and increase referrals of already infected patients to appropriate medical services.  The interactive online training course will provide information to trainees on the latest epidemiological data; means of transmission; symptoms of the infection; high-risk behaviors; diagnosis and treatment; ways to avoid infection and reinfection; how to decrease the progression of the disease; how to identify and avoid other liver toxins; and, when and where to look for treatment.  The training course shall meet qualifications for Continuous Medical Education (CME) and Continuous Education Unit (CEU) credits.  AATOD will maintain, update and promote the website.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The AATOD is uniquely qualified for the following reasons: AATOD?s mission is to work for positive change in the field of opioid agonist treatment, improve the quality of healthcare facilities, increase the legitimacy of the treatment system, and reduce stigmas associated with the field.  It exists as a trade association representing the opioid agonist treatment field.  It maintains very close contacts with the Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP) in the United States and is the largest of the OTP organizations, representing OTP organizations in 18 states and the District of Columbia.  AATOD has worked extensively with federal and state agencies to assist its members in improving the field of methadone treatment.  It is familiar with the new opioid treatment regulations SAMHSA must follow in accordance with 42 CFR Part 8.  AATOD has provided training to OTP staff on a variety of cogent topics, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C prevention and treatment.  It has established relationships and built trust with members of the opioid agonist treatment field, representatives and leaders in the medical field, and with Hepatitis B and C prevention and training organizations.  It has successfully developed medically focused educational offerings and projects.  AATOD has the management capability and expertise in place to create an interactive online training course, designed for OTP staff, on Hepatitis C.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Government?s requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements of the purchase order.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to AATOD.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation package is available for this requirement, therefore requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  The NAICS code is 611430.  SeeNumbered Note 22.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  THE TECHNOLOGY:  The Glow Discharge Plasma Reactor is an aggressive water treatment for organics destruction and disinfection of biological contaminants.  Experimental results show good efficacy for the destruction of the recalcitrant organics, 1,1 dichloroethane (DCA) and chloroform.  Ninety percent destruction of 100-200 ppm DCA and chloroform require approximately 12-15 kWh of electrical power per 1000 gals, respectively, when the reactor is operated @ 150 mm Hg absolute pressure.  Experiments on the continuous flow reactor indicate that approximately the same utilization of current is accomplished at 50 mm Hg as at 150 mm Hg but requires only 60% of the power because the voltage is lower.  Based upon this result, it is estimated that the batch reactor would achieve a 90% destruction for DCA and chloroform  requiring only 7-10 kWh/1000 gals, respectively.  Experiments on the continuous falling film reactor indicate that mass transfer to the liquid surface dominates the destruction rate and the energy utilization.  This is also consistent with a parallel reaction model in which active species are lost to recombination when the generation rate (proportional to current) rises above the mass transfer rate to bring contaminants to the surface.  The active species generated in the Glow Discharge Plasma Reactor have also been shown to be effective for the destruction of Cryptosporidia and Giardia oocysts and cysts.

<SOLNBR>292-02-P(HA)-0340-Solicitation
<CONTACT>Kenneth Roman, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-4332, Fax 301-402-1103, Email romank@ors.od.nih.gov
<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE - NIH SEEKS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER
 	The National Institutes of Health ("NIH") is soliciting full and open competition for a Development Manager ("DM") for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of its Building 10 Revitalization Program (the "Project").  Building 10 is located on NIH's campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Building 10 and the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (the "ACRF") comprise the majority of NIH's Clinical Center Complex (the "CCC").  This Project will renovate Building 10 and a portion of the ACRF in order to complement and support the adjoining Clinical Research Center (the "CRC"), now nearing completion.  The Project includes major interior renovation, new construction and site utility work.  
	When Building 10 was originally completed in 1952, it contained approximately 1.3 million square feet.  Over the last fifty years, Building 10 has undergone at least ten major additions and now contains almost 3 million square feet of patient care, laboratory, associated support and public areas.  It is a linear building with projecting wings at each end of the building.  The center portion is called the "E & F Wings."  The projecting wings at each end of the building are called  "Distal Wings." East Distal Wings are labeled A, B, C and D.  West Distal Wings are labeled G, H, J and K.  The Ambulatory Care Research Facility (the "ACRF") was the largest addition to Building 10 and was completed in 1980.  Its footprint includes an underground parking facility (over 500,000 square feet), two large below grade levels primarily containing patient diagnostic, treatment, and public areas called the "Pancake," and a thirteen-story tower containing outpatient clinics and laboratories.  When the new CRC is completed, the ACRF will serve as the physical link between the CRC and the remaining portions of Building 10. 
	Due to the size and complexity of the Building 10 Revitalization Program, NIH has developed an Integrated Plan that sets forth a strategy for vacating, rehabilitating and reoccupying Building 10 and the ACRF (collectively, the "Buildings") in phases, to minimize disruption to the CCC.  This strategy divides the Buildings into two categories: Upper Levels and Lower Levels.  The Upper Levels are typically comprised of levels two and above in each Building, as well as all of the K Wing of Building 10.  The Lower Levels are typically comprised of the first level and the two basement levels in the Buildings. The Integrated Plan divides the Building 10 Revitalization Program into four major design and construction phases:  Phase 1: E & F Wings; Phase 2: West Distal Wings; Phase 3: East Distal Wings, and Phase 4: ACRF.  PHASE 3 AND PHASE 4 ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT.  
The Project will commence with an "Initial Planning Phase," during which the DM will strategize with NIH and develop a plan for completing the Project within the Project budget and the Project schedule (the "Project Plan").  NIH intends to award a base contract for the Initial Planning Phase of the Project and to exercise several options to perform the work required to complete Phase 1 and Phase 2.  NIH currently anticipates that Phase 1 work will be performed from 2002 through 2009 and Phase 2 work will be performed from 2007 through 2012. 
Throughout the life of the contract, the DM will be expected to provide full management services for the Project, including, but not limited to: (a)  conducting competitive procurements to award contracts for the planning, design, construction and other services necessary for completion of the Project and administering those contracts; and (b) providing complete project management services throughout the planning, design, construction, and activation phases of the Project, (c) coordinating the work of all contractors, and (d) acting as interface between those contractors and NIH.  NIH intends the DM to select the necessary design consultants, construction contractors, construction managers, design-builders and/or others with NIH's approval after award of this contract.  NIH will fund the contract amounts.   
	Generally, Initial Planning Phase services will consist of preparing the Project Plan for managing and successfully completing Phase 1 and Phase 2 on time and within budget.  Among other things, the DM will be expected to apply its knowledge of the design and construction industry for the benefit of the NIH to determine the project delivery method most suitable for each element of the work.  During the Initial Planning Phase the DM shall establish a site office for itself and NIH and may retain contractors as required to begin implementing the Project Plan. 
 	Generally, Phase 1 of the renovation work is intended to upgrade the E & F Wing space and change its use from patient care and laboratories to modern biomedical research laboratories, laboratory support, offices, conference facilities, supporting interstitial mechanical space.  Phase 1 Upper Levels work includes, among other things, (1) selective demolition, (2) removing any remaining existing hazardous material, (3) increasing the area of the E & F Wings by extending the South facade 10 feet along the combined length of the E & F Wings at each floor, (4) adding three levels of mechanical penthouses at the roof of each wing, and (5) constructing a subgrade mechanical vault exterior to Building 10 at the South side to provide permanent service to the E & F Wings.  Phase 1 Upper Levels work involves renovation of approximately 565,000 square feet.  Phase 1 Lower Levels work consists of various renovation projects in the Building 10 Lower Levels and the ACRF Pancake levels.  These projects include, among other things, construction of (1) the Level B2 loading dock, (2) a new pedestrian axis to be located at Level 1 of Building 10 and connecting to the CRC's North entrance, (3) Lower Level connections from the CRC to Building 10, (4) a 16-20 foot wide super-corridor for service access on the B-2 Level to facilitate movement to and from the B-2 loading dock, (5) a new cafeteria, and (6) a new conference center as well as other public amenities.  Phase 1 Lower Levels projects involve renovation of approximately 225,000 square feet of interior space.  Before the Phase 1 Upper Levels and Phase 1 Lower Levels work can commence, there are several infrastructure enabling projects interior and exterior to Building 10 that must be completed to isolate the Distal Wings.  These projects will separate all utilities serving E & F Wings and re-feed the Distal Wings for independent operation.  The estimated cost of all Phase 1 work is approximately $315 Million in 2002 dollars.
 	Generally, Phase 2 of the renovation work includes (a) renovation of the West Distal Wings G, H and J of Building 10, (b) renovation of Levels 1 and 2 of the East Distal Wing A of Building 10, (c) the removal and replacement of West Distal Wing K of Building 10, and (d) certain Lower Level work.  Phase 2 involves renovation of approximately 438,000 square feet. The estimated cost of the Phase 2 renovation work is approximately $165 Million in 2002 dollars.
The DM must have demonstrated experience in providing full development services for projects of equal size, complexity and type of client with a high degree of customer satisfaction.  In addition, the DM must be experienced in interacting positively with communities consisting of diverse groups, government agencies, support and operational staff.  The evaluation criteria and instructions are as indicated in the solicitation documents.  The NIH anticipates posting the solicitation/Request for Proposal ("RFP") on its website http://ccb.od.nih.gov on or about July 19, 2002 and awarding the contract on or about last week of October 2002.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421830   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Quantum Analytics under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide an analytical system to measure Endocrine Disruptor Compounds (EDCs) in solid and liquid matrices. Classical analytical chemical concentration techniques cannot be used with EDCs. EDC samples frequently contain naturally occurring organic compounds that interfere with Gas Chromatograph / Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) procedures unless removed. The solution to this problem is a GC/MS with large volume injection and integrated  sample cleanup system.   This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates the Quantum Analytics is the only source that can provide a GC/MS system with both a large volume injection and a sample cleanup system. Quantum adds their system, called the "Apex Prosep 800 XT-6,  Programmable Separation Inlet," to an Agilent GC/MS to create the analytical system needed.    However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be  submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 421830. The anticipated award date is 7/24/02. Interested parties should submit a request to Mr. Josh  Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation PR-OH-02-00391.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  THE TECHNOLOGY:  The Exposure-to-Risk Monitor (E2RM) is intended to monitor the exposure of workers exposed to hazardous chemicals by determining the amounts of chemicals in the workers? breath.  E2RM is a system combining a breath inlet device with an ion trap mass spectrometer that is controlled by a personal computer with appropriate software.  For most volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), the experimental detection limit is approximately 10 parts-per-billion (ppb).  Once the concentration of the VOC and its metabolite is known, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) mathematical model is used to relate exposure levels to the amount of internal dose received and thus, the resulting health risk.  The PBPK model describes how a compound gets into the body, where it goes within the body, how it breaks down, and how it exits the body.  The software to run the PBPK model is part of the software loaded in the personal computer, so the analysis can be completed immediately.  While other monitoring systems usually measure exposure to chemicals in air, the E2RM can determine actual dose from ingestion and skin absorption, as well as inhalation.  Because the detection system is a full-scale ion trap mass spectrometer, the system can simultaneously track and identify multiple chemicals in the body.  The E2RM system can also be used to readout personal chemical samplers using a special desorber unit designed to operate with the system.  This method provides nearly immediate readout of the personal samplers as soon as field exposures are completed.  Since the E2RM is field portable, rapid determination of exposure can be accomplished each time a worker leaves a hazardous environment.  The system scans through the entire mass range every 1.5 seconds.  Thus, the system can rapidly analyze the decay in concentration for several VOCs in the breath simultaneously.  Field studies have been conducted using human volunteers with good results.  Many laboratory studies have been conducted with animals to confirm experimental methods with the PBPK model.  Chemical studies include trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, and others.  Please see:  US Pat. No. 5,645,072.  Please see:  Toxicological Sciences, 2000, vol 56, 61.  Please see:  Inhalation Toxicology, 1996, vol 8, 521.  NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  THE TECHNOLOGY:  Conductive Metal Oxide Films for Photovoltaic Cells or Flat Panel Displays.  This is a method for reducing the charge state of a dopant in a metal oxide film that produces a film in which the dopant is reduced while the metal oxide is not.  This relatively simple technique produces a thin film that is both optically transparent and highly conductive.  These properties are highly desirable for use in photovoltaic cells and flat panel displays, where high levels of both transparency and conductivity are needed.  Also, the process allows for the deposition of biologically active substances within the thin film.  By incorporating osteogenic agents, this could possibly be used for the development of bone-fixation devices or methods of delivering drugs and other therapeutic agents.  Please see:  US Patent No. 5,990,416.  NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  THE TECHNOLOGY:  Nano-engineered sorbents, partly organic and partly inorganic, have proven to be exceptionally selective and efficient in removing heavy metals and other contaminants from waste streams.  These sorbents are self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports?SAMMS--and form effective sorbents for a wide variety of species including mercury, heavy metals, radionuclides and anions.  Silica ceramics containing ordered arrays of cylindrical pores are first prepared.  The pore diameter can be adjusted from 2 to 20 nm, with 5 to 6 nm being the typical diameter used in the sorbents.  The inside surfaces of the channel-like pores are then coated with an organic monolayer whose molecules are covalently bonded to the silica.  The free ends of the tethered molecules can be chemically tailored to sequester particular species from solution.  The exceptionally high surface area of the mesoporous silica support--typically between 900 and 1,000 square meters per gram--gives the SAMMS a very high binding capacity, with the open-pore structure allowing solution species easy access to the pore surfaces, leading to their rapid sorption.  The SAMMS material is readily tailored to absorb the species of interest.  Please visit the SAMMS website at:  www.pnl.gov/etd/product/samms/index.htm.  NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.

The effort will consist of supply support requests including the induction, evaluation, overhaul, repair, manufacture, acquisition and, test of the AOMO items.  The term of the resulting contact is planned to be on a one-year base period with up to four one-year options.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-(1)(2)(iii) services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government?s requirements.  Raytheon is the only known responsible source that can provide the required integrated functional capabilities and services.  Interested parties may submit questions relating to this requirement to the NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland.

<SUBJECT>Y--Rehabilitate portions of the existing sanitary sewer system at Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania.
<SOLNBR>DAHA36-02-R-0003
<RESPDATE>082102
<ARCHDATE>09202002
<CONTACT>Robert Spinelli, (717) 861-8485
<DESC>NA This project requires all plant, labor, tools, materials, equipment, transportation and supervision to rehabilitate portions of the existing sanitary sewer system located at Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania, for the Pennsylvania National Guard.  The purpose of the rehabilitation is to reduce the inflow and infiltration into the existing sanitary sewer system.  The basic construction elements associated with this project include:  1) sanitary sewer televising, logging, and reporting; 2) manhole ph otographing, logging, and reporting; 3) sanitary sewer rehabilitation using trenchless methods (e.g., lining, internal point repairs, and rehabilitation); 4) manhole repairs and rehabilitation; 5) external sanitary sewer point repairs; 6) sanitary sewer, m anhole, and service lateral replacement; and 7) sanitary sewer, manhole, and service lateral abandonment.  The Government has undertaken a preliminary television inspection.  This inspection included televising approximately 12,500 feet of 8 inch, 10 inch,  12 inch, and 15 inch diameter gravity sanitary sewers for the purpose of obtaining information on pipe conditions over a representative sample of the entire project area.   The Government and its representative of previous sanitary sewer system inflow and  infiltration evaluations, as well as of the preliminary television investigation have established the scope of the subject project through assessment.  As a result of these investigations, the various sub-drainage basin areas have been prioritized relativ e to the need for rehabilitation.  It is the intent of the Government to clean and televise all remaining priority area sanitary sewers prior to completion of any pipe rehabilitation in these areas.  In general, pipe rehabilitation for each sub-drainage ba sin area will occur upon completion of television inspections within each sub-drainage basin area.   Due to the need for assessment of inspection results, a short lag period between inspection and rehabilitation might be required.  Upon completion of this assessment, the Government*s representative will communicate proposed rehabilitation methods for the given sub-drainage basin area to the Contractor.  It is the intent of the Government to provide an on-site project representative so that rehabilitation te chniques can be assessed and implemented in real-time.  It is also the intent of the Government to allow the Contractor to begin rehabilitation of the sewers that have already been televised during the preliminary investigation immediately after issuance o f the Notice to Proceed.  The rehabilitation process for each sub-drainage basin is as follows:  1) Contractor abandonment of all facilities marked to be abandoned; 2) Contractor cleaning and inspection of individual sub-drainage basin; 3) Government repre sentative determination of sewer and manhole rehabilitation method(s) for individual sub-drainage basin; and 4) Contractor execution of sewer and manhole rehabilitation.  Because the above-described requirement involves three inter-related phases of implem entation  (preliminary inspection of the sewer facilities by the Contractor, consultation between the Contractor and the Government on appropriate rehabilitation techniques, and actual rehabilitation of the sanitary facilities by the Contractor), diligent coordination between the Contractor and the Government is essential.  To minimize construction coordination problems, the Government will require prospective offerors to demonstrate their ability to efficiently and effectively coordinate all project task r equirements.  The anticipated site visit/pre-bid meeting is 31 July 2002.  The estimated performance period for this project is estimated at two hundred-seventy (270) calendar days.  The estimated construction range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  T he solicitation, a Best Value Request for Proposal, will be available to prime contractors only fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this notice.   The proposal due date will be no less than thirty (30) calendar days after the availability of the solicitation.  The projected date for availability of the solicitation is 17 July 2002 with a projected proposal due date of 21 August 2002.  The solicitat ion is unrestricted, all responsible sources are encouraged to reply.  A limited number of solicitations will be available on a first come first serve basis with one set of plans and specifications provided with each solicitation.  The solicitation plans a nd specifications may be reviewed at the United States Property & Fiscal Office, Purchasing and Contracting, Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania 17003-5003.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price/performance based contract to the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to develop a committee report advising the EPA on the consideration of and reliance on data from certain types of studies conducted with human subjects. The anticipated contract will have an estimated period of performance of 17 months and an estimated price of  $850,000.00.  The proposed contract with the NRC/NAS is to form and manage a committee of nationally recognized individuals with expertise in a wide range of relevant disciplines who will develop a written report containing advice on the full range of issues raised in the public debate about the acceptance, review, and reliance on third party, human toxicity research.  The committee will be overseen by the NRC's Science, Technology, and Law Program. The committee will not develop EPA policy; rather, EPA will consider the committee's advice in developing Agency policy on these issues.   The anticipated contract will have five distinct tasks: 	1.  Establishment of a committee of national experts in the range of disciplines relevant to the issues concerning the conduct and use of data from third party research with human subjects. 	2.  A range of activities to assure that the committee process is unbiased and transparent and affords opportunities for public participation. 	3.   Information collection and solicitation of public views. 	4.  Preparation and submission to EPA of a draft committee report. 	5.  Preparation and submission to EPA of a final committee report. The NRC/NAS is uniquely qualified to develop the advice required in the report.  The NRC/NAS were established by Congress to provide independent advice to the Federal Government on critical matters of science, technology and medicine by enlisting the participation of the nation's top scientists, doctors and other experts.  See note 22.

This project is the second phase in a multiphase construction project that will construct a new office, laboratory, and research campus for the FDA at White Oak.  The site, located one mile north on New Hampshire Avenue off the Capital Beltway, is the former US Navy facility at the Federal Research Center - Naval Ordinance Laboratory in White Oak, Silver Spring, MD.  Five phases are planned in total, with phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Laboratory Facility (111,250 gsf) [awarded September 2001; estimated completion early 2003]; Phase 2 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office Building (551,247 gsf); Phase 3 - Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Laboratory & Office (1,117,216 gsf); Phase 4 - Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Laboratory & Office (879,073 gsf); and Phase 5 - Office of Commissioner (OC) & Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Offices (455,796 gsf).  The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements. The contractor will perform the superstructure construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract.  The estimated construction cost range is between $50 - $60 million.  The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 608 calendar days (20 months).  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 233320 and the Size Standard is $28.5 million.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  1.  EXPERIENCE.  (1) The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) office projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation, and meets all the following characteristics: (a) New construction was for an office building including site, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection systems for the core and shell;  (b) The project met one (1) of the following criteria: (i) The building size was not less than 250,000 gross square feet, or (ii) The construction cost at award of the construction contract was not less that $50 million for the complete core and shell. (2) The offeror may demonstrate its experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of five (5) additional projects within the past ten (10) years, which are comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation.  (3) The offeror shall submit Data and/or Information for each Project (three minimum to seven maximum) presented, in accordance with the RFP.  (4.) Experience of Sub Contractors must be submitted in the format (a-u) of Item 3 under this factor.  All offerors can identify up to two (2) subcontractors for each of the following trades: Concrete, Mechanical, Electrical, Curtain Wall and Exterior Framing. There will be no substitutions of subcontractors after the selection is made, unless otherwise approved by the CO. The subcontractors must demonstrate their experience by listing three (3) projects, within the past ten (10) years, which are comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation as defined above.  The final price proposal will include the offeror's selected subcontractors (one for each trade).  2.  PAST PERFORMANCE. This factor considers the extent of the offeror's past performance with reference to such aspects as costs, timeliness, and technical success as part of the consideration.  Consideration includes: (1) The offeror has a track record of satisfactory performance as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) office projects, within the past ten (10) years; (2) The offeror shall submit the following information on the two (2) minimum, up to seven (7) maximum for each submitted project.  Give project title, location and reference who may be contacted regarding the quality of your performance. Indicate name, title, company name, current company address, and phone number of each reference.  3.  KEY PERSONNEL. This factor considers the qualifications of the key personnel proposed by the offeror to execute the contract requirements for the positions proposed. Offerors must submit resumes of the individuals proposed for the following positions: Contract Executive, Project Manager, General Superintendent, and Quality Control Supervisor.  Considerations include: (1) Educational background; (2) Experience on similar projects in a position comparable to that for which they are being proposed; (3) Certification or professional registration held by the individuals proposed for key personnel positions.  4.  MANAGEMENT PLAN & SCHEDULE. This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.  The Offeror must submit a proposed total contract duration in calendar days, which shall not exceed 608 calendar days (20 months) from the Notice to Proceed.  The duration proposed by the offeror, if successful on this procurement, shall become the official time of performance for this contract.  Considerations include:  (1) Submission of a detailed logic diagram, arrow-on-arrow (minimum 200 activities), illustrating the proposed sequencing of work and clearly defining the critical path.  Submittals, including shop drawings and samples and long lead time items should be indicated as separate activities; (2) Submission of a tabular schedule printout indicating, at a minimum, activity, activity duration and total float; (3) Submission of a narrative management plan describing how the offeror intends to execute the work in the field. Particular attention should be placed on the sequencing of work and on how the offeror intents to manage their subcontractors in order to ensure a smooth working relationship with the occupants of the building. The offeror should also discuss their procedures to ensure strict quality control relative to both workmanship and materials.  5.  SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  The GSA goals for subcontracting are as follows: small businesses at least 41% of total subcontracting planned; small disadvantaged businesses at least 12% of small business subcontracting planned and small women-owned businesses at least 5% of small business subcontracting planned.  The requirements of FAR 52.219-9 must be followed explicitly.  PERCENTAGE VALUES RELATIVE TO EACH EVALUATION FACTOR ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE RFP.  The General Services Administration will only make this RFP available electronically at www.eps.gov.  GSA intends to upload the RFP at this site on July 16, 2002.  This site provides instructions for downloading the RFP.  There will be no bidders' list established for this solicitation.  In accordance with the requirements of the RFP, technical proposals shall be submitted by August 16, 2002, by 3:00 PM, EST, to the following address:  GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPY) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business concerns.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to submit a technical proposal and so state that they are Women-Owned.  All responsible sources may submit a technical proposal package, which will be considered by the agency.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS IS A ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT, POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.
The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, seeks computer-related support for its biostatisticians, epidemiologists, geneticists and other DCEG professionals.  The DCEG seeks a contractor with documented successful experience in managing and coordinating staff in performance of varied and simultaneous biomedical related projects of comparable size and complexity.  This computer-related support falls into four main categories: 1) Data Management activities; 2) Systems Design and Development; 3) Statistical Analysis and Modeling and 4) Statistical Methodology and Programming Support.  Data Management involves designing, programming, testing, documentation and maintenance support for computer routines to facilitate keying, formatting and editing data collected from field studies.  Systems Design and Development entails defining technical specification requirements and developing the program language code required to implement automated solutions.  Statistical analysis and modeling involves using standard software packages and developing specialized software to carry out analyses under the general guidance of DCEG personnel.  Statistical methodology and programming support requires a higher skill level in the area of programming, mathematics and statistics than that required in support of most of the analysis tasks.  Support in this area requires a background equivalent to a Masters or Doctorate in the associated fields.  The contractor will develop and/or utilize efficient data handling analytic computer systems, programs and routines to manage and analyze large sets of biomedical data involving complex data management and analyses requirements. The proposed contract will be a cost-reimbursement type contract with award term incentives.  The contract award will be a five-year work assignment managed contract with two one year options.  Award of the options will be based upon successful performance by the selected contractor.  The contract requires a level of effort of 975,660 direct labor hours including options.  The proposed contract will be a 100% small-business set aside,   NAICS Code 514210, with a size standard of $21,000,000.

<DESC>This announcement amends Request for Information (RF) announcement BEP23 previously issued on May 31, 2002, updated on June 3, 2002, and amended as BEP23-1 on June 25, 2002.  The BEP is seeking qualified sources of supply to automate its storage, retrieval and delivery system for materials and finished goods.  This announcement provides additional information, as follows:  
Question:  The stated AVERAGE transfer is in "qty. of pallets per day" while the PEAK is in "qty. of pallets per hour".  Please advise. Answer: Based on our current procedures and practices, we tend to accumulate one or more days worth of work in an area before it is transferred to the next area.  The result is that the average quantity movement per day can be moved to the next area at one time, rather than throughout the course of a day.   This results in a peak movement per hour that is high compared to the daily average.  Please note that while the average and peak movement quantities shown reflect our current practices, they do not necessarily represent our future practice, depending on the final material handling solution selected.  That is, the solution may involve moving finished goods from one area to another as the work is completed, rather than accumulating finished goods in large quantities before transferring them to the next process.
Question:  Will any additional building layout information be available before the new response date?  It would be helpful to receive drawings of the halls at the basement and finished goods packaging areas, including the ceiling heights.  Answer:  We are not able to release any additional drawings of the areas at this time.  Question:  Can you give me exact dimensions of the individual cash pack?  Answer:  The cash packages have the following dimensions/variations.Height		5 1/8" to 5 3/8" 
Width		12 3/8" to 12 3/4" Length		17 5/8" to 17 7/8"  Question:	Is the concept of moving the individual cash packs from the process finishing room to storage, preparation and queuing feasible?  Answer:  We will consider this possibility.  Question:  If this concept is feasible, does the possibility of another meeting or conference call to gain additional info to better estimate cost of such a system exist?
Answer: We will not have additional meetings or tours before the response date of July 12, 2002. Question:  How many finished product packages are on a pallet and how are they stacked?  Answer:  There are 40 finished product packages on a pallet.  The packages are stacked five to each level, eight levels high.  Each pallet has a top that has the same footprint as the pallet platform and is approximately 2? thick.  The top is placed on each finished goods stack and each finished pallet is stretch wrapped to hold the packages and top in place.  Question:  Is there any overhang on the pallet?  Answer:  The finished goods packages fit within the footprint of the pallet and top.  However, there may be some shifting of the load during stretch wrapping or movement from one area to another.  Question:  What are the weights of the pallet, finished goods package, and the total load?  Answer:  Each package weighs approximately 32 pounds.  The pallet weighs approximately 43 pounds.  The total load (finished goods packages, pallet, and top) weighs between 1,325 and 1,400 pounds.  Question:  What is the height of the load?  Answer:  The load height is approximately 50? to 52?.
Question:  Is the BEP?s internal system mainframe or Windows based?  Answer:  The BEP?s internal system is mainframe based.
Question:  Although it is mentioned in passing, I assume that we are not to consider the main office warehouse facility in our response.  Answer:  At this time, it is not necessary to consider the main office warehouse in your response.
The time and date for responses and other materials of interest to the Government remains unchanged at close of business July 12, 2002.  No additional facility tours can be scheduled at this time.  Technical point of contact is James Swann at 202-874-0108.  Procurement point of contact is George Robertson at 202-874-3255.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) hereby amends the combined synopsis/solicitation which was posted in FedBizOps on June 28, 2002, entitled "Serial Subscription Services", to respond to questions received from potential offerors:

1.  Question: Do we need to submit four lists with pricing by title for this solicitation or is the overall pricing structure as listed under the heading Proposal Requirement - Pricing sufficient?

Response: In accordance with Proposal Requirement - Pricing, of the subject combined synopsis/solicitation, offerors shall provide the NRC with pricing information by title for a "five year" period (i.e,. base year and four one year option periods) which shall include the offeror's pricing information for each subscription and handling charge for each year.

2.  Question: As the response date is 11th July, are we able to request an extension to allow for the holiday closure dates of this office?

Response: The NRC is unable to extend the due date for receipt of proposals because an award must be made not later than August 2002, to allow the successful offeror sufficient time to renew  subscription orders prior to the current expiration date(s).

3.  Question:  Would you accept consultant as a bidder with a very reputable subscription agency doing the actual work.

Response: As reflected in the solicitation, businesses, large and small, interested in teaming arrangements, should send their business information (i.e., name, address, contact name and phone number, and size of business) to Brenda J. DuBose, Contract Specialist at  bjd2@nrc.gov not later than 12:00 noon on July 8, 2002.  Offerors are hereby notified that the due date for submission of business information for teaming arrangements as reflected in the June 28, 2002 edition of FedBizOps has been revised from June 19, 2002 to 12:00 noon on July 8, 2002.

<DESC>The RFP is amended to extend the period of performance from July 26, 2002 to August 2, 2002.  Section L is amended to include Single or Multiple Awards as follows:
The Government may elect to award a single contract or multiple contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.
Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research?s (CDER) Office of Pediatric Drug Development and Program Initiatives (OPPDI), in conjunction with FDA?s Office of Women?s Health, are writing a contract to support research on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in pregnant women exposed to certain pharmaceuticals, which could be used to treat diseases or conditions resulting from a terrorist attack. The nation?s recent experience with bioterrorism has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack it will be necessary to treat pregnant women with pharmaceutical agents for diseases or conditions that might otherwise be fatal.  However, little is known about the safety of most drugs either to the woman or to her developing fetus when used during pregnancy. The objectives of the contracted research will be to develop information on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in a cohort of women exposed to a drug of interest during pregnancy using large automated healthcare data systems data.  The highest priority is to evaluate infant outcomes; however, a specific contract could also include a component to assess maternal effects of the drug during pregnancy.  Also, a specific contract could study one or more drugs of interest. The contract shall have an eighteen-month basic period of performance. All responsible organizations may submit an offer in response to the solicitation. (NOTE:  Guidelines will be provided with the solicitation.)  This is a new contract (Contract Number 223-02-3003). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Prospective offers are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments. The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  This requirement will be a full and open competitive requirement.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.

The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) plans to map seafloor habitat in the Northern half of the Sanctuary using side scan sonar (SSS) to create digital mosaic images of the seafloor for habitat characterization purposes.  This scope of work (SOW) addresses two program elements:  (1) an OCNMS element for the provision of a vessel, captain and crew and side scan sonar fish(es) and associated equipment and staff for operating in depths of 100 to 400 m, and (2)  side scan sonar fish and associated equipment and one technician for operating in depths of  <50 m off the RV Tatoosh, a 38 foot vessel owned and operated by OCNMS.  The RV Tatoosh is equipped with an A-frame, hydraulic winch, davit and an 1800 watt AC invertor.  The side scan sonar survey is being conducted to support seafloor mapping as further described in this solicitation.  Contractors can bid on the one or both elements in this package: nearshore and offshore side scan.  The costs for each element should be presented as separate cost items.

The duration for element (1) is for 5 to 10 continuous days for 24-hr per day operations between 1 July and 30 September 2002.  The duration for element (2) is for 5 to 10 days of 12-hr per day operations from 15 to 26 July 2002.   The contractor responsibilities are listed below.  

Project Area:  For program element (1) the project concentrates on the area between 124?57'W to 125?20'W and between 48?03N to 48?20N in U.S. waters (Figure 1).  For program element (2) the project concentrates on the area between 124?44'W to 124?52'W and between 47?55N to 48?09N (Figure 1).  These project areas are approximate and some minor changes may be made by OCNMS during the survey.

Program Element (1) Scope of Work 
Program element (1) will be between 5 and 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. A port day can be added but is not considered as one of the 5 to 10 continuous days. Mobilization and demobilization days, as well as transit time to and from the Sanctuary are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 1 July and 30 September 2002. The dates and length of the cruise will be set at the time the contract is awarded. Loading of contractor equipment at location of contractors choice; however, contractor shall plan for OCNMS staging (mobilizing) in Port Angeles, WA or Neah Bay, WA.  In Port Angeles this can be arranged by contacting the US Coast Guard and City of Port Angeles for access to the city pier.  Demobilization can occur in either Port Angeles or Neah Bay, WA and will be set at the time the contract is awarded.  Note:  OCNMS does not expect to have much gear to mobilize, mainly staff and computers.

Bids packages for Program Element (1) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

 Vessel:  
The contractor shall supply a vessel, with crew, of sufficient size/tonnage to operate 24 hrs/day, for the length of the cruise, up to 40 nm off the Washington Coast. The minimum vessel length is 80 ft.  The vessel must have appropriate deck equipment (winches, metering device, A-frames, davits, etc.) & operators to deploy and operate the side scan and associated equipment. The vessel must also accommodate up to 3 OCNMS personnel with berthing, shower & head.  The vessel shall provide meals. The vessel shall be equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS).

For this element two potential boats follow; however the contractor should not feel obligated to use these vessels.  Both have operations ongoing in the Sanctuary; therefore, mobilization and demobilization costs may be saved by using them.

				 		Cell Phone:  (360) 481-1911

Side Scan Data Acquisition System:  The contractor shall provide a SSS system to collect digital SSS imagery for mosaicing.  A tow fish such as an Edgetech DF1000, Klien 5000, or equivalent shall be used, maximizing resolution between 200-300m depth but capable of mapping depths of 100-400m depths.  The digital side scan sonar data shall be geocoded using the tow fish position.  The tow fish geographic position (GP) shall be calculated using the DGPS system and a Sonadyne, Track Point II, or comparable USBL system.  Cable out should be recorded on a common time base.

Digital SSS Data Format: The contractor shall provide the digital SSS data in a format readable by CARIS HIPS (version 5.2) by Universal Systems LTD, phone (506) 458-8533, however logging to Triton-Isis (XTF) is desirable.  Information and specifications on CARIS SIPS and data formats may be obtained from Universal Systems LTD.  Positioning shall be NAD83/WGS84 coordinate system.  Greenwich Mean Time shall be used for all aspects of data collection.  Data shall be delivered on CD media. 

Operations: 
1.	Accuracy - The side scan sonar system shall be operated in such a manner that it is capable of detecting and recording vertical differences in the seabed of 15 cm and 20 cm horizontal differences in an across track orientation.
2.	Range Scale - The achievable horizontal range scale of a side scan sonar is a function of several parameters.  Among these are sonar conditions, seabed composition, range scale in use, side scan sonar system characteristics, and tow fish height.  Actual conditions in the survey area will determine the effective range of a particular side scan sonar system.  If the effective range scale of the side scan sonar is reduced due to external factors, then the acceptable swath coverage should be reduced accordingly. The SSS shall be primarily operated on the 200-meter range scale but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative.  
3.	Line Spacing - Line survey lines shall be oriented parallel to each other and be spaced at a distance 50% of the effective range scale apart.    
4.	Survey Speed -The pulse repetition rate (PRR) determines the speed at which the transducer (i.e. the vessel) can move along the track and still maintain the required along track coverage of the bottom.  Longer-range scales have slower PRR which require slower vessel speeds.  The side scan shall be towed at a speed such that an object 0.5 m3 on the seafloor would be independently ensonified a minimum of three times per pass.  The maximum vessel speed for three ensonifications can be calculated as follows:  Maximum vessel speed (m/s) = target size (m) x prr/3 (sec-1).
5.	Tow fish Height - The side scan tow fish shall be towed at a height above the bottom between 8% and 15% of the range scale in use.  For tow fish heights below the 8% of the range scale in use the effective scanning range is defined as 12.5 times the tow fish height, provided adequate echoes have been received.
6.	Confidence Checks - Confidence checks of the side scan sonar system shall be conducted at least once daily.  These checks should be accomplished at the outer limits (~85%) of the range scale being used.  Each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard channels) shall be checked to verify proper system tuning and operation.  Confidence checks can be made on any discrete object, offshore structure, or bottom feature that is convenient to the survey area.  Targets can include wrecks, rocks, navigation buoy moorings, distinct trawl scours, or sand ripples.
	
Communications: 
Because the scientific staff may need to communicate with other research vessels, commercial vessels, & shore based facilities, the Chief Scientist or designee shall have access to use of radio transceivers & other available communication equipment.

Mechanical Breakdown: 
The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment & vessels in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the vessel or SSS equipment that is >12 hrs, the vessel & SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing a vessel and/or SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Fuel & Water: 
The contractor is responsible for providing all fuel needed to perform the contract. Any breaks from contract work to take fuel or water will be considered time off charter, for billing purposes.

Program Element (2) Scope of Work: 
Program element (2) consists of the contractor providing side scan tow fish and associated equipment, cable and navigation system to support conducting side scan sonar operations off the RV Tatoosh.  This survey will be 5 to 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. Mobilization and demobilization will occur in Neah Bay, WA.  Mobilization and demobilization days are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 12 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 15 to 26 July 2002.  OCNMS will provide lodging in Neah Bay; however, the contractor will include other travel expenses.  

Bid packages for Program Element (2) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

Side Scan Data Acquisition System, Digital Data Format and Operations: The SSS requirements follow those as stated under Program Element (1), except that the tow fish shall be primarily operated on the 50-meter range scale (but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative), and positioning of the fish may be accomplished using algebraic calculations or similar algorithms taking into account measured cable out, water depth, fish height and cable cantenary.  

Mechanical Breakdown:  
The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the SSS equipment that is >6 hrs, the SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.



Items Common to Both Program Elements:
Reports & Documentation - The contractor shall record & maintain a record throughout the cruise. Information on daily operations, problems encountered, weather and sea conditions and operational milestones shall be recorded.  The contractor shall record digitally the geographic position of the vessel throughout the cruise with positions logged every minute. Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates & recorded to accuracy equivalent to the 5th decimal place using decimal degrees. A digital track line file in ASCII format shall be provided to OCNMS at the completion of the project. All times shall be recorded in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

The contractor shall provide a descriptive report of the survey operations.  The report shall contain but not be limited to all data necessary to complete office processing of the survey data, environmental conditions encountered that may have a bearing on data quality or accuracy, methods used and circumstances encountered during data acquisition.  The report also serves to index all applicable data and associated records.  The following is a general outline to be followed:

i.	Project Introduction
ii.	Area Surveyed, Briefly describe the area surveyed, and inclusive dates of operations.
	iii.	Survey Vessel Description, Describe survey vessel (LOA, beam, draft, tonnage etc.).  Include in this section a narrative description and figures when useful of vessel & survey equipment configuration including all instrument offsets.  Document and problems encountered and make recommendations for changes for future surveys.
	iv.	Automated Data Acquisition & Processing System, Describe data acquisition software, including version numbers, data collection procedures, processing methods, and data formats.
	v.	Side Scan Sonar, Identify manufacturer, and model of all SSS equipment.  Include beam width, depression angle, and frequency.  Describe operations to include range scales used, line spacing, tow point, confidence checks.
