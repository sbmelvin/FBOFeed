<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is releasing its third and final RFI to industry before releasing a Screening Information Request - Request for Proposal, estimated for issue late 2009.  This RFI is requesting industry to confirm the data it has already provided in the two previous requests (10/08/2004 & 07/19/ 2006) and to expand on expressed concepts of future voice switching in the NAS as well NextGen transitions.  In the first RFI (10/08/2004), the FAA was looking to see how industry viewed available voice switching technologies and to gage where industry saw technology heading.   In the second RFI released (07/19/ 2006), NVS was to further learn how industry saw solutions to the NVS mission and requirements and to further refine the NVS proposed Alternatives.  This third RFI is to further verify the revised alternatives, ascertain industry's vision for the future, and to again assess the viability and direction of voice switching technologies to meet the draft NVS requirements.  With this third NVS RFI the FAA is requesting the Voice Switching Industry's assistance in identifying current and potential capabilities available on the market.  The FAA is now performing an Investment Analyses to study which of three potential voice switching alternatives might best meet the FAA's present and future voice communications requirements.  The FAA has refined and updated the three, 07/19/2006 NVS alternatives, as rewritten in Attachment A.  In addition, a copy of the FAA's "initial Program Requirements for NVS" document is provided as Attachment B.  The FAA requests Industry address the three Alternatives using general interrogatories outlined in the Inquiry Template, Exhibit #1. Responses may be submitted by E-mail.  If the response is sent electronically, it must be on company letterhead, in Microsoft Word, PDF and/or similarly formatted E-mail attachments.  The print package should be on 8 ýý x 11 size paper, using 12 point font.  Interested parties should reply to Larry.Greer@faa.gov, via E-mail, by close of business 5:00PM, January 22, 2008.   Packages not suitable for E-mail may be mailed or otherwise delivered to:   Larry R. Greer, AJA-47 Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC  20590   Responses containing marketing materials aside from the white page response may be accepted.  None of the documentation submitted to the FAA will be returned.  At the Government's option, clarifications may be requested from one, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey.  No evaluation of vendors will take place as a result of this RFI.  Vendor participation in any manner or form is not a promise for future FAA business.  The information obtained through this RFI will be used to support development of an acquisition strategy for National Air Space Voice Switch research and development. Interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred as a result of your response to this Market Survey announcement.  Any and all costs associated with your NVS Market Survey submission will be solely at the expense of the submitting Vendor.

<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-08-0016
<RESPDATE>011008
<ARCHDATE>01252008
<CONTACT>Corinne Nygren, Contract Specialist, Phone 6123363235, Fax 6123702106, Email Corinne.M.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of a proposed contract action published to notify potential sources that The USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) contracting office intends to issue two sole source awards to the following companies for the purchase of pheromone for the Light Brown Apple Moth:  Bedoukian Research, Inc. and Shin-Etsu Fine Chemicals.  

The USDA, APHIS confirmed the presence of Light Brown Apple Moth (LBAM) from specimens collected in Alameda and Contra Costa counties in California.  If left untreated, the LBAM could have a significant economic impact on more than 2,000 cultivated crops and natural resources in California.  APHIS has elected to use pheromone treatments to eradicate LBAM infestations as they constitute the most environmentally safe approach in comparison to other treatment options, such as the use of chemical pesticides. The purchase of this pheromone is of an urgent nature because the pest is new to the United States and applications of the pheromone must begin in Spring 2008.

Since the pest is new to the United States, there are only two manufacturers that produce the LBAM pheromone products, which are Bedoukian Research, Inc. and Shin-Etsu Fine Chemicals.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Numbered Note 22 applies.  Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other company will satisfy agency requirements. 

APHIS intends to award firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with an estimated value of $37,500,000.00 for the total contract period.  The contract periods of performance will consist of a base period of 12 months with the option to extend the contracts for an additional two years if necessary. 

Any inquires to this sole source acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Corinne Nygren at USDA, APHIS Contracting, Butler Square, 5th Floor, 100 North Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, fax 612-370-2106 or by email to Corinne.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov. Requests by telephone will not be honored.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Project HOPE/Health Affairs, 7500 Old Georgetown Road, Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814-6133.

Project HOPE/Health Affairs is singularly qualified to produce the issue due to the one-of-a-kind nature of their journal.  The Health Affairs issue devoted entirely to Health Information Technology will reach audiences consisting of congressional health policy staff from the congressional and executive branch, private-sector stakeholders, analysts and researchers who cover the health care field, which will aid in the continuation of the adoption of health IT.  Project HOPE/Health Affairs is the only capable provider of all the services and products that the government requires for this procurement.  Interested parties should fax their capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 1:00pm on December 26, 2007.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Navy Virtual SYSCOM (partners NAVSUP, NAVAIR, SPAWAR and NAVFAC) and other Navy activities, is conducting a rolling admission per the terms and conditions of the SeaPort Enhanced (Seaport-e) Multiple Award Contracts.  The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand contract coverage and add the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) as an authorized ordering office.  This rolling admission will result in the award of additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is $25 Million. Current Seaport-e contracts have the following  characteristics: -Offers are evaluated on Best Value -ID/IQ contracts with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price- Incentive (FPI), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Cost-Plus- Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type Task Orders.  No Time-and-Material (T&M) task orders are allowed. -All requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices. -Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders -Seaport-e program goal is to award 33 percent of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors. -Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20 percent of the dollars obligated. -Only one ID/IQ contract award is allowed for individual companies as a Prime; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes. -Task Orders are competed in one of seven geographic zones (Northeast, National Capital, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest) based on the place of performance for the solicited requirements. -Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance. -The basic ID/IQ contracts limits pass-through charges, caps maximum fees, annual escalation, and requires cost savings. Awards made during the rolling admission process will have the same or similar characteristics. Oral proposals will not be conducted.  Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions.  The Government desires an increase in Small Business, Hubzone, Woman-Owned-Small-Business (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned  Small Business (SDVOSB), and 8(a) concerns.  Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.  Prospective offerors are advised that firms certified under small business sub-categories that are competing for inclusion within the Seaport-e Program via Rolling Admission will be competing only against other prospective offerors certified within their respective small business sub-category. Note:  Historically, a Rolling Admissions has been conducted on an annual basis.  However, it is not anticipated that a Rolling Admissions will be conducted in FY09. If a potential offeror does not apply during this Rolling Admissions, the next opportunity will not be until FY10. Information concerning this Rolling Admission is available on the Seaport homepage at www.seaport.navy.mil.  Copies of the original solicitation (N00178-04-R-4000), the previous Rolling Admission solicitations (N00178-05-R-4000, N00178-06-R-4000, and N00178-07-R-4000), the original Rolling Admission Industry Brief (dated November 2004), and the questions and answers to the previous solicitations can currently be found on the homepage.  The solicitation number for this Rolling Admissions is N00178-08-R-4000.  It is anticipated that a draft solicitation will be issued on 17 January 2008.  Industry comments will be sought based on the draft RFP for incorporation into the final RFP which is scheduled to be released on 21 February 2008. The target date for the Rolling Admission awards is May 2008.

<DESC>This presolicitation Request For Quotations (RFQ) replaces prior solicitation #PRN6260408BADGE. The United States Navy requires tailoring of utility uniforms to support the Navy personnel processed for expeditionary missions for mobilization and individual augmentee assignments. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Uniform insignias and embroidery will be mounted in accordance with NAVPERS 156651. The uniforms issued to each individual consist of four blousers, four trousers and two covers. All quotes should be based on an estimated 6,250 uniforms and 3,125 covers per year. The anticipated period of performance consists of a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods. The proposed contract will be a firm fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery ? Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with delivery order provisions. The exercise of option years remains the Government?s unilateral right. Necessary tailoring services shall be as described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

Offerors are required to submit past performance information, to include contract number, description of product or service, customer point of contact information, period of performance and value. Information shall be provided for past performance contracts/experiences within the past three years. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP. Provide contract number and points of contact from current or previous similar training with the Government or commercial for the past 3 years, or any other recognition, awards, and articles to enable complete past performance evaluations.   

Award will be made based on the following: 1. Lowest priced technically acceptable. 2. Past Performance and compliance with specified Delivery Instructions. Quotes must be received no later that 0900 AM, Eastern Standard Time, 7 January, 2008 and will be accepted via FAX at 904-542-1098, Attn: Adair McCall III.

<DESC>GLP Radionuclide/Radiation Animal Models and Resources Development
RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-20
Formerly Announced as RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-09.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.
Description 
Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following: development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radionuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLP-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.
The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.
Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs. 

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about January 3, 2008 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, on behalf of the United States Access Board, has the need for 25 hotel rooms with accessibility requirements, and Food and Beverage Services in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Access Board is a Federal Agency that develops and maintains accessibility requirements that entities with responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act must meet.

For example, there cannot be a separate entrance that is accessible to people with disabilities but rarely used by people without disabilities.  Also, the main entrance must not be accessed by a lift.  Access Board staff will make a determination about whether a hotel most closely meets the standards.
?	We need 25 sleeping rooms in total.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Haver Analytics, 60 East 42nd Street, New York, NY, 10165, for a subscription to the Haver DLX Database system. The purchase order will represent a renewal to the agency?s existing subscription. Several features of the Haver DLX system make it unique. The proprietary software is designed to have the Haver DLX server transfers the data updates to a local network server. With all the databases available on a network server, the system allows unlimited simultaneous users to access identical data rather than individual users performing separate modem downloads at various points in time. The data provided by Haver Analytics is as reported from the data source.  Haver is not in the forecasting and econometric modeling business and this type of service is not part of their databases. In addition, data can easily be retrieved into Microsoft Excel, exported into other file formats such as SAS, and graphics can be imported into both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. The Haver DXL system includes unlimited refreshes of data updates, monthly newsletters, software updates and access to the Haver website. The system includes a one-year subscription to the following databases:  USECON; CBDB; REALTOR; USINT; G10+; FFUNDS; REGIONAL; LABORR; EMPLC; EMPLR; USPOP; PIQR, PICOUNTY; DLINQ; DLINQR; EUROPE; JAPAN; EMERGEMA; EMERGE; EMERGELA;  IMFDOT; WBDEBT; INDUSTRY; HUD; MBAMTG; AND EXPORTSR. The period of performance for this requirement is January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within 5 days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC.  Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Solicitation of Interest for Demonstration Programs to Reduce Traffic System Problems caused by Distracted, Inattentive, Drowsy or Fatigued Drivers

Introduction

Under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) the Department of Transportation was directed to "carry out not less than 2 demonstration projects to evaluate new and innovative programs means of combating traffic system problems caused by distracted, inattentive or fatigued drivers" (Section 2003 (d)).  In response to this Congressional Mandate, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provided a contract to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation to fund demonstration projects of countermeasures designed to reduce vehicle crashes or other traffic system problems caused by distracted, inattentive, drowsy or fatigued drivers.  Demonstration projects can be submitted by any agency, firm, institution or locality with a feasible proposal.  A total of $400,000 is available to support two or more projects.  Demonstration projects should include innovative, yet feasible, countermeasures that include but are not limited to (as examples): high visibility enforcement of legislation banning the use of handheld wireless devices while driving; measures to keep shift workers alert while driving home; high school mobilizations targeting young drivers; social norms campaigns to change perceptions of the risks associated with distracted and drowsy driving; evaluations of legislation enacted to reduce drowsy or distracted driving; evaluation of legislation banning the use of cell phones while driving; evaluations of police efforts; and attempts at measuring and broad technological applications that might reduce distracted and drowsy driving risk 

Projects must include a data collection component, and will work with the Evaluation Contractor (Pacific Institute for Research Evaluation) to design and implement the evaluation. Where applicable (depending on the nature of the demonstration program) evaluation data will be collected from multiple sources:  self-report surveys, roadway observations, and archival crash data.  Inclusion of separate experimental and comparison sites is strongly encouraged.

Because of the broad nature of potential countermeasures, hospitals, companies with vehicles fleets, and industries with shift work, in addition to traffic safety research firms and academic institutions, are encouraged to apply.

If interested in receiving a proposal solicitation package, please contact:
  
Mark B Johnson, Principal Investigator, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 11720 Beltsville Drive, Suite #900, Calverton, MD 20705, mjohnson@pire.org, 301-755-2700.  The solicitation package will be mailed out approximately 30 days following the posting of this request for interest.

Collins, Colorado, 80524. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Partec Volumetric Flow Cytometer:

-	488nm solid-state laser and a 561nm solid-state laser for broad spectrum
-	Capable of having up to 4 lasers and a mercury arc lamp for future upgrade

-	High-quality objective with a high-numerical aperture for fluorescent light collection and capable of immersion gel coupling
-	Volumetric absolute cell counting capability
-	16-bit analog to digital conversion
-	Capable of up to 32,768 channel resolution
-	Capable of trigger on any parameter or combination of parameters
-	Parallel signal processing for each parameter to allow for high-speed data acquisition at speeds up to 100,000 cells per second

The Gene Regulation Section of the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI is charged
with studying the regulation and de-regulation of the expression of the c-myc oncogene.  Such de-regulation is among the most common molecular abnormalities in human cancer, and contributes to the deaths of an estimated 70,000 Americans each year.  Therefore, it is clearly of benefit to the Section, the NCI and the NIH, and hence to the government, to facilitate studies that will enable re-regulation of c-myc in cancer.  Recent work from the Gene Regulation Section has indicated that cell-to-cell variation in c-myc maybe more important in the pathogenesis of cancer than the average (bulk) levels in tumors.  Flow cytometry is the premier and best way to measure molecules at the level of single cells.  Such measurements of c-myc as obtained through the utilization of the instrument herein requested will provide information about the molecular processes regulating and de-regulating c-myc that would be completely unobtainable otherwise.  Thus purchase and operation of this instrument therefore will advance the governmental mission of the Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI to promote the health and well-being of all Americans.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on December 31, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80019-MM on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The PLB is a first alert device used to signal rescue forces that an aircrew member has either ejected or bailed out of an aircraft, and is also used to provide homing or location signals for the rescue team.  Requirements will be provided in the final Government Performance Specification Revision D issued with the solicitation.  Initial award will be for the delivery of 30 First Article units, First Article Contractor Testing, Test Plan and Test Report.  Each award will have options for subsequent production PLB quantities for ACES II/III kits (the Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ) is 6,000 each) and production PLB quantities for the BA-22 style parachutes (the BEQ is 12,500 each).  Total program requirement maximum is 20,000 units.  Each contractor's share of the production quantities will be based on when each contractor receives First Article Approval, production capability and the need date of customers.  FOB is Origin.  Inspection & Acceptance will be Origin.  Packaging Requirements shall be IAW AFMCFARS 5352.247-9009, Military Packaging and Marking and Appendix D of MIL-STD-2073-1, QUP 1, PRES-PACK B.

A Performance Confidence Assessment will be conducted on these proposals.  Only those Offerors determined to be technically acceptable; determined capable of meeting the required delivery schedule; and receiving a positive Performance Confidence Assessment will be considered for award.  

The Government reserves the right to award up to three contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no awards based on the quality and quantity of proposals received and/or funding availability for this program.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 31 Jan 2008 with proposals due 03 Mar 2008.

Department of Homeland Security / Federal Emergency Management (DHS/FEMA), Region VIII 

Due to a decrease in the Map Modernization Headquarters Program the number of possible awards, amount possible for each award and the time frame for each award has changed from the original Sources Sought issued on December 22, 2006.  Also, after receiving concerns from a member of the public on November 8, 2007,  DHS/FEMA has reconsidered the ?Cascading? Set-Aside procedures, DHS/FEMA Region VIII has decided to set aside this procurement as a ?Small Business Set-Aside?.

General Description:

The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Region VIII requires services under the Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 to provide support of the national Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization Program within Region VIII and potentially, in other FEMA Regions.  

FEMA intends to award up to two Performance Based, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Architect-Engineer contracts to support the Map Modernization Program for one base year and two option years.  The Architect-Engineering services required under these contracts include mapping activities to produce digital flood insurance rate maps and development of updated flood mapping data, as more fully addressed in the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO), which is incorporated by reference.  See the following website for information on Map Modernization at:  http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/fhm/mm_main.shtm

Region VIII covers the following states: (Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and Utah).  In addition to work within this region, FEMA may award tasks to a contractor that requires performance outside of this geographical area.

The required services are included in Appendix 2, Statement of Objectives (SOO), which includes riverine and coastal flood insurance studies, Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRMs), disaster recovery data and other technical support related to these activities, including joint mapping activities initiated under the Cooperating Technical Partner initiatives.

<DESC>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Requ est for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Endo-Surgery Devices (Disposable). <BR><BR>This new RFRIAQ supersedes the previous announcement for Endo Mechanical announcement number W81K02-07-T-3015 which was posted on April 30, 2007, closed on May 21, 2007, and cancelled on June 14, 2007. The new closing date for this posting is January 7, 2007 and this date is established due to a change in the clinical evaluation process. The change in the process includes a requireme nt for clinical in-servicing by the vendor prior to the clinical evaluation. All responses to this announcement must be resubmitted fresh before the closing date of January 7, 2007. No prior submissions for this product line in any previous FBO will be con sidered or evaluated.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized prod uct be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support  Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Mat eriel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardi zation process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https:/ /dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and  pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>   <BR><BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Re quired<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Endo-Surgery Devices (Disposable). For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $565,297. This forecast is based on histo rical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion i nformation, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standa rdization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this announcement . Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical c riteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quote. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for  resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinici ans and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR> The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes  should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions a nd request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I:  <BR>Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technica l/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatme nt Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the not ice to ship. Failure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in exclusion from the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, using a one to five rating. The sca le descriptors are; One (1) = not acceptable, Three (3) = acceptable, Five (5) = highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setti ng or both. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their Endo-Surgery Devices (Disposable). Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will  result in exclusion from the standardization process.  The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representat ive in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. The surgical staff at TAMC is represented by physicians in su rgical residency and internship programs. <BR><BR>Vendors will also be required to provide NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, and NH Okinawa with product literature, trainin g aides and teaching materials, prior to the clinical evaluation process. Failure to provide product literature, training aides, and teaching materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group, utilizing this option, is a reflection of the stability of the clinical staff at these MTFs.  This in-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center:<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to 	TAMC. One vendor per week will be evaluated.<BR>2.	Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the operating roo m staff. A presentation 	reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and 	how to use the device will be addressed.<BR>3.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any 	questi ons, consultations, or guidance regarding the product.<BR>4.	All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility 	policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>The following steps are the training aid clinica l evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa.<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to 	the clinical evaluation.<BR>2.	Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching aides provi ded by a vendor.<BR>3.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted.<BR>4.	Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance.<BR><BR>Phase III: <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing quote based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Prici ng will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to provide a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusio n from the standardization process.<BR><BR>1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation<BR>The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/compa ny criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the vendors response s, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the ven dor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a d iscount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a compl ete product line of Endo Surgery Devices. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at  least once per month, and at least one unit per order.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783; or by email at Pamela.McClam@sba.gov 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 335999 product number 6240. 
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>Request for Information
Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS)
As of 13 Dec 07
 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services.  It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government.  The information requested will be used by the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to facilitate decision making.

In accordance with FAR 37.2, agencies may contract for advisory and assistance services, when essential to the agency?s mission, to --
(1) Obtain outside points of view to avoid too limited judgment on critical issues;
(2) Obtain advice regarding developments in industry, university, or foundation research;
(3) Obtain the opinions, special knowledge, or skills of noted experts;
(4) Enhance the understanding of, and develop alternative solutions to, complex issues;
(5) Support and improve the operation of organizations; or
(6) Ensure the more efficient or effective operation of managerial or hardware systems.

Preliminary considerations are focusing the acquisition on a broad spectrum of occupations.  These may include:  project managers, analysts, subject matter experts, consultants, program integrators, beneficiary counselors, patient administration specialists, medical financial advisors, healthcare adminstrators, group practice managers and support in the areas of division planning, programming, operations, public relations and human capital management, clerical, technical, and oversight.  The services will not include information technology/information management labor categories.  Services may be required at any government facility throughout the continental United States, any facility overseas or they may be performed in contractor owned facilities.  

Background:  Currently, A&AS services are procured when needed by the AFMS using a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts.  The AFMS is working to develop strategic purchasing plans for the Air Force?s future medical requirements that are efficient and effective.  The goal is to leverage resources, define common specifications and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments.  There has not been any determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.  The AFMS seeks to minimize impacts to existing small business contractors.  We are seeking information from both large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that small businesses can ?bring to the table? for anticipated A&AS requirements worldwide.  A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds NAICS 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) and 541612 (Human Resources Consulting Services) both have a size standard of $6.5M (3-year average annual receipts).  

If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information.  The Air Force is especially interested in companies with knowledge of the military healthcare system or the healthcare industry.  Notice:  The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research.  These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  E-mailed responses are required.  Responses are limited to 5 single spaced pages using 12-point Times New Roman font and 1? margins. 
Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements.  Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time.  Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding AFMS needs.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.  Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices.  To register for this service, click on "Vendor Notification Service" at the FedBizOpps home page.  Then click on the subscription option desired and follow the instructions.  This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. 
Please note, the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.  

Send responses to the following POCs no later than 15 Jan 08.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.

The National Technical Information Service (NTIS)is currently  performing market research to determine what software products
are available to support machine aided categorization and indexing for its digital library of Government technical reports and other information for the scientific, technical and business communities as outlined below:

NTIS Machine Aided Indexing Requirements and Constraints

Integration with the System

o  Must feed approved and/or candidate terms to the A&I records. (Currently these are stored in STAR, but this is not necessarily a requirement. It should integrate with an SQL relational database.)  
o  Must be able to be run in batch and interactive real-time mode
o  The real-time interactive mode should allow for the "re-indexing" of individual records based on changes/corrections that have been made by the analyst, such as the provision or replacement of an abstract.

Approach

o  A rule-based system seems to be preferred to one that is based solely on statistics or pattern matching through training sets. 
o  The elements to which the MAI is applied and the rules should be under NTIS control. 
o  Minimally the system should use titles and titles with abstracts. If content is OCR'd or received in electronic full text, the input to the system should be able to be modified or based on the content available for any particular document.
o  The elements and the rules should be able to be set for different document/content types, different formats, different report series or agencies, different contexts (for example based on the subject categories assigned), and one or more products. 
o  The system should "learn" from corrections/changes that are made by the analysts at the record level over time.
o  The system should allow the rules or knowledge base to be seen by the user. In other words, it should not be a black-box.

The KOS

o  Must use or ingest one or more controlled vocabularies (thesauri). 
o  Support the use of multiple controlled vocabularies for the same record (may be different fields).
o  Must work with a thesaurus of 5,000-10,000 terms with approximately 30-40 top terms and a depth of 8-9 levels, and a subject category scheme of 41 basic category codes and 445 subcategory codes.
o  Utilize thesauri, taxonomies, including faceted, keyword clusters, synonym rings, and other KOS structures. NTIS is also interested in ontologies and would like to see the vendor's roadmap for moving in this direction.
o  The MAI does not need to support the maintenance of the KOS.

The Results

o  Support the assignment of as many terms as practical, with an average of 13 terms per document.
o  Support the assignment of terms to conference proceedings where a large number and broad range of terms may be appropriate.
o  Suggest 1-4 subject terms for each subject category assigned to the document (normally 3-5 subject categories per document) plus additional cross-disciplinary terms from the thesaurus.
o  Assign of 2-3 major terms from among the 13.
o  Present the results in ranked order with an optional alphabetic sort.
o  Use all or part of the full text as well as surrogates such as titles and abstracts only. This should be based on a parameter setting or what is available from the item.
o  Support the re-indexing of legacy documents, utilizing a mapping of old terms to new terms if available.
o  Support both the creation of multiple subject categories (categorization) and index terms (subject indexing).
o  Allow a parameter to be set that adds synonyms or BTs to records based on the occurrence of a term in the candidate set.
o  Able to recognize scientific terms and notations (sub-or super-scripts, special characters, etc.)
o  Suggest geographic terms (political subdivisions and landform names) with the authority file supplied by NTIS
o  Suggest organization names based on an organization name authority list supplied by NTIS
o  Extract proper names not on an authority list and present them as suggestions to the indexer

Efficiency and Effectiveness

o  Must save time. (need data)
o  Must be consistent (need data)
o  Must be accurate (need data)
o  Must allow new analysts to become proficient more quickly (need data)


Metrics

o  Support the production of metrics that will help NTIS determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. This may be done in coordination with the input system/database. 

Testing and Ongoing Maintenance

o  Testing must be possible on an ongoing basis to ensure that the parameters and rules are kept up-to-date. 

IT Preferences

o  Either Windows or UNIX.  
o  Web service enabled. SOAP or REST.
o  Must be easy to backup and restore, possibly with a mirroring capability. 
o  At the data level, the system should be open, SQL based. 
o  Presentation level should be browser based, including the administrative interface. 
o  Application should be easily maintained, perhaps by the vendor.
o  Versioning of both the content and the application is important. 
o  Must be compliant with NIST security specifications.
o  Play well with CISCO PICS firewall.
o  Prefer that the software site inside the LAN domain rather than in the DMZ.

Licensing

o  One enterprise-wide license rather than by server or desktop.

Key Questions

o  How does the product build the rule-base? Does it create it based on human indexing during a specified time period, based on MAI suggestions accepted/rejected by humans once the tool is implemented, or based on manual development? Or on some combination of these approaches?

o  How will the MAI tool work with the subject categories? Will the indexers be expected to assign the categories before the tool runs or will the tool run first? Will the tool suggest assignment of subject categories based on the terms suggested?

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein.  

BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE. THE NAICS CODE IS 541712 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR LESS.


The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to conduct a study of brain-behavior function in typically developing children from 5 to 18 years of age.  It is expected that approximately 100-200 participants will be successfully scanned and developmentally assessed and that there will be a longitudinal component in the study design.  The result of the study will be a publicly available database that can be easily queried and to which additional studies can append relevant data.

The mission of the Child Development and Behavior Branch (CDBB), within the Center for Research for Mothers and Children (CRMC), NICHD, is to develop scientific initiatives relevant to the psychobiological, cognitive, language, and behavioral development of children, adolescents, and young adults.   One of the CDBB areas of emphasis is to support research in human brain development and the associated development of technology to facilitate neuroimaging of pediatric populations.  This project is to develop a database of normative brain-behavior function in children from 5 to 18 years of age through the use of Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI.  This database will focus on a limited number of primary behavioral domains associated with major brain regions or pathways relevant to normal brain development in children.  The specific developmental domain(s) will be proposed by the Offeror.  The database will be made freely available to the public for research purposes.  A second, optional objective is to conduct basic perfusion studies in the child sample in order to establish the normal variation in brain perfusion among typically developing adolescents.  This objective requires the development of studies using arterial spin labeling (ASL) for whole brain with a subsample of the primary sample.  In addition, ASL is important for establishing the validity of BOLD fMRI data since such data is dependent upon brain perfusion.  Such studies will allow comparisons of data generated by the two complementary methods of BOLD and ASL.  The contractor will be required to subcontract to the NIH Biomedical Imaging Research Network (BIRN) in order to use the BIRN infrastructure, software development and data repository for maintaining all data associated with the project.  Information about the NIH BIRN is available at http://www.nbirn.net/index_ie6.shtm.   

Background 
There are, at present, a large number of techniques that could be considered ?functional brain imaging.? For the purpose of this initiative, functional neuroimaging will refer primarily to fMRI. As a neuroimaging technique, fMRI is particularly useful because it is noninvasive (no injections or inhalations needed) and does not require subjects to be exposed to ionizing radiation. Thus, subjects (including children) can be scanned repeatedly, facilitating longitudinal, developmental, and drug studies. The same subject can be scanned on different occasions, using many different tasks, which allows researchers to probe different brain structures and networks. 

In a relatively short time, adult fMRI research has grown rapidly and made important contributions in understanding cognition and neurobehavioral disorders. In contrast, the functional neuroimaging research involving children and adolescents is quite small and limited. In a recent review of PubMed articles published in the past five years, 210 functional neuroimaging articles involving children were identified. Of these articles, 92% involved adolescents 18 years or older and 98% involved sample sizes less than 15 per group. The control groups in these studies are often matched to the target group and therefore not a representative sample of typical development. These factors increase the likelihood of both type I and II errors and make it impossible to generalize findings. Larger-scale studies are needed in order to make more reliable interpretations of pediatric fMRI data. 

Pediatric functional neuroimaging research has several major needs.  One is to create a database of normal brain activation in a large sample of typically developing children and adolescents.  Such a database can be used to investigate normal brain-behavior development as well as provide comparison data for pediatric clinical populations.    As part of creating such a database, gold-standards for fMRI scanning protocols and new analytic methods need to be developed.  Another need is a standardized approach to investigating brain-behavior questions.  This could be best accomplished by concentrating on one or two developmental domains that could be used as a model for investigations in other developmental domains.  Examples of possible developmental domains include motor development, memory, perception, language, behavior regulation, attention/cognitive self-regulation, and decision making.  A further need is brain perfusion studies to compile brain perfusion data by age, a major gap in the pediatric functional neuroimaging field.


To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate:

1.	A record of having access to and proper use of a state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging machine.  

2.	Proven capacity for successful functional neuroimaging of typically developing, non-sedated children from ages of infancy through 21 years of age.

3.	Professional personnel with proven experience in preparing unsedated children for successful functional neuroimaging sessions.   

4.	Technical expertise and experience in the development and use of software for analysis of neuroimaging data from pediatric populations.  

5.	Experience and clinical expertise sufficient to provide developmentally appropriate medical, cognitive, behavioral and other developmental assessments for a pediatric population. 

6.	Proven expertise and proficiency in establishing and monitoring on an on-going basis the standardized administration of medical, cognitive, behavioral and other developmental assessments required by this project. 

7.	Research experience and expertise sufficient to identify or develop neurocognitive tasks appropriate for functional neuroimaging of pediatric populations.

8.	The ability to provide medical supervision during neuroimaging of children and adequate medical review of neuroimaging data for any incidental findings.

9.	Technical expertise and capacity for establishing a data pipeline utilizing the BIRN infrastructure.

10.	Technical expertise and proficiency for developing efficient data quality control procedures for neuroimaging and other data required by this project.   

11.	Technical expertise and capacity for developing a user-friendly, queryable database compatible with BIRN infrastructure requirements.  

12.	Ability to provide NICHD with access to the queryable database through the BIRN infrastructure on an on-going basis as data are pipelined through the BIRN.  

13.	Ability to provide NICHD with a usable copy of the raw data and the database in the manner deemed most appropriate given the technology available at the end of the project.

<SUBJECT>U -- Advanced Training Institute on Health Behavior Theory
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the University of Florida, Department of Behavioral Science & community Health, College of Public Health and Health Professions. 

The period of performance shall be from date of award to August 31, 2008.


Background and Objectives

In 2004, senior staff at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and leading cancer behavioral science researchers recognized that providing supplementary training in theory to junior investigators would enhance the quality and effectiveness of the field?s research.  As a result the Advanced Training Institute on Health Behavior Theory (ATI) commenced its first training institute in 2004 and has held subsequent annual institutes in 2005 and 2006.  To date over 75 junior investigators have attended.

Specifically, the proposed objective is to continue an educational program designed to train junior investigators in the development, use, and evaluation of theory in health behavior research and interventions.  The overall goals of the 2008 ATI are to (1) increase the number of junior investigators who have had in-depth exposure to training in health behavior theory, and (2) to increase the quality of cancer behavioral science research.  These goals are compatible with the stated goal of the Behavioral Research Program of NCI: ?Our goal is to increase the breadth, depth, and quality of cancer prevention and control behavioral science? http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/about/index.html).  Key to increasing the breadth, depth, and quality of cancer prevention and control behavioral science is having a cadre of well-trained junior scientists to move the field forward.

As an ATI member, the University of Florida shall conduct all prepatory, onsite and follow-up activities necessary to facilitate the 2008 ATI.  Tasks include:

Preparatory Work:  (1) The contractor shall work with other ATI core instructors to select and invite guest lecturers to provide coverage of selected topics;   (2) The contractor shall facilitate conference calls with ATI core instructors to determine, discuss and finalize the Institute?s curriculum.  (3) The contractor shall make arrangements to reserve guests and conference accommodations.  (4) The contractor shall take the lead role and work with other core ATI instructors to select and assemble relevant readings for each of the Institute lectures.  (5) The contractor shall take the lead role in working with other core ATI instructors to advertise the Institute, solicit applications for attendance, review and select applicants, notify applicants of acceptance, and follow-up with applicants to insure attendance.  (6) The contractor shall take the lead role in working with other core ATI instructors to oversee the development of the Institute?s website and to insure that readings are posted no less than three weeks in advance of the program.  

Onsite Work (July 6, 2008 through July 13, 2008).  (1) The contractor shall be onsite for the entire period of the ATI and will serve as a liaison with the Conference Center staff to insure that all services necessary for the provision of the Institute are made available.  (2) The contractor shall take lead responsibility for insuring that all lecture topics are covered and that events adhere to the planned schedule.  (3)  The contractor shall take lead responsibility for answering applicants? programmatic questions and concerns.  (4) The contractor shall take lead responsibility for the development and conduct of a formal course evaluation.

Follow-up Activities (July 14, 2008 through August 15, 2008).   (1) The contractor shall take lead responsibility for the analysis of evaluation survey data from all attendees.  (2) The contractor shall organize a conference call with core ATI instructors to discuss the results of the evaluation survey data.  (3) The contractor shall provide a written summary of the evaluation survey results to the NCI program staff.



Sole Source Justification

The vendor is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because of these key factors:  (1) the vendor has been engaged in cancer related behavioral science research for over 25 years and is familiar with theoretical and methodological issues that are central to the field. (2) The vendor has 25 years of college teaching experience (23 years at the graduate level), most of which had focused on health behavior theories, methods, and research. (3) The vendor has been a member of the core ATI faculty for all years that it has been previously conducted (2004, 2005, and 2006) and thus has a high level of familiarity with the tasks that need to be accomplished.  (4) The vendor, due to previous experience with ATI, is ready to begin work immediately and does not require additional start-up time.  (5) The vendor has close professional working relationships with other core ATI instructors and is able to draw upon their expertise and cooperation to make the 2008 Institute successful.

This provider data-collection service streamlines the initial applic ation and re-credentialing processes, reduces provider administrative burdens and costs, and offers health plans and networks real-time access to reliable provider information for claims processing, quality assurance and member services, such as directorie s and referrals.  The Common Credentialing Datasource is the only known national initiative to assemble this information and currently has the largest number of providers actively participating.  Additionally, the database is unique in that it is a central  commercial national repository.<BR><BR>Additionally, several states have already mandated the use of the CAQH application by law (IN, KY, KS, MD, RI, VT and DC) and several others are in the process of adopting legislation (MO and OH).  Common Credentiali ng Datasource has the support of key provider stakeholder organizations (AMA, AAFP, ACP, AHIMA, HFMA and MGMA) further enhancing user level support and database accuracy.<BR><BR>The total cost of this service is not expected to exceed the simplied acquisit ion threshold.<BR><BR>All interested parties may e-mail Major Michael Wegner at no later than 21 December 2007 at Michael.wegner1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541710, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP)

The Government?s period of performance is January 1, 2008 - June 6, 2008.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intend to award a purchase order to hire a Researcher.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION:  Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAS) are the main source of new information on mutations in the human genome associated with disease and therapeutic efficacy and safety.  These studies probe DNA sequences using high-density Genome-Wide Association platforms.  The results of these studies require complex and systematic mathematical analyses.  Each step in these analyses can be currently calculated with more than on algorithm.  The list of mutations associated with a disease or a therapeutic result will depend on the combination of algorithms used in a study.  

The Genome-Wide Association Working Group (GWAWG) of the Micro array Quality Control Consortium (MAQC) collaboration was developed by the FDA to understand sources of variability in GWAS data.  This Consortium includes members from academic, government, and industry organizations.  The participation of the Genomics Group in the GWAWG of MAQC requires the expertise of a biostatistician committed to this work.  

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT: 
1. Evaluate datasets available to the MAQC GWAWG. 
2. Analyze these datasets with multiple analysis protocols allowing a systematic application of algorithms for each analysis step. 
3. Assess variability in lists of mutations associated with diseases and therapies.  
4. Determine the relative contribution of different steps to the overall variability of GWAS results.

CONTRACTOR TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: 
1. Receive and catalogue datasets available to the MAQC GWAWG. 
2. Assemble analysis algorithms.  
3. Apply analysis algorithms to the MAQC GWAWG datasets. 
4. Develop metrics to measure the variability in lists of mutations associated with diseases and therapies. 
5. Tabulate the relative contribution of different steps to the overall variability of GWAS results. 

EVALUATION FOR AWARD
Basis for Award:

Contractor must be familiar with scientific and biostatistics issues associated with genomics and their application in the identification of human populations which may benefit from specific therapies.

a.   Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.  Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.

b.   Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.


c.   FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.  FDA?s acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror.  Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offeror?s technical solution is evaluated.  This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the government?s assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

QUALIFICATIONS:
1. Master Science Degree or a PH.D in Bioinformatics (Statistical Genetics) is preferred. 
2. Knowledge of data analysis for human genetics, method development and bioinformatics/statistical consultation. 
3.  Ability to communicate clearly orally and in writing.
4.  Security Clearance to see confidential and proprietary information.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
The Contractor shall obtain FDA security clearance prior to beginning work.  Contractor shall sign a confidentiality agreement prior to beginning work under this contract.

PAST EXPERIENCE: The contractor must be able to demonstrate past experience directly relevant to the types of work needed. Such experience includes projects performed in the past five years similar in scope to the requirements of this Statement of Work. Interested parties may identify their interest by responding to this requirement within 5 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice.

PRICING SCHEDULE: Contractor shall submit a fixed price labor hour cost proposal for 1040 hours.  The total number of pages for the technical plan is not expected to exceed ten (10) pages in length.  A detailed technical plan must indicate how each aspect of the statement of work is to be accomplished. 

PAYMENT SCHEDULE:  Payment will be made in monthly installments based on level of effort (hours worked).

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: January 1, 2008 through June 6, 2008. 

FACILITIES:  Contractor shall conduct research in space provided by FDA.  FDA will also provide appropriate equipment.

CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun & Bradstreet number and banking information. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: All questions are to be submitted via email to karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov no later than December 19, 2007, 2:00pm EST. 

QUOTATIONS DUE: All quotations are due, via email to: karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 2:00pm, EST on Thursday, December 27, 2007.   

ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE: The anticipated award date is December 31, 2007; however, all dates in this announcement are subject to change.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This procurement is being made in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12, FAR Part 15, and FAR Part 16.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-08-R-MOT010 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09. The NAICS code is 611699. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) will award a single Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) type contract for Tactical Operations Program Management Support and Tactical Training services.  The period of performance for the base period is eight (8) months from the date of award, and four (4) one year option periods and one four (4) month option period, not to exceed a total of 5 years.  The services will be ordered through task orders containing Firm-Fixed price (FFP) and Time-and-Materials (T&M) contract line items (CLINS).  The contractor shall be required to provide services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). 
Current Coast Guard course training materials will be provided to the Offeror who is awarded this contract and course curriculums and materials shall be revised and updated by the contractor during the performance period of this contract.  Inspection shall be in accordance with FAR 52.212-4.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall read and follow the directions given in provision 52.212-1, particularly the submission of past performance information pursuant to 52.212-1(b) (10). In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, and the selection factors listed below as an addendum to FAR 52.212-2, the Government will award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is most advantageous and offers the best value to the USCG. The USCG will evaluate offers based on the following factors which are an addendum to FAR 52-212-2: 1) Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel with current expertise in military special operations (e.g. Counterterrorism), Federal or State government law enforcement special weapons, tactics, and training (e.g. Hostage Rescue, High Risk Warrant, Counter-Assault), or Tactical USCG Units operations and training in accordance with the PWS requirements. Resumes of contractor personnel proposed for this procurement shall be evaluated as part of this evaluation factor.  A clear demonstration that personnel hold the required security clearance must be apparent on the respective resumes; 2) Relevant Past Performance on same or similar procurements performed within the past three years or in progress.   Include three references consisting of the contract number, the agency or company for which the work was performed, contract value, a description of work performed, and the name of the Contracting Officer and Technical Representative to be contacted with their address, telephone, and facsimile numbers.  The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the quotations received; and 3) Price.  Selection for award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value for the Government using the tradeoff continuum in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The trade off analysis will be made using proposal information provided for the three evaluation factors listed above. In the trade off analysis the importance of all non-price evaluation factors above are in descending order of importance and, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Offeror proposals shall have three separate sections: Section 1 will include the response to Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel; Section 2 will contain the response for Relevant Past Performance information; and Section 3 will contain the proposed Price information.  Total contract ceiling price will be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1b. The total contract ceiling is derived by multiplying the maximum FFP quantities by their respective unit prices and then summing those totals along with the T&M ceiling prices.  Evaluation of the option periods shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offerors are required to submit at least 3 Relevant Past Performance references. Current, accurate, complete information MUST be provided to contact each reference. This should include contract number, point of contact, phone number and email address for each contact.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, No. RBK0E080002, is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-03. The North American Industry Classification Code is 611710 and the business size maximum is $6.5 million. This contract is a 100 per cent set-aside for Native American businesses under the authority of the Buy Indian Act (25 USC 47).  To be eligible for award, the Indian company shall provide a breakdown of their costs to demonstrate that at least 51% of the cost of contract performance incurred for labor, travel, and supplies is performed and incurred by the Indian-owned business (prime). All Indian-owned businesses shall comply with FAR clause 52.219-4, titled Limitations on Subcontracting.  All Indian-owned businesses may submit a price quote which will be considered by the BIA. All Indian-owned businesses shall be required to complete a Buy Indian certification form which will be provided by the contracting officer to the business prior to award. All contractors conducting business with the federal government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Potential contractors may register at www.ccr.gov. BACKGROUND: The Performance and Improvement and Accountability Plan (PIAP) is a corrective action plan that was developed in response to the U.S. Department of Education (DoED) review of the overall management of the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The PIAP was first implemented in school year 2005/2006. The base PIAP document and the implementation of the PIAP has been an evolving process. The document was modified for school year 2006/2007, and several of the original tasks and sub-tasks were taken out of the PIAP. The implementation of the PIAP has been subject to interpretation and was carried out primarily to reflect the percentages of tasks and sub-tasks that were documented as being completed at the education line office level.  In July, 2007, the DoED generated a letter and requested a meeting with BIE representatives to discuss the PIAP and the processes that support the document. At that meeting, DoED set forth requirements that would guide the implementation and reporting processes for the PIAP in school year 2007/2008. The guidance for the 2007/2008 school year is as follows:  Interior will continue to implement the PIAP for the summer term of 2007 and school year 2007-2008, and record on at least a quarterly basis (a) specific completion dates for all tasks, subtasks, and key milestones, and (b) updates to ensure the previously completed tasks and subtasks remain completed. If not now incorporated into this plan, Interior will specify as part of the PIAP the individual(s) who will have ownership of each task and subtask, the projected schedule for completion of each of these tasks and subtasks, and the key milestones or indicators it will use to indicate whether or not the task or subtask is on schedule.  To ensure progress, Interior will provide the Department with quarterly progress reports, which will be due to the Department 30 days after the end of each quarter. Each  quarterly report will contain (a) a description of activities and progress for each subtask during the reporting period, (b) the status of each subtask scheduled to be completed during the reporting period, (c) supporting documentation regarding completion of the subtasks, including explanation of delays for all subtasks and expected completion dates for all unimplemented actions, and d) other data or documentation as the Department may request in order to verify the completion of tasks and subtasks.  The contract will commence upon receipt of a notice-to-proceed from the contracting officer shortly after award of the contract. Within three weeks after issuance of the notice-to-proceed, the contractor and BIE staff will develop a schedule and timeline for the accomplishment of objectives and tasks included in the Scope of Work. This contract shall be for the initial period of one year, with four options for one year renewals based on availability of funds.

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDAýs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agencyýs mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programýs mission.<BR><BR>

<b> AMMENDMENT-QUESTION/ANSWERS</b><br>
<br>
Q1)"This is a personal services contract (PSC)." In the event of medical malpractice, where would a trial be held?<br>
<br>
A1)Is the contract FP doc going to be a personal service contractor?  If so,he/she covered by the AF for liability purposes. If not, they must provide their own malpractice insurance.  

Either way, if there was an allegation of malpractice it would fall under the Military Claims Act (MCA).  A claim would be filed on a Standard Form 95 alleging whatever malpractice the patient believes occurred. This would be investigated by the AF, first by your local Legal office and MDG, followed by my office (Medical Law Consultant) and then it is forwarded to the
Military Service who has single service claims jurisdiction for Portugal.  I don't know right off hand whether that is the AF or Navy.  Either way, that Service will have the authority to deny or settle the claim.  Under the Military Claims Act, there is not right or opportunity to pursue the claim in a court of law.  It is an administrative process.  If the claim were filed by a local national, we would need to consider whether it were an MCA
claim or a NATO SOFA claim, but either way, it's still an administrative process with no right to file in court.  And you are right about the credentials hearing, it may be triggered by a malpractice claim or allegation but they are two separate things.
