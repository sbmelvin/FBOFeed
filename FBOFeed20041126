The purpose of this procurement is to have the American Trauma Society produce an instructional DVD using the American Trauma Society’s current “2nd Trauma Program” course which they developed and is the only one of its kind.  This DVD will then be used to educate and train Statewide trauma system health care professionals throughout the United States (including trauma team doctors, nurses, pre-hospital personnel, social workers, etc.) in the techniques and skills for compassionate and informative communication with families of traumatic injury victims and to have the American Trauma Society redesign their current “trauma awareness brochure” to show each State’s trauma coverage by level I, II and III trauma centers using different symbols, and update their U.S. maps to show level I-V trauma centers.  (2) Gather a thorough picture of the effects of trauma center status change or closure nationally by using data to characterize those centers, and produce a report.  (3) Develop a questionnaire to survey those centers experiencing status change or closure to eventually learn the reasons for and impacts on patient care, hospitals and communities nationally. This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is 6 months.   In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.

<DESC>ONLY USE THE FOLLOWING CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THIS NOTICE: POCs: Mr. Bill Sjoberg (P), 301-713-4818, bill.sjoberg@noaa.gov; Mr. Chuck Naegeli (A), 301-713-4790, charles.naegeli@noaa.gov; Contracting Officer:  Mr. John Inman, 301-713-4753, john.inman@noaa.gov  Contracting Office: NPOESS/Integrated Program Office (IPO), E/IP - Centre Building, 8455 Colesville Rd, Ste. 1450, Silver Spring, MD 20910 
SUBJECT:  NPOESS P3I (PRE-PLANNED PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE 
The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)Integrated Program Office (IPO)(www.npoess.noaa.gov) has prepared a DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity for the NPOESS P3I initiative. This DRAFT document is available at the following NPOESS FTP website:  ftp://ftp.ipo.noaa.gov.  Please call Mr. Sjoberg or Mr. Naegeli for ftp site password.  The file folder is called P3I Announcement of Opportunity.  
All parties are invited to review the DRAFT document and to provide comments to the NPOESS IPO. Comments are desired on or before 14 JAN 2005.  Comments should be written in Microsoft Word format and should be uploaded into the AO Comments folder of the ftp site.  Please password-protect your comments file.  An additional copy of your comments should be emailed along with your password to Mr Sjoberg or Mr Naegeli to ensure redundancy.  The IPO will consider creating a file on the ftp site with substantive comments and answers to frequently asked questions.  If this occurs, comments and questions/answers will be provided without reference to the originator.
The purpose of requesting comments on the DRAFT document is to help the Government craft a document and implement an initiative that best meets the needs of the Government and the taxpayer. Comments are sought on all parts of the DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity (including the technical, programmatic, business, and legal arrangements) and all comments will be considered as the final Announcement of Opportunity is prepared. Note that this is only a request for information on the DRAFT NPOESS P3I Announcement of Opportunity; this is not an actual Announcement or solicitation.
Accordingly, no P3I submissions are being sought at this time. The NPOESS IPO will not pay for any party's efforts in responding to this request for information, but will appreciate comments from any interested party. In addition to interested academic, science, and industry parties, the Defense Department's Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) and NASA's New Millennium are invited to provide comments on the DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity in response to this request for information. 
BACKGROUND: The purpose of P3I is to make unused space on NPOESS satellites available to Government, academic, science, and industry parties on a non-interference basis (the NPOESS mission is of paramount importance, and a P3I payload must not interfere with the NPOESS mission) when potential P3I payloads help meet NPOESS needs, help meet other Government needs, or provide benefit to science. The P3I initiative provides the potential for testing advanced technology in earth orbit and validating advanced instruments in space and cross-calibrating them with existing instruments. 
The NPOESS IPO anticipates that any P3I payload provider will bear all costs of designing and building its payload, as well as all costs of integrating its payload onto a NPOESS satellite and data routing or distribution beyond the NPOESS portal, with the NPOESS IPO providing only satellite space, power, and data transfer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers' Briefing for DARPA/SPO Novel Satellite Communications (NSC) Program, Phase II
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) anticipates releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) during late November 2004 for the Novel Satellite Communications (NSC) program.  The goal of the NSC Program is to develop technologies that enable a satellite communications system to receive signals from a ground-based user located close to multiple ground-based jammers.  Phase I of the Program is already underway, collecting data that can be used to test and validate new jammer nulling algorithms.  Phase II will involve development of the necessary algorithms and coding schemes; assessment of their performance; determination of the signal processing hardware required; and identification of the critical technology development necessary to enable the Program goal.  Phase III will develop these technologies and Phase IV will demonstrate them.

The anticipated BAA will solicit proposals for Phase II.  Under this study effort the contractor will develop signal processing algorithms and coding techniques that enable a ground based user located close to several jammers to uplink to a communications satellite.  The contractor will also have to consider how the processing and coding techniques used affect the rest of the satellite communications system.  The contractor will assess the performance of the algorithms and coding schemes developed, using analysis, simulation and Phase I data.  The contractor will identify critical technology development required to enable the NSC goal.  Work under NSC Phase II will be classified at the collateral SECRET level.  Proposers must have the required United States personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to submit a proposal for this solicitation.

DARPA intends to hold a Proposers’ Briefing for the NSC BAA on 15 December 2004 at the MITRE Corporation in Bedford, MA.  Potential proposers are also invited to the final program review of NSC Phase I at BAE Systems in Nashua, NH on December 16, 2004.  Attendance will be limited.  Potential proposers should indicate their interest via e-mail to nsc@darpa.mil  Both meetings will be classified SECRET.  All attendees at the Proposers’ Briefing and the Phase I final review must be pre-approved and pre-registered.  The deadline for receipt of classified visit certifications is December 7, 2004.  All questions regarding attendance should be emailed to mse@darpa.mil.

POINT OF CONTACT - All potential proposers interested in attending the Proposers Briefing or Phase I Final Review should indicate their interest by emailing nsc@darpa.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quote being requested. Solicitation Number for this quote is 05SQ2300015, this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This RFQ document and incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24. NOTICE: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 332710, and is set aside for small businesses. STATEMENT OF WORK - REMACHINE THRUST COLLAR - SHASTA UNIT-3 GENERAL: Power Generator Unit-3 is being tore down for installation of a new turbine.  The thrust collar must be re-machined and returned before the end of March 2005.  The thrust collar was recently removed and is on the floor; "as found" measurements have been taken, and it is now ready for delivery to a machine shop. LOCATION: Shasta Power Plant is located approximately 14 miles North of Redding, California, at the following address:  Bureau of Reclamation, 16349 Shasta Dam Blvd, Shasta Lake, California, 96019-8400. SCOPE OF WORK: Shasta Thrust Collar Rework - Reference Dwg GE  P-5161764, the collar is cast iron GE spec B2A1B. The drawing can be viewed on Electronic Commerce or contact Contracting Officer for print. 1.1  Clean the thrust collar. 1.2  Visually inspect all surfaces of the thrust collar. Areas of damage or defects shall be mapped and recorded. 1.3  Measure the inside diameter of the thrust collar, four readings (elevations) top and four for the bottom bore.   Top diameter is nominally 27.945 +0.005/-0.0000 inch and bottom bore is 28.000+0.0005/-0.0000. 1.4  Measure perpendicularity of the inside diameter in relation to the bottom surface at four locations 1.5  Measure parallelism of the top surface in relation with the bottom surface  0.00075 inch 1.6  Check flatness of the top and bottom surface (radial)  6 locations  0.0005 inch 2.0  Submit inspection report and all discrepancies to the Contracting Officers Representative at the address listed under "Location" above. 3.0  Correct out of tolerance flatness- position collar on table with mating surface up (surface in contact with thrust ring).  Align shaft bore to be true vertical, then using precision grinder make sure contact surface is flat and perpendicular to shaft axis. 4.0  To buildup bore, weld 8 vertical strips in upper and lower bores at 45 degrees from each other starting 22.5 degrees beyond the keyway.  Strips to be about one inch wide, care must be taken to prevent heat buildup during welding which could lead to warping of the collar.  Weld should skip to opposite side of bore frequently.  Collar is cast iron. Weld procedure shall be submitted for USBR approval prior to job start.   5.0  Using unwelded bore, center the collar and rebore the upper bore and the lower bore.  Upper bores should be 27.950, 0.003 inch smaller than shaft (27.953 inch); Lower bore 28.006 and the lower shaft diameter is 28.009 inch.  Bores should be held to +0.000 -0.002. 6.0  Submit as-machined inspection report, 4 diameters to be measured at 4 elevations of each bore, perpendicularity and flatness. CONTRACTORS SHOP QUALIFICATIONS: 1.  Demonstrate ability to hold precision to .0005 inch parallel, .00075 inch perpendicular as specified on the drawing and specifications.  2.  Boring and grinding equipment shall be massive enough to be unaffected by this 18,000 lb thrust collar.  The supporting structure of the machine tools must not deflect when holding this work piece  enough to affect the above precision. 3. Demonstrate ability to metal spray or weld cast iron without cracking the work piece. 4.  Include with your bid package an attached list of similar jobs that your shop has performed in the past 5 years.  List contacts and telephone numbers of all references provided.
