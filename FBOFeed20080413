Columbian Way, Seattle, WA. 98108.  The design work will involve approximately 15,584 gross square feet of the existing Bldg 100 2 West Ward.  This project will require extensive site planning and coordination between the VA engineering service, the clinical staff, and AE firm. The scope of work design is to convert the existing multi-patient 4 bed wards and congregate baths to a revised patient room mix of 1 and 2 person rooms with accompanying baths.  The design work will cover all aspects of the new patient ward support facility including specialized HVAC requirements and patient isolation provisions for chemotherapy treatment and infectious disease isolation. The design work will involve planning for the construction work so that there is no disruption in the adjacent medical center spaces. The design portion of the project must plan for multiple concerns of vibration, noise, and dust contamination of the immediately adjacent occupied clinic and public areas.  The A/E contractor must provide bid-ready design documents 300 calendar days after A/E contract award.  Provide construction period services following the construction contract award based upon this design work.  Evaluation and selection will be based on qualifications stated under CBD Numbered Note 24.  The selected firm or organization must have significant experience in the design of patient wards serving large institutional campuses and medical facilities.  Applicants must be able to demonstrate the credentials of the firm and assigned staff to support the design scope. Special qualifications and selection of firms will place emphasis on design capabilities of firms with previous institutional patient ward design work and specialized negative air pressure HVAC requirements for chemotherapy treatment / infectious disease isolation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541330. This is not a Request for Proposal.  A current SF 330 representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application for each proposed consultant's office involved.  Point of Contact is William W. Thompson (253) 589 4027.  No firm or organization will be considered unless an application consisting of the completed SF 330 and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is submitted to following address: Interested firms should submit two copies of their SF330, no later than 4 PM PDT May 19, 2008, to William W.
