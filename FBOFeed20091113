2.	Background
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) provide capabilities the United States Air Force (USAF) warfighter needs to support contingency operations and military operations other than war.  It enables the Air Force to posture trained and equipped forces, organized in effects-based operational capability packages, to deliver effective aerospace capabilities to the Joint warfighter. 
a.	DCAPES is the Air Force System of Record for presenting, planning, sourcing, mobilizing, deploying, accounting for, sustaining, re-deploying, and reconstituting Combat Air Power in support of Unified and Air Force Combatant Commanders' (COCOM) requirements.b.	DCAPES also serves as the principal USAF interface to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) - a continuously evolving system developed through the integration and enhancement of two earlier planning and execution systems:  the Joint Operation Planning System and the Joint Deployment System.  It provides the foundation for conventional command and control by national- and theater-level commanders and their staffs.  It is designed to satisfy their information needs in the conduct of joint planning and operations. JOPES includes joint operation planning policies, procedures, and reporting structures supported by communications and automated data processing systems. JOPES is used to monitor, plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, and sustainment activities associated with joint operations.c.	DCAPES provides over 5,000 users with near real-time integration of USAF operations planning, manpower requirements, personnel availability, and logistics requirements. In short, DCAPES is used by Unified and USAF COCOM, Joint Staff, HQ USAF, USAF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), USAF  Field Operating Agencies, USAF Direct Reporting Units, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard wing/base planners to:.	Receive and analyze War Planning and Execution (WPE) taskings .	Access and compare WPE data in different databases.	Exchange WPE data with other Command and Control (C2) systems.	Perform feasibility and capability analysis in support of operations, manpower, personnel, logistics, and transportation requirements.	Develop, compare, and prioritize alternative courses of action.	Prepare documents that support Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, Unified Commands, and Air Force requirements and taskings.	Create and maintain War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) data.	Create and manage Unit Type Codes (UTCs).	Produce and edit Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD); and.	Develop other planning and execution documents.



3.	System Overview
DCAPES is an Air Force standard Automated Information System (AIS) that handles classified information in the System High Security Mode with both commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-developed software.  DCAPES is crucial to planners and unit deployment managers worldwide to plan for deployment of personnel, supplies, and equipment to meet various exercises, real-world contingencies, and wartime taskings.  Long-term maintenance is in accordance with the HQ 554 ELSW/ Systems Engineering Process (SEP).  DCAPES is a member of the Force Projection and Readiness (FP&R) portfolio managed by HQ 554 ELSG/FC.
DCAPES provides the USAF with the ability to perform specific, detailed operational planning and execution that complements Joint Service planning performed through Defense Information System Agency's (DISA's) Global Command and Control System (GCCS).a.	DCAPES serves as the foundation of integrated Air Force planning and execution systems that interface with GCCS and JOPES, all residing in the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCAPES is implemented at Headquarters USAF, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Direct Reporting Units, Field Operating Agencies, Air National Guard/Air Force Reserves, and wing/base installations worldwide. b.	DCAPES is currently performing development work to loosely-couple the interface solution between DCAPES and JOPES.  DCAPES is engaged in four releases of content for the DCAPES program baseline, FY10 through FY12.  In addition to meeting warfighter needs, these releases are early stages of an overarching evolution of DCAPES capability to net-centric operations and adaptive war planning and execution initiatives.c.	DCAPES consists of a set of segments residing on the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE)/GCCS that is evolving to a service-oriented architecture.  The future of technology for delivering DCAPES capabilities to end users includes:  cooperation in an environment of service providers and consumers, a service delivery pipeline, performance baselines relevant to mission effectiveness, and flexible off-the-shelf software designed for common technology needs.
4.	Background for Unit Type Management Requirement Summary

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch in support of the Computational Biology Team requires professional services for the Configurational Entropy in Receptor-Ligand Binding: The MIE-NN Method.
<p>I. Background<br />Modern biomedical research recognizes the critical role of computational studies in biology, molecular medicine, and toxicology. The goal of the Computational Biology Team is focused on the calculation of the thermodynamic concept of entropy for molecular systems involved in binding smaller ligands to receptors located on larger macromolecular systems. Specifically, the contribution of rotation about intramolecular bonds and the constraint of associated energetics of those bonds with binding of ligands is the focus of the Configurational Entropy Project.<br />The mission of the Computational Biology Team is focused on modeling and quantitatively estimating entropy using the fundamental and well established theories of statistical mechanics. In collaboration with key investigators at the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology (CARB) at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, the Team has successfully identified a tractable method to deal with the most challenging aspect of modeling the energetics of binding-the configurational entropy.1 It combines the theory of mutual information expansion (MIE) originally identified by CARB investigators2 with the non-parametric methods of nearest neighbor (NN) estimation of entropy identified by the Team.3 It is called the MIE-NN method. This appears to be a novel method with far reaching implications in the fields of chemical toxicity characterization and of drug design. Initial successes in simple molecular systems are being validated in more realistic systems, and expanded to include effects of solvation and ion binding.<br />II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract<br />1. Implement software needed to estimate configurational entropy with the MIE-NN method, allowing for calculations in large systems with several hundred variables. Due to the sheer physical size of computer files used and the number of variables analyzed for such large systems (e.g. cyclodextrin and ER&#61537;), an enormous burden is placed on computer resources to read and edit these files. It is necessary to develop software procedures to provide an accurate, efficient, and robust solution to this demand. The hardware and software systems must allow for several MIE calculations to be run concurrently and results of these calculations to subsequently undergo a process of concatenation/compilation to achieve final configurational entropy estimates.</p>
<p>The computational system must allow ongoing calculations to be stopped and then restarted due to unexpected events (e.g. prolonged power failure, system updates that require rebooting, etc.) or software upgrades that provide significant increases in efficiency. All these factors may result in the output being significantly fragmented but salvageable. In order to avoid possible human error in the concatenation/compilation process, it must be highly automated to obtain final MIE NN based entropy estimations.</p>
<p>Lastly, the software system underlying the MIE-NN method of configurational entropy estimation is ready to be incorporated into a computer platform publically available to computational physicists, chemists, and biologists. This is a major goal of this contract.<br />2. As a specific extension of previous collaborations with CARB, a protein structure that meets NIOSH mission needs has been identified. This addresses the need to develop the MIE-NN approach in a biologically natural receptor-ligand system. It is the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#61537;) protein. This system meets needs to have a computationally tractable model to elucidate important methodological issues still inherent to validating the MIE-NN approach; and it will contribute significantly to practical needs to estimate binding affinities for molecular systems with potential toxicities. The molecular dynamics simulation of positional and energetic states is currently in progress, and remains to be monitored and completed during the course of this contract.</p>
<p>In addition, MIE-NN calculations for the dipyridyl/ethyleneurea model system are to be concluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCG-2010-77967, CDC NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or e-mail to RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or FAX to 304-285-6083. Phone 304-285-5880. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with the University of Maryland, Biotechnology Institute, 701 East Pratt Street, Suite 200, Baltimore, MD 21202-3101 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notic</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award one Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to assist the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) in distributing data to the research community and the general public. This IDIQ will encompass a variety of data activities including database development, database management, data dissemination and data support. The purpose of this contract is to combine the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) contracts. The CCW was mandated by Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) to develop a process to disseminate data to health services researchers studying ways to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care provided to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. The CCW houses identifiable data that is linked, at the individual patient level, for all Medicare claims, eligibility data, nursing home and home health assessments, and CMS beneficiary survey data. This data warehouse is designed to support research, policy analysis, quality improvement activities, and demonstrations that attempt to foster a better understanding of how to improve the quality of life and contain the health care costs of the chronically ill. In 2005, CMS created the RDDC to help CMS disseminate data in a more efficient and timely manner. CMS decided to contract out the processing and dissemination portion of the data request process which involves data recovery fees. Establishing the RDDC has enabled CMS to satisfy research requests in a timely and efficient manner and eliminate the burden on the CMS data center. The CCW and RDDC contracts are currently held by Buccaneer Computer Systems &amp; Service, Inc. (BCSSI) under two separate contracts. The CCW database fulfills research requests using identifiable data while the RDDC database fulfills requests for Limited Data Sets (LDS), which are partially de-identified data, and Public Use Files (PUF). This new contract will combine the two contracts into one. The contractor will use the infrastructure that has been developed by BCSSI (and paid for by CMS) to combine the current CCW and RDDC computer hardware, database design, and data extraction tools into one database. In addition, the contractor needs to demonstrate that their data center will be FISMA compliant within 60 days of award of contract.The period of performance is one (1) year with four (4) one-year options. We anticipate this solicitation to be posted to the FedBizOps in about fifteen (15) days.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, IT IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ENTITLED: BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT (BLOS)
The US Department of the Interior, National Business Center (DOI/NBC) Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, AZ, has a new requirement for a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications relay system for  Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) to support deployed forces. As an element of market research, DOI/NBC is submitting a Sources Sought Announcement to determine if there are contractors that can meet the requirements of the below Statement of Work (SOW).
Please note that the SOW requires a significantly broad range of technical capability in a very unique field. Any contractor that believes they can fulfill the SOW requirements should submit a capabilities statement in response to this announcement.  Please note that DOI/NBC is not requesting complete proposals.  Please send only a capabilities statement.  
STATEMENT OF WORK
1.0 Scope.  US Army requires a beyond line of sight communications relay system for the Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) to support deployed forces.  Numerous unattended ground sensor systems are deployed in the theater to detect and prosecute targets.  Currently there is no effective means for the transmission of this data to friendly forces.  The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) system will rapidly disseminate sensor data to the field to enhance force protection and improve targeting times.1.1 Basic requirements:1.1.1 Multipoint to Multipoint communications capabilities1.1.2 IP based1.1.3 Quad band GSM, SAT, serial, USB and Ethernet capabilities1.1.4 Path of least resistance transmission1.1.5 Nonproprietary and open standards1.2 . Objective.  A Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) network will improve intelligence operations, situational awareness and force protection for the commander by providing an effective UGS communications network.  The network will provide critical intelligence in a timely manner to deployed forces and significantly reduce the sensor-to-shooter kill-chain.  The system will automatically route the sensor data to nodes that are registered to receive notifications.1.3 Background. Current sensors are not effectively networked and do not provide sensor data to our deployed forces within the theater.  Currently, sensor data is delivered to CONUS locations for review and analysis.  After analysis, the data is then disseminated to theater forces.  This results in inherent delays in the processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) of the sensor data.  
The intent of the BLOS communications network is to allow numerous disparate sensor types to share the same communications infrastructure.  As future sensors are fielded they can be integrated into the system.  The dynamic battle space changes the areas of operation, necessitating changes in the system through the addition or removal of network nodes.  Such changes are possible because the system is an open system able to interface with the Global Information grid.
The BLOS communications network primarily uses commercial communication standards and protocols modified for military purposes.  This approach allows the BLOS to take the most modern, proven fielded technology, supported by industrial standards bodies.  Then customize it to fit the specific military purpose. 
The goal of this program is to improve intelligence operations by providing a communications network that will provide a BLOS network for the remote sensors.  
2.0 Requirements.  The following tasks and sub-tasks must be performed as defined below. Specific task deliverables are identified within each subtask.2.1 Task 1- Prepare plan for the development/repair of the communications relay system (CRS), there are four (4).2.2 Task 2 - Execute Plan 2.2.1 Platform shall have the following interfaces at a minimum: 10/100 Ethernet, USB 2.0 x1, RS-232 x22.2.2 Platform shall have capability of communicating using: Quad band GSM, Wireless Ethernet (802.11 b/g), Iridium RUDICS, Iridium SBD, McQ, Scorpion radio2.2.3 Platform shall have non-volatile memory.2.2.4 Platform shall have the following power capabilities: AC power 100-240v/ 50-60hz, DC power 12v-24v, DC power military battery (BA 5390), Battery parameter reporting, 2.2.5 Platform may use Linux operating system.2.2.6 Platform shall not have an internal battery.2.2.6.1 Platform shall have physical dimensions less than  10" Wide X 10" Deep by 7" High; and weigh less than 12 lbs2.2.7 Development of a remote configuration system capability:2.2.7.1 System shall have user specific login name and password capability, (secure login).2.2.7.2 System shall have the capability of user/group defined privileges.2.2.7.3 System shall support secure communication between the multi-sensor platform and the remote configuration system. 2.2.7.4 System shall have the capable of remote web access by means of a PC or laptop, not browser specific.2.2.7.5 The system shall have the capability of: Dynamically re-tasking the sensor reporting destinations dynamically re-tasking the sensor reporting routing tables2.2.7.5.1 Altering multi-sensor hardware platform sleep/wake patterns2.2.7.5.2 Translation between CDIF and SMS2.2.7.5.3  Operate as a Command Host or a Device Manager.2.3 Task 3-Create Test Plan 2.3.1 Test Plan: The contractor shall demonstrate to the government their ability to meet the technical specifications required by the contract.

<DESC>National Park Service (NPS) under U.S Department of the Interior (DOI)  is procuring Implementation of the Final White-tailed Deer Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) at Valley Forge National Historical Park in Southeastern Pennsylvania in 2009.
In 2009, a Final White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (Final plan/EIS) was completed for the park.  The purpose of the plan is to provide a strategy for managing deer in the park that supports long-term protection, preservation, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural and cultural resources.  The secondary purpose of the plan is to provide appropriate response to chronic wasting disease. This project will provide for implementation of the selected NPS deer management alternative (Alternative D: Combined Lethal and Non-Lethal Actions) as described in the Final plan/EIS and documented in the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final plan/EIS, approved in October 2009).  To obtain information of Final Plan/EIS and the Record of Decision, please visit the following website: http://www.nps.gov/vafo/parkmgmt/white-tailed-deer.htm
The objectives of this project are (1) to reduce the density of white-tailed deer within Valley Forge National Historical Park from an estimated 241 deer per square mile (1,277 deer) to the initial deer density goal of 31-35 deer per square mile (165-185 deer), and (2) to maintain the deer density at 31-35 deer per square mile (165-185 deer).  
Major actions will be divided into two phases of work that reflect project objectives.  Phase I (population reduction) will involve use of lethal methods (sharpshooting and capture and euthanasia) to achieve population reduction.  Phase II (population maintenance) will involve use of lethal methods to maintain the white-tailed deer population at the target deer density.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541711   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Affymetrix Inc., 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 for the acquisition of Affymetrix  GeneChips. These GeneChips aredesigned to be used with the existing Affymetrix Instrument System that is located at EPA and can not be utilized with any other existing fluorescent scanner on the market today because of the unique chip design. Future experiments will generate data to be compared with existing Affymetrix data sets at the EPA. Consistency in platform comparison is critical to the genomic scientific mission at EPA. The research application of Affymetrix Arrays requires that the chip be scanned on the Affymetrix Scanner 3000. The image is displayed on a screen connected to the scanner and analog software generates a density number for each gene, to be used in the analysis. The resource of detailed analysis is deemed critical to establishing the use of technology in our laboratories and adapting the analysis protocols to specific research applications. EPA has identified Affymetrix, Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, "only one responsible source". The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, by fax (919) E685-3178 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov . No telephone request will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Work</span>:<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) is seeking interested parties with the intention of negotiating a contract for the following services:</p>
<p>1) In compliance with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conventional pesticide registration data requirements (http://www.epa.gov/opptsfrs/publications/Test_Guidelines/series830.htm), WS is seeking development of a validated near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy method to confirm identity and concentration of a short-chain peptide formulated in a high viscosity water-oil emulsion animal vaccine under EPA guideline OPPTS 830.1800 - Enforcement Analytical Method. Due to the low concentration of the peptide (&lt; 0.1%), it is anticipated that the method will require a NIR transflectance spectroscopy approach. NIR is a novel technique to analyze pesticide products registered with the EPA, and as such, does not entirely align with the OPPTS 830.1800 guidance. WS provided preliminary data to EPA demonstrating proof of concept. EPA has concurred with the approach and is requiring submission of a validated method to analyze the active ingredient in the vaccine. The project will result in a final written method in compliance with EPA PR Notice 86-5 "Standard Format for Data Submitted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and Certain Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)" (http://www.epa.gov/PR_Notices/pr86-5.html) due prior to September 15, 2010 for submission to EPA.</p>
<p>2) In addition to the validated enforcement analytical method, WS is also seeking a contractor to perform successful analysis of five batches of vaccine using the validated NIR method in compliance with EPA Pesticide Test Guideline OPPTS 830.1700 - Preliminary Analysis. A final written report of the results in compliance with EPA PR Notice 86-5 is due prior to September 15, 2010 for submission to EPA.</p>
<p>3) Based upon the responses to this notice the Government will decide to compete full and open, set-aside the requirement for small businesses, enter into a cooperative agreement, or conduct the work internally.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit via email to Nathan Johnson the following information:<br />1 - Evidence of access to NIR instrumentation<br />2 - Scientific staffing with expertise in NIR method development and use (use resumes or c.v. of key personnel, past performance references, copies of papers, articles, etc)<br />3 - Demonstrate a history of GLP standards compliance or manufacturing under Good Manufacturing Practices. Familiarity with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) is preferred (40 CFR Part 160). However, the contractor may work in cooperation with WS National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), to ensure a successful GLP method validation.</p>
<p>This announcement does not commit the Government to award of a contract. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 30 days of publication of this notice.</p>
<p>For further information please contact Nathan Johnson at (612) 336-3404<br />Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently planning the release of a final Screening Information Request (SIR) early in the second quarter FY2010 for the modernization of the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure (ASTI).

Additional life cycle support services such as ASTI training development and conduct, ASTI technical documentation development, maintenance support, and optional contractor depot logistics support will also be included as part of the scope of the contract.
In advance of the final SIR release the FAA is posting this draft SIR for Industry information and comment.  The documents contained in this announcement are a result of the FAA's consideration of Industry comments received on the draft documentation posted in March 2009. 
The FAA is requesting potential offerors who are interested in pursuing this opportunity in a prime contractor capacity to submit a notice of intent to the contracting officer listed below.  A notice of intent is requested whether or not comments to the draft SIR are provided to the FAA.
The following is a list of documents contained within:	Section B: Schedule of Supplies and Services	Section C: Statement of Work	Section D: Packaging and Marking	Section E: Inspection and Acceptance	Section F: Deliveries or Performance	Section G: Contract Administration Data	Section H:  Special Contract Requirements	Section I:  Contract Clauses	Section K: Representations and Certifications	Section L:   Instructions, Condition, and Notices to Offerors*	Section M:  Evaluation Factors for Award*	Attachment J-1: ASTI Technical Specification++	Attachment J-2:  Transition Constraints	Attachment J-3:  List of ASTI Facilities	Attachment J-4:  Performance Requirements Summary	Attachment J-5: Certification and Authorization Handbook++	Attachment J-6: ANICS Hardware Maintenance Class++	Attachment J-7: Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)	Attachment J-8: Data Item Description (DID)	Attachment J-9: ANICS Maintenance Handbook++	Attachment J-11:Maintenance Severity Levels	Attachment J12: FAA Asset Identification Process and Procedure Guide*The FAA will provided updated versions of these documents in approximately 2 weeks which will contain content pertaining to cost/price.++Portions or the entirety of these documents are considered to be Sensitive but Unclassified Information.

<CONTACT>Robert A. Hayhurst, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 306-6443, Fax (703) 306-, Email robert.hayhurst@gsa.gov
<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought notice (SSN) for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought notice, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.

The Government is seeking information from prospective Contractors to provide an Enhanced Networx Inventory Code (eNIC) System.  The term Contractor includes contractor personnel, subcontractors, and consultants.  All contractor personnel shall be considered procurement officials and will be subject to the provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, Title 41.U.S.C.423.
The current Networx Inventory Code (NIC) System is required in support of the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Networx Program.  The Networx Program provides mission critical telecommunications and network services to numerous Federal Government Agencies worldwide.  The FAS Networx Program consists of two acquisitions: Networx Universal and Networx Enterprise.  The current NIC System (contract soon to expire) is used to create and manage codes used to facilitate ordering, billing, inventory management, service management and reporting relative to the Networx Program.  
The anticipated eNIC System will be a replacement contract to be used for ordering, billing, inventory management, service management and reporting, and validation of Network Site Codes.  The eNIC System shall include alphanumeric characters which represent the Network Site Code (NSC).  The NSC will use geographical and geopolitical codes to represent buildings, structures, enclosures or other fixed, physical locations.  The Networx Inventory Code will consist of the NSC plus additional characters representing the Networx Contractor and associated service ordered by an Agency for a specified network site.  For those locations where dedicated access is required for the services ordered, the NSC is used to determine the Serving Wire Center (SWC) that serves the Service Delivery Point (SDP).  The eNIC System shall be capable of accurately determining the SWC.  The eNIC System will provide periodic updates as well as new NSCs, their addresses and SWC mapping to ensure currency and accuracy of this information.  
The volume of records in the eNIC System will exceed 2,000,000 records.  The eNIC System shall support a flexible ad hoc reporting system.  Users shall be able to run reports against NSCs, NICs, SWC codes and related data.  The eNIC System shall be accessible by web browser interface; capable of producing ad hoc reports that can be used to create, inventory and manage the eNIC and related data items for use by GSA and the Networx Contractors.  The Contractor shall also make provisions for hosting the eNIC System and provide related support as a managed service on an ongoing basis.  This support shall cover the system, as well as the codes and all data relating to the system.  The Contractor will be responsible for providing an end-to-end, proven coding system/application for the Federal Government in support of the Networx Program.
The objectives expected from this work shall be: 
1)	The eNIC System shall be the master repository for validated Network Site Codes, Networx Inventory Codes, Serving Wire Center codes and related data items.  
2)	The eNIC System is to interface with and optimize the use of commercial codes without violating the intellectual property rights of code or data owners.
3)	The eNIC System shall aid GSA with determining and arbitrating the official eNIC and SWC to NSC mapping in the event of conflicts or discrepancies.
4)	The eNIC System shall interface with existing tables and databases established at the GSA Networx Hosting Center (NHC) with minimal impact and expense for any conversion required.
The following represents five high level requirements for the implementation of the eNIC system:
1)	The eNIC system is anticipated to include modifications or enhancements to a proven system and shall be designed to support the creation, maintenance and reporting of the NIC and related data items without disruption to current services.
2)	The eNIC System must maintain an inventory of Networx services provided by all service providers identifying the location, contract and services ordered.
3)	The eNIC System must retain the current inventory of Networx Services.  The eNIC System must also retain the current format and structure of the Networx Inventory Codes which is available in Section C.3.2.2.10 of the Networx RFP.
4)	Data currency, integrity and availability for the eNIC System are critical factors.
5)	The following training requirements are necessary for the eNIC System implementation:  
a.	Develop eNIC user training materials and sessions as appropriate and required.
b.	Conduct training sessions for GSA and Networx Service Provider personnel 
Requirements relating to the Networx Universal Request for Proposal may be obtained at fedbizopps.gov under the title: FAS Networx Universal RFP No. TQC-JTB-05-0001, dated November 15, 2006.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSAs use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSAs evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a request fail to materialize, no basis for claims against NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

Scope:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations (NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors.  Research areas include:  alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services.  The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations.  Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.

Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a drivers ability to safely operate his/her car have not provided definitive outcomes.  Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence.  The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs.  This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.  

The evaluation is very extensive, and therefore time-consuming for the officer.  The DRE collects information on the suspects current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspects pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function.  The DRE also examines the suspects visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively).  This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) Face Sheet, by all DREs.  Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form.  The DRE also summarizes his or her account of the evaluation in a descriptive statement.  Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.  

There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures is more directly relevant.  In order to determine the most efficient approach to assessing drivers for recent drug use, it is imperative to ascertain the most critical elements needed to perform the evaluation.  Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) of elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.  

The objectives of this study are to:
(a)	gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;
(b)	code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample; and
(c)	analyze the data to identify groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.

Capability
The corporate capability statement is expected to address the capabilities required to support the Scope section above. 

The Offerors should have:
(a)	experience in research methodology and design;
(b)	experience making contacts to obtain local, state, and federal data;
(c)	experience working with Institutional Review Boards;
(d)	experience in obtaining traffic safety data, including archival and observational data (e.g., DWI arrest records; enforcement activity; police stops; license suspense records; seat belt observations; speed measurement; underage drinking behavior; public attitudes concerning laws, sanctions, or traffic safety programs; public awareness of enforcement programs; crash and fatality data);
(e)	experience with and knowledge of research on the incidence of drug use/abuse, the impairing effects of alcohol and other drugs, and the impact of drug use on driving;
(f)	experience with statistical analyses (especially multivariate analyses and statistical modeling), using the types of data noted above; 
(g)	experience with drawing appropriate conclusions based on available data, and ability to describe study limitations;
(h)	experience working with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other confidential materials; and
(i)	report writing that is appropriate for both researchers and non-researchers.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:
Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the Offerors ability, in no more than 10 pages, to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, for example, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Joint Venture Sources Sought in New Media
<p>(this synopsis was first announced on November 9, 2009)<br /><br />Synopsis: <br />The business opportunities described in this notice are joint ventures, require investments by prospective organizations and provide a revenue sharing opportunity. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) enters into joint ventures in accordance with the authority granted to NTIS in the National Technical Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 3704b) and in accordance with the guidelines published in the June 13, 1989 Federal Register.</p>
<p>The NTIS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is seeking information for potential joint venture relationships that can complement existing NTIS information acquisition, dissemination, and archival capabilities. The potential joint venture candidate(s) would work with NTIS to deliver innovative solutions that increase the performance and effectiveness of NTIS and its content providers in the dissemination of government-sponsored scientific, technical, engineering and related business content. The joint venture(s) could also assist NTIS in supporting other federal agencies with their information preservation and dissemination missions and information challenges brought on by new digital and network-related technologies (e.g. web, archiving, preservation, metrics, social networking and collaborative technologies). Prospective participant(s) could provide one or more new media-related solutions that support digital, computerized, or networked information and communication technologies.</p>
<p>NTIS has extensive expertise in the dissemination of government-sponsored information to the public, as well as providing secure, large-scale, high-volume, web-based, and innovative technology solutions to government clients. The proposed joint venture(s) would serve the public, and may offer new technologies to the federal agencies that NTIS supports. As NTIS operates on a cost-recovery basis, responses should address proposed business terms for revenue sharing between NTIS and the joint venture candidate. A successful arrangement will demonstrate the benefits of collaboration between the private sector and NTIS.</p>
<p>NTIS expects to provide personnel, hardware, IT services, hosting facilities, security, program management, and product development support functions to each joint venture. The solutions provided by the candidate(s) will enable each joint venture to provide customized, large-scale, high-volume, integrated; secure new media solutions for use by NTIS and other federal agencies that NTIS supports.</p>

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: 
RECOVERY - Hamilton MICROLAB STARlet Automated sample handling system 

Notice Number: 
SS-100004-2010-NG

Issued By:
National Cancer Institute (NCI), (http://www.nci.nih.gov)
Office of Acquisitions (OA)

Key Dates:
Capability Statement Due Date:  November 24, 2009

General Information:
This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Purpose: 
The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  

As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should  such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCIs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.


Description of Information to be included in the Capability Statement:
The following characteristics apply: 

a)  Air Displacement Pipetting Channels: shall have air-displacement technology, which is analogous to a hand held electronic pipette. The benefits of this technology include the following:
 In combination with disposable tips, the risk of contamination of critical assays is reduced to an absolute minimum.
 High accuracy and precision from sub-microliter volumes to 1 ml can be reached with the same pipetting channels.
 No system liquid, diluters, valves or complicated tubing is required.
 No dilution effects of samples with system fluid.
 Each channel has a pressure monitoring system to monitor pipetting steps.

b)  Monitored Air Displacement (MAD): shall have air-based pipetting action, the instrument detects clots or empty wells during the aspiration step in real time. Thus monitored air displacement eliminates uncertainty in automated assays by providing reliable, consistent walk-away automation; shall have anti-droplet control (ADC) that compensates for pressure changes in the channels that are caused by the high vapor pressure of volatile solvents in real time. This allows accurate pipetting of highly volatile solvents that would otherwise prevent automation of assays involving robots for this purpose.

c)  Compression induced O ring expansion (CORE) disposable technology: the CORE system attaches disposable tips to the pipetting channels by mechanically expanding an O-ring into a channel inside the tip. This enables a precision of 0.1 mm on all axes with respect to the tip position during all pipetting steps. The system requires no vertical force for tip attachment or tip ejection, thus eliminating mechanical stress and improving the overall system reliability and reproducibility.  The CORE system also enables the user to confirm the size of the tip being used and also run a quick seal verification test, prior to each run to insure that O-ring integrity and seal are intact to avoid leaks during the course of the experiment.

d)  I-SWAP: an internal robotic gripping arm that can operate on the same arm as the pipetting channels.  This allows for a much larger working envelope than a separate arm system design. Since the I-SWAP inherently knows where everything is positioned on the deck based on the input method it saves user time in setting up methods or creating new ones. The I-SWAP also has grip detection system and can reach on both sides of the system deck allowing more flexibility and upgradeability for adding additional peripherals to the system.

e)  Liquid level detection shall offer 3 modes of liquid level detection:
 Capacitance Liquid Level Detection (CLLD)  each channel operates on its own frequency, minimizing the chances of false detection caused by interference.  This creates a more robust system and averts errors.
 Pressure Liquid Level Detection (PLLD)  each channel has its own pressure transducer and can monitor the pressure change in the tip to detect liquid.  This is used for non-ionic liquids and offers the user more control over all liquids pipetted by the system.
 CLLD & PLLD  the two modes of liquid level detection can be used in combination on any step and can provide true liquid extraction (LLE) functionality.

f)  96 tip pipette head - volume range of 1ul to 1mL.  Also offers CLLD on two channels for better reproducible pipetting performance.

g)  Barcode reader- The auto loader barcode reader offers sample identification confirmation for all pipetting steps.  It also confirms the correct carriers and lab-ware based on the method the user is running and also offers a continuous feed option to increase the systems overall throughput.

h)  Software shall offer an easy to use interface while still providing complete control over the system.  There are multiple wizards available to allow the user to quickly set up standard pipetting routines. The software shall offer an export package feature which assists remote access and troubleshooting by the vendor technical support.

Dimensions: instrument shall be 44W x 36H x 32D.

NAICS Code and Size Standard:
In the event an RFQ is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.

How to Submit a Response:

Page Limitations:
Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement not to exceed 10 single sided pages including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc. (single space, 12 point font minimum) that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below. <br /><br />Background Information<br /><br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) is a component of the Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiative and furthers the mission of the NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, policymakers and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. <br /><br />Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR uses communications as a key approach to achieving its strategic aims. In consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), OBSSR would like to have the initial design, demonstration and "proof of concept" for an interactive Web-based tool and interface, that will incorporate the existing CDC Prevention Impact Simulation Model (PRISM), that was developed to simulate the influence of various health policies on cardiovascular health (morbidity and mortality) as well as costs and cost opportunities they generate. This tool will ultimately be enhanced by video vignettes and interviews with stakeholders in the local community affected by policy or who are involved in making policy. The CDC has worked with OBSSR, modelers, economists, and subject matter experts over the past two years to develop a system dynamics computational model and simulation tool as an aid to policy makers. OBSSR will build on this project by creating the initial, engaging user interface to facilitate understanding of the model and its results. The goal is to enhance the users' understanding of how health is affected by social determinants and behavior as well as policy (such as smoking bans at work and public places). The tool will allow the user to move health policy "levers" and see how they impact cardiovascular disease. Such a persuasive interactive tool will not only enhance the "face" of OBSSR and behavioral research at the NIH, it will better allow OBSSR to communicate its mission with key audiences, such as the general public, NIH partners, the behavioral and social science communities, the broader research communities and stakeholders such as practitioners and policymakers to support the NIH mission. <br /><br />Objectives<br /><br />The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the availability and technical capability of an organization to complete the initial design and demonstration and "proof of concept" for the Web-based tool and interface. Our desired "product" is a feasibility study for both the Web-based tool, interface and videos. With regard to the videos, we would like a scoping out of this portion of the product; specifically, this means a breakdown of the cost information and technical details/requirements. This will be the first stage in developing a web-based tool to simulate the impact of health policy on cardiovascular health. The system dynamics model which "fuels" the tool is based on national level data and has been calibrated in both Travis County, Austin, Texas and 11 counties in the Mississippi Delta region. A system dynamics model that examines the alternative scenarios that can impact cardiovascular health, the CDC PRISM, will be the foundation for the simulation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop the initial design, demonstration and "proof of concept" for the interactive, graphically-compelling and user-friendly web-based tool to simulate the impact of various policies, behaviors and social determinants on cardiovascular health. The tool will be informed and based on the systems science model: "Causal Factors Shaping the Dynamics of Cardiovascular Health." The contractor will produce a description of the design/blueprint for the overall Web and video, will outline the requirements in technical terms for all aspects of the work, will produce a timeline for the full project from beginning to end, will develop a detailed budget breakdown for the full project, and create a detailed work plan for Phases 1 and 2 of the project, complete with cost estimates. The contractor should solicit the Project Officer's input and approval for all deliverables. The contractor will work in collaboration with the CDC Technical Monitors (as necessary) to coordinate the existing model (which resides in the VenSim software environment) and its new interface, with the simulation tool being developed. This is necessary because the new tool will draw the parameters, initial values and other information from the existing model. <br /><br />a. Project Planning<br />b. Requirements Development Support<br />c. Data Analysis Support<br />d. Design/Visualizations<br />e. Coding/Programming/Modeling <br />f. Analysis of User Needs <br />g. Developer (Unit) Testing/Pilot testing <br />h. Integrations<br />i. Development Support<br />j. Production Support<br />k. Training Support<br />l. Technical Leadership</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide in depth knowledge and expertise in these areas.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The NIH is seeking an offeror, in today's digitally connected environment, to develop a compelling Web-based tool, enhanced by video vignettes, to simulate the impact of social and behavioral determinants of health is an important part of OBSSR's communication strategy, which supports its mission. An interactive Web-based tool which will simulate the potential impact of health policies on cardiovascular health will be an effective communications strategy for reaching key audiences. It will help demonstrate how alternative policies can affect the social and behavioral environment and thus foster better choices to improve health outcomes. The contractor shall complete the tasks described below. All tasks/functions will be performed to reflect OBSSR's mission and vision; the contractor must also employ a user-centered, evidence-based approach (based on user-centered design principles) in designing and developing the cardiovascular health simulation.<br /><br />The Government will be the sole proprietor of the final documents, designs and all deliverables.<br /><br />The contractor shall complete the following tasks, which include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />1. Complete the initial design, demonstration and "proof of concept" for a Web site with a compelling, user-friendly interface aimed at policy makers and the interested, general public. This is also referred to as a "feasibility study." <br /><br />2. Develop and maintain a tool to simulate the impact of health policy on cardiovascular health. The tool will be based on the CDC PRISM which uses national data, and all work will be conducted collaboratively with the CDC and their designees, including other contractors.<br /><br />3. Scope out the video portion of the project and provide technical details on requirements as well as cost information.<br /><br />4. Trouble shoot, and fix any errors. <br /><br />5. Site deliverables should adhere to standards based CSS/XHTLM and be Section 508 compliant. Browser support must include: Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8; Firefox 2 and 3 on a PC; Firefox 2 and 3 on a Mac; Safari 3 and 4 on a PC; Safari 3 and 4 on a Mac; and Google Chrome on a PC.

<DESC>Background:
The original natural gas-fired retort system installed at the Battery Recycling Facility (BRF) met the definition of an insignificant activity pursuant to NAC 445B.288(2)(e)(1) and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) provided a letter indicating that the retort would not need an air permit to operate. The system was modified to improve the capture of mercury and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and subsequent testing indicated emissions continued to meet the requirements for an insignificant activity pursuant to NAC 445B.288(4)a. This original retort system was manufactured for the mining industry and modified to meet the mercury recycling needs of the BRF.The new retort system is a state of the art unit designed for the purpose of recycling mercury from a variety of materials and should result in lower emissions than the original system.
Objective:
To address the regulatory compliance requirements prior to operating the new retort at the NUWC Hawthorne Detachment BRF. The NDEP Bureau of Air Pollution Control (BAPC) requires that emissions of HAPS from the retort system must be shown to meet the definition of "insignificant" pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). Additionally, the NDEP Bureau of Waste Management (BWM) requires that the Written Determination be updated.

<DESC>TO: ALL Potential Respondents
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) Regarding SMC Development Planning Directorate's (SMC/XR) Space Environmental Monitoring (SEM) CubeSat Demonstration</p>
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning (XR), located at Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is seeking information from interested parties about the potential of CubeSat class systems in support of AFSPC missions. The purpose of this RFI is to gather enough information to enable the acquisition of a Space Environmental Monitoring (SEM) CubeSat military utility demonstration. This demonstration is being considered to mature sensor and spacecraft-bus capabilities to ensure the Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) required for AFSPC mission operations. The primary purpose of this demonstration being to mature CubeSats to a point where they can be seriously considered for operational use. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research purposes.</p>
<p>2. The current demonstration plan is to purchase a bus, payload, and all Assembly, Integration and Test (AI&amp;T) responsibilities resulting in launch-ready CubeSats. Collaborations between bus and sensor vendors are anticipated and encouraged in order to develop integrated solutions that include the SEM sensor and CubeSat bus.</p>
<p>3. In order for the Air Force to develop potential acquisition strategies, it considers input from industry a best practice and asks for your consideration in responding to this RFI. The Government requests a design with associated costs and schedule of the integrated CubeSat system based on the following items:</p>
<p>a. The CubeSat will meet all CubeSat and P-POD standards for a 3U satellite as described in the Cal Poly CubeSat specification. Ref: http://cubesat.atl.calpoly.edu/pages/documents/developers.php<br /><br />b. Sensor capability to address NPOESS IORD-II requirements in Ionospheric, Electron Density Profile characteristics, and/or Scintillation measurements (EDRs 4.1.6.7.5 and/or 4.1.6.7.9). Ref: www.osd.noaa.gov/rpsi/IORDII_011402.pdf<br /><br />c. On-orbit operations of a minimum of 12 months<br /><br />d. 400km orbit with either a 98 or 13-27 degree inclination<br /><br />e. Deorbit in 5 years or less after launch<br /><br />f. Commercial AES or 256 bit encryption, Type 1 desired<br /><br />g. 2 identical units Flight Ready by 1st Qtr FY11<br /><br />h.

<DESC>Notice of Proposed Contract Action<br />The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM System Wing (MCSW) intends to modify the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) contract, F04701-02-C-0002, to study the AEHF evolution and within Government design direction, develop capability insertion options with the purpose to enhance future AEHF satellite system performance. This study effort will focus on defining AEHF enhancement options which meet user demands for protected, survivable satellite communications. It includes, but is not limited to: defining capability/requirements tradeoffs for AEHF systems; delivery of a Capability Insertion Program (CIP) plan to include how the Government's investment in the Transformational SATCOM (TSAT) technology can be leveraged; AEHF parts obsolescence opportunities; and cost, schedule, performance, risk assessments for recommended enhancement options to be integrated with the current AEHF program of record. This study is intended for award on a cost-plus-fixed-fee modification on the AEHF contract.
<p>MCSW intends to award this study on a sole source basis because award to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition (FAR 6.302-1). MCSW believes that only Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), the current AEHF Prime Contractor, possesses both the capability and experience to effectively address this study and planning effort. The contractor must have detailed knowledge and experience with the AEHF Program of Record to appropriately advise the Government on strategies to enhance the AEHF system. At present, the Government does not own all of the AEHF technical data.</p>
<p>Any persons or companies interested in this effort are encouraged to contact LMSSC directly for subcontractor opportunities. Any questions about this notice can be directed to the Government Point of Contact: MCSW/PKA, Attn: William Althoff (e-mail: William.Althoff@losangeles.af.mil).</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  This opportunity was competed among contractors with indefinite-deliver indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the Department of Energy (DOE).  These DOE contracts are known as Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) which were put in place competitively by the DOE under its Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), as established by Congress.  Johnson Controls Government Systems, LLC has been selected for Phase 3 Task Order development and implementation.
The NAICS Code is 541330  Engineering Services - with a size standard of $27 million for contracts and subcontracts for engineering services awarded under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992. 
The scope of work for the Phase 3 Order will be for energy conservation work for an estimated 100 BLM facilities scattered in remote locations in approximately twelve Western States and which may include Alaska.  It is estimated that the firm-fixed price for the Order will be between $7 million and $20 million.   It is expected that the energy conservation work in the Order will include 1) installation of interior and exterior energy efficient lighting ,  2) new energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, including controls in facilities, and 3) construction of photovoltaic and wind renewable energy projects on public lands administered by the BLM.

THE OAK RIDGE OFFICE (ORO) OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE) PLANS TO EXTEND THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD THROUGH FEBRUARY 14, 2010 FOR  CONTRACT DE-ACO5-98OR22516, WITH ENERGX, TN, LLC.  This three month extension is being sought in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Although DOE anticipated awarding a contract for the recompetition of the current contract in late October 2009, it received a protest against the apparent successful offeror; thereby requiring the current contract to be extended.   Efforts to be performed during this extension will be the continuation of the acceleration of contact handled transuranic (CH-TRU) and remote handled transuranic (RH-TRU) waste processing and contract transition, which is being funded by the Recovery Act of 2009.

<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the intention to competitively award a Task Order from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 40. The period of performance will be from January 4, 2010 though September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>The contractor shall complete Phase I Brownfields Site Assessments, Phase II Investigation, and all associated Project Management, Planning, and Reporting activities. Sites selected for assessment activities are located within the I-180 corridor or within close proximity of the corridor in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>See notice published on 30 October 2009 for original RFI.  A question wasreceived regarding the RFI, see below:
Question - Once NED changes are posted to the IR, it suggests that the JTRSproduct lines "port" the changes to their platform.  Is the expectation thatintegration/FQT by the contractor be performed on the baseline waveform'sinitial platform?  For WNW, the baseline WNW was developed on the GMR platformso can integration/FQT of the changes be on a platform of our choosing (like aJTRS Surrogate Radio) or would the integration/FQT have to be on the GMRplatform?  Similiarily for SRW, the baseline SRW was developed on the ITT radioso would integration/FQT of the changes have to be on an ITT radio?

Answer - The contractor can propose using a reasonable suitable platform fordemonstrating the capability.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
 


Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

<DESC>The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office (WHS/A&PO), Department of Defense (DoD), 1155 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-1155 is requesting a quote for commerical hardware maintenance and on-site support services.  WHS/A&PO intends to purchase maintenance and on-site support services for three (3) Spectra Logic tape devices.  The tape device units are manufactured by Spectra Logic and are the only units that will operate within the Spectra Logic network backup system currently utilized by the DoD.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 - Other Computer Related Services, with a small business size standard no greater than $25M.  This is not a small business set-aside.

Please see the attached product list (Attachment-A, Product List) for the line items to be acquired under this request for quote (RFQ).  Due to the highly technical nature of the tape device units, only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) certified parts will be accepted.  The current contract in support of the Spectra Logic maintenance and on-site support services to be acquired under this RFQ expired on 16 October 2009.  Offerors shall incorporate any service reinstatement fee(s) into the price of their offer.  The service period of performance will be for one year from the date of contract award.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this RFQ; henceforth, quotes must be firm-fixed-priced and include the entire quantities listed.  Offerors should assume that the equipment is in good operating condition.

Procedures under FAR Subpart 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures are applicable to this RFQ.  The Government will evaluate offers and make a selection based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable quotation.  Offerors may submit past performance reference(s) in order to demonstrate competency in providing the requested hardware support services.  The Government is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.  Offer submittals received after the closing date and time of this RFQ will not be accepted.

Questions & Answers

Q1- Our engineer informs us that in his opinion the truss depth sizes are limiting and will not allow for the desired wind loading. Regarding building # 2,3 and 4.  Please allow for a truss depth of 30".  We find that the limiting truss depth of 18" results in an inefficient design, one that will not adequately meet the wind load specs of 110 MPH. The exterior dimension will be two feet wider at 50' wide but will still yield the required 45' interior clearance.  And the overall height will be 1 foot higher at the center. This modification will allow Shelter Structures to bid you and engineered structure with efficient truss spacing.  Utilizing stronger and heavier trusses on wider spacing  yielding more interior space. 

A1- The width of buildings 2, 3 and 4 can only be 48' wide because of the width of the concrete slab that the structures are going to be installed on. 50' wide is not going to work.

Q2- In regard to Tent 1, What is the net interior width and the net center height of this Tent? Ground Snow Load 20 Lbs? Is the 12 ft sidewall the inside sidewall  clearance?
Is the Lighting protection system UL rated or not?  Would we be dealing with Prevailing wages on this site?

A2- Net interior width is 133 and the net center height is 38.  Ground Snow load of 20LBS sounds correct.  The Lightning protection system is UL rated and yes you will be dealing with Prevailing Wages.

Q3- Does the tent need to be 133 wide and 70 length or can it be 70 wide x 133 length? 

A3-It has to be 133' wide.  We are using it to house two aircraft that are 45' from wingtip to wingtip.  And due to flight line limitations the structure needs to be 133 wide by 70 length.

Q4- All tent structures have a width larger than the length is this correct?

A4-Yes the measurements that are listed in the Spec sheet is what is needed to meet our needs and the locations for the tents to be constructed.

Q5- Do you need to have a MD contractors license in order to bid this project?

A5-  I do not think so.  This is on A Federal Government Institution.

<DESC>Q6-  Will you consider an alternate fabric to the 28oz PVC assuming all the other components of our spec meet what is listed in your specification?

A6-  As we have been instructed by upper management no deviations from the specs are allowed. So over-All Buildings Systems will have to quote to the 28 oz. PVC.

<DESC>Q7.  Question 1 mentions the 48' existing slab for which we can adjust our structure to fit, my question is at what clearance height above the slab does there need to be 45' clear for the wing tips? We have 2 options, a straight column or a tapered truss to work with and want to match the best option for your needs.

A7.  I think a tapered truss would probably work best.  As long as we have clearance for two aircraft at 45 ft. wide for each aircraft on the 133' x 70' structure. The tent height has to be 45' high from the slab for the jet exhaust plume.  This was the minimum height requirement for heat reason concerning our CV variant.  


NO MORE QUESTIONS ALLOWED DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS REQUIREMENT.

<p>(a) "Hazardous material," as used in this clause, includes any material defined as hazardous under the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313 (including revisions adopted during the term of the contract).</p>
<p>(b) The offeror must list any hazardous material, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause, to be delivered under this contract. The hazardous material shall be properly identified and include any applicable identification number, such as National Stock Number or Special Item Number. This information shall also be included on the Material Safety Data Sheet submitted under this contract.</p>
<p>Material</p>
<p>Calbibration Gas Kit, NSN 6665-01-526-884&nbsp;<br /><br />(c) This list must be updated during performance of the contract whenever the Contractor determines that any other material to be delivered under this contract is hazardous.</p>
<p>(d) The apparently successful offeror agrees to submit, for each item as required prior to award, a Material Safety Data Sheet, meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and the latest version of Federal Standard No. 313, for all hazardous material identified in paragraph (b) of this clause. Data shall be submitted in accordance with Federal Standard No. 313, whether or not the apparently successful offeror is the actual manufacturer of these items. Failure to submit the Material Safety Data Sheet prior to award may result in the apparently successful offeror being considered nonresponsible and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(e) If, after award, there is a change in the composition of the item(s) or a revision to Federal Standard No. 313, which renders incomplete or inaccurate the data submitted under paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and resubmit the data.</p>
<p>(f) Neither the requirements of this clause nor any act or failure to act by the Government shall relieve the Contractor of any responsibility or liability for the safety of Government, Contractor, or subcontractor personnel or property.</p>
<p>(g) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the Contractor from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material.</p>
<p>(h) The Government's rights in data furnished under this contract with respect to hazardous material are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To use, duplicate and disclose any data to which this clause is applicable. The purposes of this right are to --</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

The estimated cost of construction for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. Performance and payment protection will be required for this project and Davis-Bacon wage rates will apply to any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on or about December 17, 2009.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. The facility will meet Federal security requirements and be designed in metric units.

As required by law, all facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals, specifically the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, and the fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The project must conform to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings) and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS). All projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required, with a goal of a Gold rating

<DESC>NOTE:  This is a revised and updated announcement and supersedes the prior version posted October 23, 2009.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC)  New Jersey, in conjunction with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), will be hosting an Industry Day Conference for the Revenue Improvement and Systems Enhancements (RISE) Program Charge Description Master (CDM) acquisition on Tuesday, December 1, 2009 from 1:00 pm  5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) at the Washington Marriott Wardman Park, 2660 Woodley Road NW, Washington, District Of Columbia, 20008, in the Harding Meeting Room (Mezzanine Level). Registration begins at 12:30 pm. VHA will also conduct, by invitation only, one on one sessions with select parties on December 2, 2009.  The amount of time available for these sessions is limited; therefore, not all Industry Day participants may be extended an invitation.  As part of the RISE Program, the CDM Project will develop a national CDM consistent with private health care industry best practices while allowing VHA to meet the special needs of Veterans and patients according to federal regulations.  The CDM will: Provide a comprehensive listing, with the associated VA charge, if available, of all procedures, services, supplies, and drugs that can be provided during a patients provision of care to improve the effectiveness of the overall revenue collection lifecycle. Improve the effectiveness of the billing and claims generation process within the revenue system. Create opportunities for further efficiency of charge capture and billing activities by integrating with internal or third-party products (i.e., workflow products, claims processing, and reimbursement management products).  The CDM must integrate with the current VistA (Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture) legacy system and with the future enterprise revenue system.To fulfill the goal of the project, the CDM Project shall meet the following objectives: Acquire a CDM that supports industry best practices while also providing the flexibility to be customized or configured to meet the special regulatory requirements of VHA. Provide the basis for charge standardization across all VHA facilities, while allowing for required geographic variations. Facilitate the capture of all services, procedures, supplies, and drugs, regardless of billable status, in order to provide utilization data to many key systems (e.g., billing and accounts receivable, cost accounting, financial decision support). Improve billing system functionality and efficiency through the full automation of the charge capture process. Provide a secure bi-directional interface with the current legacy VistA systems and future enterprise revenue system. Provide detailed data for accurate pricing and charging for care provided to all patients. Improve the ability to generate management reports (e.g., charge information for future services). Facilitate implementation for use by VistA Order Entry and/or the VistA ancillary packages if applicable in the future. Centralize ownership, management, and oversight of the CDM.  Define business processes for establishing, maintaining, and utilizing the CDM.Industry Day Conference registration and attendance is limited to three people per company, and will occur on a first-come, first-served basis.  To register, email Iris Gelb, Contract Specialist, via email at iris.gelb@va.gov and Sarah Emerson, Contract Specialist, via email at sarah.emerson@va.gov by 12:00 pm EST on Friday, November 20, 2009.  Please include company name, company address, DUNS Number (if applicable), socio-economic status of company including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)code(s)and Capability Maturity Model for Software level, and number of participants. For each participant please include name, title, work phone number, and email address.  You will receive a confirmation email that your registration has been received.  There is no cost to attend this conference.The one-on-one session will consist of a 45 minute presentation that addresses questions found at the end of this announcement.  Presentations should be as clear as possible to ensure the CDM capability is well understood within the time provided.  Participation in one-on-one sessions will be limited to three team members of the interested party. Interested parties that participate in the one-on-one sessions may also be asked, for purposes of further market research and solely at the discretion of the Government, to facilitate a Government site visit with a key user where the product has been successfully implemented.

Elaborate on your CDM capability and associated product history to include: When was the CDM product first designed and developed? How many releases (functional enhancements) have you issued in the last five (5) years? 2. Describe how your CDM capability integrates as a component of a Patient Accounting System (PAS).Is your CDM capability part of a suite or can it be purchased separately? What other vendors does your capability or product suite interface with out of the box? What are the reasons for deploying a CDM capability before or after other components? How does your CDM capability interface with legacy systems? 3. How have you customized your CDM for a unique customer environment?  Provide an example. 4. Describe how your system aggregates data related to coding errors and rejections.  5. Describe how your CDM retains a history of both codes and prices. 6. Describe how your CDM generates or assigns and maintains a unique charge code identifier for each charge item entry.  7. Describe how the charge master file is built and maintained.8. Does your CDM interface with an Analyzer database and/or a Database Management System (DBMS) to enable enhanced reporting capabilities, e.g. creation of high level analysis graphs and reports from data extracted from the CDM database? 9. Describe the management reporting capability of your CDM. What are the key management decisions that your reporting solution enables and informs? What are the key external data sources (non CDM) that your reporting solution requires to realize its full potential?10. How robust and scalable is your CDM?  11.  Describe any software problems and patches that the CDM has encountered over the past two years.12. Describe the different alternatives for deploying your CDM capability. (COTS vs. Software as a Service)What are the pros and cons to each deployment alternative? How does each deployment alternative impact the resources required by the client?13. Describe your implementation roadmap for a multi-node network like VA. How do you advise clients on phasing the CDM implementation? What are the key challenges typically experienced when there are multiple CDM instances in operation?14. Describe your maintenance and product enhancement program including your change management process15. Describe a situation when you had an aggressive multi-campus CDM design, deployment, and implementation schedule. What specifically did you do to meet milestones? What specific related lessons and techniques did you learn from this experience?16. What type of on-line training and training (manual type) resources are available for the line employee?  Is there interactive training or manual only?17. Provide a list of CDM best practices you recommend to your customers that may apply to the VA environment.18. What are the key business improvements (near-term vs. long-term) typically realized by clients implementing your CDM capability?19. Do you have a GSA Schedule? If so, what is the schedule number and what types of goods and services does it include?20. Please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for both a COTS and Software-as-a-Service (if applicable) CDM solution based on the following assumptions: 5 million individuals receive health care annually through the system, 5+ enterprise systems will interface with CDM capability, a single group of administrators will be responsible for ongoing maintenance and updates across the seven CPACs, 10 concurrent users would need direct access to the CDM, Vendor would be responsible for deployment and support of the tool, 10 users would need a combination of read/write and administrator trainingYou do not need to submit responses to the questions above ahead of time; however, your company must be prepared to discuss during the one-on-one session.If you experience any problems or have any questions concerning this announcement, please direct your correspondence to Iris Gelb, Contract Specialist, via email at iris.gelb@va.gov or via phone at (732) 578-5476 or Sarah Emerson, Contract Specialist, via email at sarah.emerson@va.gov or via phone at (732) 578-5463 between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:30 pm EST, Monday through Friday.

SpecTRM-RL is a requirements language that was designed to be highlyreadable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but is also completelyformal.  Test cases generated fromt he black-box models written in SpecTRM-RL will focuson the intended behavior of the system.  The test case generation tool will be designedto allow the user to choose between a smaller set of test cases, allowing for more rapiderror identification, and a larger set providing more comprehensivve coverage.
