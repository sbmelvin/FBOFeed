<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  This project will be funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), DHHS, in conjunction with the NIAID, NIH.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of a prophylactic multivalent filovirus vaccine that is capable of protecting against both Ebola and Marburg viruses, utilizing platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process is used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine.  NOTE 1:  This solicitation will NOT support the development of devices for the delivery of vaccines; the development of therapeutic agents and therapeutic vaccines; the development of new animal models or refinement of existing animal models; the design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials; nor the development of any adjuvants which are not currently used in FDA-licensed vaccines.  NOTE 2:  BSL-4 facilities for animal model development, animal model vaccine efficacy testing, and assay development are to be proposed by the offeror(s). However, the Government retains the right to negotiate the most effective and efficient mechanisms for providing such facilities.  This solicitation seeks to fund organizations with demonstrated vaccine product development experience to advance development of a prophylactic candidate multivalent filovirus vaccine that protects against both Ebola and Marburg viruses.  For the purposes of this solicitation, candidate vaccines need not have been tested in a multivalent manner nor have shown protection against all desired strains of Ebola and Marburg.  Candidate vaccines eligible for support must have two characteristics:  First, a candidate vaccine must utilize a platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process can be used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine; and Second, the proposed platform technology must have been used successfully to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine candidate in non-human primate (NHP) Ebola and Marburg challenge models.  It is sufficient for the platform technology to have demonstrated protection in a monovalent vaccination/challenge study design, that is, a monovalent Marburg vaccine tested in the Marburg NHP challenge model and a monovalent Ebola vaccine tested in the Ebola NHP challenge model.  The target multivalent vaccine must contain/express antigens of SEBOV, ZEBOV, ICEBOV, RAVN, and either Ci67, Musoke, or another closely related strain of Marburg, and must provide for a relatively rapid onset of protection following no more than two doses, post-exposure prophylaxis will also be considered.  Protection is defined as proof of concept efficacy (greater than 80% survival) in the NHP challenge model (i.m. route of infection with greater than or equal to 100 pfu of challenge virus).  Offerors must propose a well-defined and feasible Product Development Plan for advancing the vaccine candidate by carrying out the following research and development activities as specified in the negotiated Statement of Work:  1) development and update of the Product Development Plan for a multivalent filovirus vaccine candidate, including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken; 2) manufacturing and formulation process development; 3) manufacturing of pilot lot cGMP material; 4) real time and accelerated vaccine stability studies; 5) conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and multivalent immunogenicity interference studies; 6) development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays and reagents necessary to support product development; 7) development, submission, and sponsorship of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, including compliance with all regulatory requirements; 8) design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 1 dose-escalating clinical trial of the multivalent vaccine candidate in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; 9) the provision of clinical and non-clinical samples from all studies to NIAID and, for clinical trials, obtaining future use consent from volunteers for their samples; and 10) the provision to NIAID of cGMP final container vaccine and all necessary supporting documentation/letters of cross-reference to allow NIAID to perform subsequent clinical trials.  OPTIONS:  Contracts awarded under this Broad Agency Announcement will include three Options that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  Options 1 and 2 may be undertaken concurrently. However, Option 3 may not be undertaken until successful completion of the tasks described in Option 1 as determined by the Government.  Option 1 provides for performance of all activities associated with the transfer and scale-up from pilot scale to large-scale cGMP manufacturing and release of 200,000 doses minimum target scale of the candidate vaccine for use in further clinical trials.  Option 2 provides for the conduct of studies to develop a lyophilized final container formulation to improve vaccine shelf-life and stability.  Option 3 provides for the design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate further the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate multivalent vaccine.  It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded.  Funding will be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for the BASE period will be five years beginning on or about September 20, 2008, with Options to be exercised at the Government?s discretion for a maximum period of performance of 9 years.  It is anticipated that each OPTION will cover a period of two years.  Options 1 and 2 may be undertaken concurrently.  However, Option 3 may not be undertaken until successful completion of Option 1, as determined by the Government.  It is estimated that the provision of total FTEs will be as follows:  Base Period:  13.85 total FTEs for a 5-year period; Option 1:  3.75 total FTEs for a 2-year period; Option 2:  4.65 total FTEs for a 2-year period; and Option 3:  9.1 total FTEs for a 2-year period.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This Broad Agency Announcement will be available electronically on/about September 18, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a  sole source contract to Diamond J Incorporated, Wichita, KS, to modify 338 each triple tachometers. The USMC CH-46E helicopter fleet is currently flying without an engine overspeed protection system.  For that reason, PMA-226, Cherry Point, NC, has initiated a program to install an electrical overspeed system that utilizes a new triple tachometer to monitor engine power turbine speeds(Nf)and aircraft rotor head speeds (Nr).  In the event of a flex shaft failure which causes an immediate engine over speed condition, the new gauge will send an electrical signal to the engine P3 solenoid which will in turn govern the engine back to a ground idle limit.  Upon successful EMI testing, prototype testing etc. NAVAIR procured 338 production triple tachometers p/n 64100-003 from Diamond J Incorporated of Wichita, Kansas under Contract N00019-06-C-0116.  Upon conclusion of the first production install, a USMC CH-46E squadron identified a unique visual problem with the design undiscovered during testing that causes the pilot to lose sight of the Nr needle while operating on night vision goggles.  This inability for the pilot to quickly scan the gauges is a flight hazard that can result in a rotor head overspeed condition that must be rectified before proceeding with installs.  As the original equipment manufacturer, Diamond J Inc, is the only company that has the ability to modify the triple tachometers, p/n 64100-003, to the upgraded  version, p/n 64100-003 Rev A, to mitigate this newly discovered problem.  This upgrade will consist of a new needle stack up and associated internal changes as well as a new face plate to enhance pilot gauge scans. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Deliveries shall commence 5 months after contract award and shall continue at a rate of 50 units per month. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Public notice is given that the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an investigation of possible sites to be used for the construction of an office building in Ogden, Utah, USA.  As part of this investigation, GSA hereby solicits sites that may be donated to the United States of America, or sites offered with an assignable purchase option to the successful offeror of the subsequent design/build phase of the acquisition.

A minimum site area of approximately 1-2 acres is required in the delineated area within a 2,000 foot cable run of the current main telecommunications switch located at 2262 Wall Avenue, Ogden, UT.

The following criteria are being used to consider offered sites that satisfy the minimum requirements:  
	1-2 acres in size
	Security setback requirements of 50 feet 
	IRS voice and data connectivity must be within a 2,000 foot cable run of the current main switch located at 2262 Wall Avenue, Ogden, UT.
	Neighborhood attributes must in keeping with the nature and character of a campus-like setting.
	Compliance with local zoning and land use plans

Owners may submit their own proposals.  However, proposals submitted by agents must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the agents authority to make such offers from the legal site owner(s).  This is to advise those persons submitting offers that due to procedural regulations under certain laws, options should remain open through the anticipated lease award date in Spring 2009.  The Government will make every effort to expedite the site selection.

Owners of parcels aggregating less than the size of the site specified, but to which abutting parcels may be added to produce the size of the required site, are encouraged to offer such properties for inspection.  

Documentary evidence to be submitted for each site to be considered includes:
A plat of the proposed site indicating site context (adjacent uses); physical proximity to 2262 Wall Avenue, Ogden, UT; physical features; utilities; hydrology; topography; geotechnical conditions; existing improvements and buildings; vegetation and landscape; environmental hazards or considerations; public streets and alleys; easements; traffic accesses and related traffic patterns; site entry; proximity to public transportation;  etc.


This site acquisition is being conducted pursuant to statutory authority contained in 40 U.S.C. 3301-3315 (formerly Public Buildings Act of 1959, 40 U.S.C. 601-619).  Pursuant to this authority, GSA is authorized to conduct this site selection without regard to the competitive procurement procedures contained in Title III of the Federal Property Competition in Contracting Act.

In compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act and E.O. 13006, when operationally appropriate and economically prudent the government will consider historic buildings and sites within historic districts.  Demolition of historic buildings in anticipation of Government use may disqualify an offeror from consideration.  Additional information is available by visiting www.gsa.gov/historicpreservation

The Government will select the site deemed to be the most advantageous to the United States, all factors considered.  In order to ensure that the selected site is the most advantageous the Government may also consider any unique attributes or other nuances of a site deemed worthy of consideration, even if not listed in the advertisement.  The successful site offeror will be required to provide a Phase I Environmental Study, in accordance with National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).

None of the above-listed evaluation criteria is considered to be more important than any other.  However, as sites are evaluated, each sites unique attributes may result in one or more criteria becoming more important with respect to that particular site.

Offers should be received on or before October 6, 2008, and should be mailed to:

Small Business Utilization: Complexity and Extent of Small Business Utilization<BR><BR>d.	Cost<BR><BR>Contract Type:<BR>Any contract awarded will be a cost-plus-award-fee-type contract.<BR><BR>Organizational Conflict of Interest:<BR>It has been determined that the solicitation for the DMC mission will contain a detailed provision regarding Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) which will also be included in any resultant contract award.  A summary of the provision is outlined below: <BR><BR>a.  Definitions:  <BR><BR>Organizational Conflict of Interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.  Person as used herein includes corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and other business enterprises. <BR>	<BR>The term contractor as used, includes any person, firm, or corporation that has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor or in any parent corporation thereof, any person, firm, or corporation in or as to which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.  The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor, those of any corporation that has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor, and those of any corporation in which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.  All references to the contractor as contained shall apply with equal force to all of these included.<BR><BR>Contract shall be used as applicable to the level at which this clause is being invoked.<BR><BR>b.  Exclusions: <BR><BR>In order to prevent a future OCI resulting from potential bias, unfair competitive advantage, or impaired objectivity, the contractor awarded the DMC contract shall be subject to the following restrictions:<BR><BR>	(1) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract for which, in the course of performance of this contract, the contractor has received advance procurement information before such information has been made generally available to other persons or firms.<BR><BR>	(2) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract for which the contractor assists in the development of workload and budgetary information or determining or validating program requirements.<BR><BR>	(3) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for or award of any Government contract that calls for the evaluation of system requirements, system definitions, or other products developed by the contractor under this contract. <BR><BR>	(4) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract that requires the construction or fabrication of any system, equipment, hardware, and/or software for which the contractor participated in the development of requirements or definitions pursuant to this contract <BR><BR>    	(5)  The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract, that involves workload when the contractor has had the potential to influence or have advance knowledge of workload direction. <BR><BR>The exclusions contained in this clause shall apply for the duration of this contract and for three (3) years after completion and acceptance of all work performed hereunder.<BR><BR>If any provision of this clause excludes the contractor from competition for, or award of any contract, the contractor shall not be permitted to serve as a subcontractor, at any tier, on such contract. This clause shall be incorporated into any subcontract or consultant agreement awarded under this contract unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise.<BR><BR>c.  Compliance:  <BR><BR>Compliance with this OCI requirements is a material obligation of this contract.  The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law, including those set forth at FAR Part 9.5, or elsewhere included in this contract.  If the contractor takes any action prohibited by this requirement or fails to take action required by this requirement, the Government may terminate this contract for default.  For breach of any of the restrictions contained herein, or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, the Government reserves the right to terminate this contract for default, disqualify the contractor for subsequent related contractual efforts, and to pursue such other remedies as may be available under law.  If in compliance with this clause, the contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest subsequent to contract award, the Contracting Officer may choose to terminate this contract for convenience of the Government, when such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.<BR><BR>d.  Avoidance of OCI: <BR><BR>The policy of the government is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable organizational conflicts of interest.  <BR><BR>It is not the intention of the government to foreclose a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  The Contracting Officer must evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination of such action may be negotiated between the impaired vendor and the Contracting Officer.  <BR><BR>The Contracting Officers decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and the efficacy of any proposed mitigation shall be final.<BR><BR>e.	Mitigation Plans:  <BR><BR>The successful contractor will be required to permit a government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for verification purposes.  The government reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in the best interests of the government. Additionally, after award the government will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed, in the event of changes in the vendor community due to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest.<BR><BR>Contact Info:<BR>If after reviewing this synopsis, you are interested in this requirement, please send an email notice to melissa.light@us.army.mil stating your companys interest.<BR>Thank you.<BR>

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Field Acquisition Office in Grand Prairie, Texas has a requirement to provide electrical and thermal energy produced from renewable sources to assist the Federal Correctional Complex Allenwood, (hereinafter referred to as "FCC Allenwood"), in meeting the requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and to provide stable electrical and thermal energy costs for the Complex. The proposed Contractor is the County of Lycoming, Pennsylvania, (hereinafter referred to as "County"), which is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 1973, the County was granted a Use Permit from the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, (hereinafter referred to as "FBOP"), to utilize a part of the Allenwood Prison Complex land for a solid waste disposal site. The construction of a solid waste disposal facility was completed with the encouragement and support of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in order to serve an environmental need in a six county area in central Pennsylvania. The disposal facility became operational in 1978 and has been in continuous operation since that time with essentially no negative experience with respect to FBOP operations. The initial Use Permit was extended in 1998 for an additional 15 year period. The County now proposes to expand its ongoing relationship with FBOP by undertaking what is designated as the "Lycoming County Renewable Energy Project". In this project the County will design, construct, operate, and maintain a landfill methane gas fueled electric generation and thermal generation facility which will provide approximately 81% of the FCC Allenwood electric needs and approximately 96% of the thermal energy needs of the FCC Allenwood at known rates during the proposed 10 year contract period. These proposed rates for electrical and thermal energy are expected to provide stable, predictable energy costs for FCC Allenwood and are expected to save FCC Allenwood substantial dollars over the term of the Agreement. Energy use estimates are based on data supplied by FCC Allenwood. This sources sought synopsis is for the purpose of conducting market research to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Any resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract and shall have a performance period of 10 years. All information concerning this requirement will be distributed solely through the General Services Administrations Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov/. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The web site for registration is www.ccr.gov. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 562213 Solid Waste Combustors and Incinerators and the applicable small business standard is $11.5 million. Please ensure CCR registration includes the appropriate NAICS code. Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. Please submit a letter of interest, capability statements and evidence of state or local authority to provide renewable electric and thermal energy utilities by October 10, 2008.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Command, Joint ArmamentsContracting Center, Picatinny NJ is conducting a Sources Sought survey to locate potential sources who have a working knowledge of the "Enterprise Project Management Software" operation & function together with the IMPRESS  integration software. A detailed knowledge of SAP Interface protocols and tools is also required. 
This  proposed contracting effort plays a key strategic role for the Project Integration Office (PIO) as ARDEC continues its move toward best business practices and the implementation of Project Management Institute (PMI) standards for project management at ARDEC.  The PIO needs outside industry expertise in Project Management and Project Scheduling to ensure the organization's long term operational success.  The contractor must have a working knowledge of implementing and maintaining an Enterprise Project Management system.  ARDECs EPM implementation requires the contractor to have technical ability to configure, develop and maintain Enterprise Microsoft Project 2003, IMPRESS integration software and knowledge of SAP interface protocols. The linking of these tools integrates industry proven project management best practices and enables the ARDEC Enterprise to effectively plan both their human capital and other resources against the project schedules, establish project baselines and integrate execution data.   This enables ARDEC's project managers to quickly react to shifting project needs and see the impact those changes may have on other projects being executed within the ARDEC Enterprise, as well as enable the deployment of standard cost/schedule/performance reporting for all projects within the Enterprise to both ARDEC management and our customers.
Interested sources capable of supplying this type of service are requested to submit their company's name, address, size of business (small or large), Point of contact, telephone number, via E-Mail to david.pisano1@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>Description of the Requirement:  The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking to purchase a local traffic server from Dell, along with a license upgrade and related services to support the Future Digital System (FDSys).</p>
<p>GPO has already purchased a load balancer from Dell for use in a Test environment at a reduced rate.  In order to use this same equipment in a Production environment, it can be upgraded via a licensing fee through the original seller.  In order to meet the Production Department's needs GPO must still purchase an additional full-price load balancer and necessary services.</p>
<p>In addition, this hardware is purchased in order to match the current infrastructure standards being used within the GPO infrastructure.  GPO has also standardized on specific equipment for the Test environment.  In order to minimize the differences between the Test and Production systems, GPO must purchase similar equipment for the Production environment.</p>
<p>Impact on government:  GPO is under very strict time restraints to have this work done.  Any major deviation from the test environment could cost the government unnecessary time and money due to an additional troubleshooting phase.  Therefore it is recommended that Dell be awarded a sole source contract to perform this requirement to ensure that GPO will successfully complete this upgrade.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All parties interested may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. See Note 22.</p>

Lastly, a recompete would result in duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competition.  1099 Pro Enterprise/W2 Pro software is the only software capable of meeting the Agencys needs.  1099 Pro/W2 Pro is capable of handling over 1 million transactions and DFAS currently has 250K 1099 transactions and 130K W2 transactions.  They are the only vendor that has the capability to systemically generate an IRS W-9 it to a contractor/vendor and track and monitor the responses.  They are the only vendor that has a systemic process to prepare a file that can be sent to the IRS for TIN matching.  They offer an automated IRS form 941 and the ability to prepare W2cs, Cancelled Debt corrections.  Their software program also has operational capabilities that are easier to use and navigate than other vendors.  They have an online tutorial and documented procedure manuals.  They have a service bureau that can provide immediate assistance to the user of the software at no additional cost.  They, upon request, will make modifications to the program to meet an explicit need to ensure data is captured, sorted, and processed accurately and timely. Additionally, because of this on-going effort a base year and two options have been recommended.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source commercial firm-fixed-price acquisition to Strategic Analysis, Inc. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (DSB).
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The NAICS for this requirement is proposed as 541611.
The DSB is tasked to conduct studies and reviews of a myriad of DoD issues and activities and has been tasked with preparing reports on the applicability of the Biological Surety Program and requires expert administrative, organizational and researching capabilities.  The contractor shall prepare a technical and analytical report of previous research done on the subject of developments in biotechnology and attempt to project transition paths from research into current and future defense applications. The contractor shall facilitate meetings of the DSB Task Force, prepare a plan of action, and create milestones with a calendar of events.  The contractor shall provide administrative support, provide and maintain security clearance information and facilities for the Task Force, as well as prepare briefings and a final report detailing the findings of the DSB Task Force.  Security requirements and time are also factors for consideration.  The contractor will be required to readily have access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) should it be required for the completion of this requirement. The contractor personnel shall have Defense Security Service issued clearances appropriate to their duties while performing the duties required under this contract.  On an intermittent basis, some support may require a Top Secret/SCI clearance but the majority of work will be at Secret and below.  The report due date is December 1, 2008.

Strategic Analysis, Inc. personnel already have the required level of clearance, detailed knowledge of DSB operations, and are familiar with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the legal framework under which the DSB operates.  The period of performance for this effort is from the date of award to December 1, 2008.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit capabilities to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Gregory Ruderman or the Contract Specialist, MS.

Justification for Sole Source:  The Microsoft Campus Agreement is a 3-year program through Microsoft and its resellers that allows accredited academic institutions to take advantage of academic pricing. This Agreement is an annual subscription with Software Assurance that provides DINFOS with product upgrades as they are released for the 3 year life of the Agreement.  This agreement includes all Microsoft products currently in use at DINFOS.  This includes MS Windows Server, Windows XP and Vista, MS Project, MS Visio, MS SQL, MS Exchange, MS Office, and applicable client access licenses.  MS Campus Agreement provides DINFOS with a vehicle for purchasing multi-volume licenses for all Microsoft applications currently used and taught in the school.  The products include server and workstation operating systems, desktop applications, and development and database applications.  All staff and student workstations currently utilize Microsoft products for daily activities.  DINFOS currently owns a number of software packages used by staff and students for training.  This service is vital to the mission of DINFOS.  This proprietary, vendor-specific hardware/software is currently in operational use at DINFOS.  This is a 3-year lease agreement renewable yearly with CDW-G that was awarded the contract FY2005 through competitive acquisition.  The process to initially establish the paperwork baseline required by Microsoft for this service was extensive.  The current documentation required by Microsoft to remain in the program resides with CDW-G.

This announcement constitutes the only notice; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all quotes received by the closing date specified in this notice.

	(a) Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

	(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

	(2) A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

	(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

	(2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 651699 and the business size standard is $7.0 Million. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) from Gene Dx, Inc., 207 Perry Parkway, Gaithersburg, MD 20877 for the following as outlined in the statement of work:

Background: The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) was established to serve as a hub where development of technology for the rapid isolation and analysis of disease genes will be carried out.  The DIRs basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct research in medical genetics.  Research includes identifying and understanding the molecular basis of human genetic disease and planning and carrying out clinical trials to test methods for the treatment. The mission of the DIR includes the training of physicians and doctoral degree fellows in medical genetics through the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program.  The Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program is administered by the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) and is accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics (ABMG).

Requirements for board certification of competency of our trainees includes laboratory experiences in molecular genetics.  To meet these requirements the Medical Genetics Branch and OCD seek nearby institutions to provide these components of training for board certification in Clinical Genetics, Ph.D. Medical Genetics, Clinical Molecular Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics.  This institution or group of institutions must also provide the opportunity for trainees in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Ph.D. Medical Genetics, to see patients with genetic disorders under the direction of an ABMG board certified geneticist.  The laboratory experience of the trainees must include a wide array of molecular diagnostic testing in the fields of neurodegenerative disorders, late onset disorders, imprinting disorders, mental retardation, neuromuscular disorders, and metabolic diseases, including prenatal diagnosis.  
The laboratory aspect of the training program will need to be conducted in molecular diagnostic laboratories with equipment and personnel to provide the hands-on experience required for board certification by ABMB. The staff, which must include ABMG board certified laboratory directors, will be required to train fellows in applicable laboratory techniques and the clinical interpretation and implications of the test results. The staff must also participate in the comprehensive teaching of fellows; including participation in lecture series, journal clubs, and case conferences.  The cost of disposable supplies used by trainees will be included in the contract. 

This project is required for NHGRI/DIR to help provide the DIR with access to CLIA/CAO and ABMG approved settings to train fellows in the laboratory techniques of molecular genetics for the diagnosis of genetic disorders and the genetic implications of these test results.
The purpose of this contract is to maintain formal training program sites for the instruction of medical and doctoral fellows as part of the requirements for board certification in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Cytogenetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Clinical Molecular Genetics. 

The goals of the program are to:
1.	Provide a training facility that will conduct one-month training experience in molecular diagnostics for each of our Clinical Genetics, Clinical Cytogenetics, and Clinical Biochemical Genetics trainees.

Statement of Work  USCG Aviation Training Requirements

1.  Scope of Work:  This Statement of Work describes the vessel and personnel required to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, PR.  The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard's aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting operations.

2.  Background:  One of the Coast Guard's primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment and rescue swimmers to/from underway vessels and to/from the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews.  This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guard's increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.

3.  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 34 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 10 foot beam. The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet. Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 8 tons.

       a.  Other Characteristics:  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or "dead in the water".  The vessel must have the endurance to maintain 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of +/-10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g., antennas).

      b.  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 58 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

      c.Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Borinquen Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

      d.Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

      e.Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a 45 minute transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

      f.Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer's technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and/or local regulations. 
 

4. Personnel:  All contractor personnel are required to be U. S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.

      a.  Point of Contact:  The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time.  The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

      b.  Crew:  Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands.  The crew shall be currently trained in rescue techniques and water survival.  Each of the crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and any required rescue operations.

      c.  Coxswain:  The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.

      d.  Deckhands:  The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

5.  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:

      a.  Normal Schedule:  Typically the contractor will be required to provide services one day per week (usually on Monday).  Operations will typically be conducted for on scene periods of 3 hours commencing 1-2 hours prior to official sunset.  The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  Additional training periods may be conducted more than once a week to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

      b.  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be from Latitude 18-15.00N to 18-30.00N from the shoreline out to longitude 067-25.00W.  

      c.  Operational Log:  The contractor shall maintain a log of all operations, which includes dates, location, times, duration and type of evolutions being performed.  The log shall be passed to Air Station Borinquen COTR on a monthly basis within 5 days of the end of the month.

      d.  Communications during Operations:  The contractor shall ensure that the vessel contacts Air Station Borinquens operations watch stander at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes while engaged in aviation training services.

      e.  Weather Criteria:  The Vessel must be capable of completing training requirements in sea states of up to 6 feet and wind speeds of up to 30 knots.

      f.  Functions / Tasks:  The contractor shall support training operations for the hoisting and/or delivery of equipment from government aircraft.  These objects may be delivered directly to the contract vessel or dropped into the water for retrieval.  The contractor shall also serve as an on scene search and rescue and rescue asset during helicopter rescue swimmer deployment evolutions and helicopter approaches to the water.  The training to be conducted will be both initial for new aviators/aircrews and proficiency maintenance for experienced aviators/aircrews.

6. Performance Evaluation Meetings:  The contractor's project manager shall meet at least monthly with the Contracting Officer or COTR during the first two months of the contract to discuss performance problems and review contractor corrective actions.  The operational log will also be used to verify the contractor's timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a monetary deduction in the charter hire.  Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR.

7.  Communication Procedures:  The government shall provide/assign VHF communication frequencies for contractor use.  The contractor shall provide a cell phone on board for secondary communications with the Air Station Borinquen Operations Center. 

8.  Orientation Briefing & Training:  The government shall provide an orientation brief and initial training for key contract personnel prior to the contract start date.  The orientation and training will include at a minimum safe boating practices, vessel hoisting operations, rescue swimmer operations, dewatering pump delivery operations, etc.  The government shall also provide semi-annual refresher training on the same items.

9.  Invoicing for Service:  A set payment will be established for a standard training block.  The payment will be the same regardless of whether the Coast Guard actually uses the full scheduled time.  The standard training block will include three hours of contract vessel on scene time, not including transit time to/from the training site from the contractor's mooring/docking location.  Scheduled unused training time may be banked by the Air Station and added onto any future training block.  No training block shall exceed six hours.  Unused training time may not be used to set up a separate trip.  Any unused training time at the end of the contract will be forfeited and the Government will retain any unused funds. (Reference FAR 12.403 (d), Termination for the Governments Convenience.) 

10.  Insurance:  Contractor is responsible for ensuring they have adequate liability insurance coverage under FAR 28.306(a-2).

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

1752.224-70  Protecting Personally Identifiable Information		   	

	(a) Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

	(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

	(2) A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

	(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

	(2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions.

For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html.(b) The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of NetApp Disk Drives.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The NetApp equipment is to expand the current environment.  NetApp equipment is preloadad with proprietary software which enables them to work in the SAN environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

Background: The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) was established to serve as a hub where development of technology for the rapid isolation and analysis of disease genes will be carried out.  The DIRs basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct research in medical genetics.  Research includes identifying and understanding the molecular basis of human genetic disease and planning and carrying out clinical trials to test methods for the treatment. The mission of the DIR includes the training of physicians and doctoral degree fellows in medical genetics through the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program.  The Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program is administered by the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) and is accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics (ABMG).

Requirements for board certification of competency of our trainees includes laboratory experiences in molecular genetics.  To meet these requirements the Medical Genetics Branch and OCD seek nearby institutions to provide these components of training for board certification in Clinical Genetics, Ph.D. Medical Genetics, Clinical Molecular Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics.  This institution or group of institutions must also provide the opportunity for trainees in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Ph.D. Medical Genetics, to see patients with genetic disorders under the direction of an ABMG board certified geneticist.  The laboratory experience of the trainees must include a wide array of molecular diagnostic testing in the fields of neurodegenerative disorders, late onset disorders, imprinting disorders, mental retardation, neuromuscular disorders, and metabolic diseases, including prenatal diagnosis.  
The laboratory aspect of the training program will need to be conducted in molecular diagnostic laboratories with equipment and personnel to provide the hands-on experience required for board certification by ABMB. The staff, which must include ABMG board certified laboratory directors, will be required to train fellows in applicable laboratory techniques and the clinical interpretation and implications of the test results. The staff must also participate in the comprehensive teaching of fellows; including participation in lecture series, journal clubs, and case conferences.

<DESC>The FCC seeks grass roots organizations and community-based organizations to help educate consumers, assist with converter box procurement and installation, establish and staff help centers, and conduct post-deadline assistance.  Based on the experience of other countries that have gone through the transition, it appears that a large amount of activity takes place two to four weeks before the transition deadline and then two weeks after the deadline.  Therefore, planning with grass roots organizations and community-based organizations through March 2009 is extremely important.

Specific actions to achieve the objectives may include any one or combination of the following key tasks:


	Procurement of DTV Converter Boxes.  Assistance to consumers in obtaining DTV converter boxes and related equipment from retailers (this contract does not provide for the cost of converter boxes or related equipment).  

	Installation of Converter Boxes.  Assistance to consumers with the installation of the converter boxes and related equipment.

	Establishment of Help Centers.  Establishment of help centers for consumers seeking information regarding the DTV transition and related equipment issues.



Post-DTV Transition Deadline Assistance.  Assistance to consumers beyond the termination of full power analog broadcasting on February 17, 2008, including technical assistance regarding converter box operations. 
Outreach to Identified Target Television Markets.  Outreach to Areas Identified in the FCCs Nationwide Initiative Targeting 81 Cities and Puerto Rico.  Grass roots and community-based organizations may propose to conduct outreach, install converter boxes, establish help centers and conduct post-DTV deadline assistance in any one, combination of or all of the cities included in the FCCs Nationwide Initiative for DTV Outreach announced on August 18, 2008.  Details on this August 18 announcement and the list of 81 cities can be found at www.dtv.gov or 
http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-284629A1.pdf.

In addition to the key tasks under this contract, the organizations must have the ability to:

	Obtain full and complete knowledge of:
o	The FCCs and NTIAs educational materials 
o	The FCCs www.dtv.gov website
o	NTIAs website www.DTV2009.gov
	Ensure appropriate messaging throughout the outreach campaign.
	Provide the necessary resources to meet the task requirements.
	Maintain full technical coordination and interchange of information with FCC program management team.
	Provide real time access to program status and performance.
	Meet program objectives while providing innovative and flexible management of project cost, schedule, performance, risks, and subcontracts.
	If sub-contracting is to be utilized, it shall be done through effective teaming arrangements.
	Provide feedback on and demonstration of success of outreach effort. 

See attached Statement of Objectives (SOO).

The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to propsed questions and to extend the response close date to October 21, 2008 at 12:00 PM (EST).  See attached file listed as "Government Response to Vendor Questions."  Puerto Rico is now added to the Nationwide Initiative. Thus, respondendts to this RFQ are now required to provide services as described in the above objectives in Puerto Rico.

<DESC><p>MODIFICATION TO BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA):Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) is posting this modification to generate new concept White Paper submittals for funding consideration within realigned program objectives and mission priorities of the Technology Coordination Office (TCO). The modification also updates current Government POC?s. The total amount of funding for new project starts in FY08 and FY 09 is expected to be in the vicinity of $20M. White Papers will be accepted at any time; however, funding decisions are generally made prior to May 1 for the next fiscal year which commences October 1. To simplify the changes, this modification will incorporate the original base BAA and all changes into this modification and will supersede the original Combined Solicitation. BACKGROUND: The mission of the Technical Coordination Office is to rapidly develop and field Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and technical collection capabilities consistent with current mission priorities. Within this framework, TCO is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) collection technologies to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. TCO aims to be a premier provider of innovative MASINT and technical intelligence collection technologies as end-to-end systems able to respond to both tactical and strategic needs of the intelligence and war-fighter communities. AREAS OF INTEREST: In order for organizations to gain a clearer picture of TCO?s mission requirement priorities and the technologies proposed to meet these requirements it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Ms. Susan Engel. Her unclassified email address is susan.engel@patrick.af.mil. Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified by the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD). PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within the general MASINT scientific disciplines. TCO is seeking White Papers that offer demonstration of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of high interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest. Development of this technology into operationally useful systems requires a wide range of scientific, engineering and technical expertise combined with knowledge of current intelligence and military requirements, capabilities, and operations. Scientific disciplines considered components of MASINT include electro-optics, radar and radio frequency, trace materials sampling, nuclear radiation, geophysics. These disciplines are augmented with expertise for systems engineering/integration with manned and unmanned air/land/water/space based platforms, command, control and communications systems and processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) systems. For a developmental system to be successfully transitioned to real-world intelligence collection operations, it must be compatible with existing operational concepts/doctrine, processes, systems, logistical, environmental realities and force protection constraints. SCHEDULE: This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (1 Nov 04 - 1 Oct 08), and is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories. White Papers will be accepted at any time. This BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 1&nbsp;April 2009. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. WHITE PAPERS: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The White Paper should include the White Paper Cover Sheet (attachment 1), containing the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any. It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort. The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. The White Paper does not include a cost proposal. It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives. It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort. The White Paper must also include past performance data (attachment to 2-4 page white paper), in accordance with the attached instructions (attachment 2). White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note: White Papers already submitted under BAA-04-01-JT 1 or BAA-05-01-JT2, should not be resubmitted under this BAA modification. FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: The format for white papers follows below. White paper proposals that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task objective and relevant mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration. Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors. All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch. Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT security guide. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award. All white paper responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002. E-mailed white paper submissions are not accepted. E-mailed questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors, during the white paper proposal development phase of this acquisition, should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer and must reference the title and BAA-05-01-JT2 number. White Paper Transmittal Addresses: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925. White papers classified above the level of Secret must be directed to the Chief, Security Division, David Sorter, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, phone: 321-494-6701 EVALUATION CRITERIA: The evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-within classified mission areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications &amp; Capabilities. The Mission area managers will evaluate the offeror?s proposal for improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, the offeror?s knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&amp;D, and the offeror?s ability to rapidly respond to operational needs. (2) Relevant Past &amp; Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal that shall be considered. PROPOSALS: White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal. AWARDS: Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Nov 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA, from Nov 04 - Sep 09, is over $100 million. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. These offerors should immediately contact the contracting officer for information if they contemplate responding. Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government. NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personal (currently from ZelTech, MTC, and EWA) has signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as Government Access Only. Proposals labeled by the offerors as for ?Administrative Purposes Only? will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.

<DESC><p>Note: An attachment including the details of industry day will be available on 12 Jun 06. The 554 Electronic Systems Wing is pleased to announce an Industry Day Conference for the follow-on Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) contract on 19 Jun 06 at Hanscom AFB MA. GCSS-AF is an Electronic Systems Center initiative to meet total systems integration and operations for Operations Support net-centric infrastructure, although over time that infrastructure will blend or merge with C2ISR infrastructure. The GCSS-AF infrastructure will also support some Joint or other military service operations and over time enterprise services may be eliminated or merged or adopted from other military services or the DoD. Target focus is the continued operations of GCSS-AF infrastructure on the NIPRNET and SIPRNET, evolution of GCSS-AF's Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and continued high velocity delivery of infrastructure, data services, and fused, cross-functional war-fighter capabilities. Work will be accomplished as required at Hanscom AFB, MA; contractor facilities; DoD locations and facilities throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii and various facilities overseas. Temporary and extended overseas travel (more than thirty days) may be required.</p>

<DESC><p>**Amendment 001 is to add the attached Questions and Answers Documentation to help claify information in this Sources Sought Notice and extend the response date to 10-17-2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This notice is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Responses to this notice are strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. No entitlement of payment by the government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<br />Introduction: This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for an Operational Aviation Training Unit. The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) located at Brooks City-Base, Texas, trains 100% of the USAF's flight surgeons, Aerospace Medicine specialists and Aerospace Physiologists. Relocation of this mission to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio&nbsp;will enhance integration of the science, research and academic mission of USAFSAM, but will separate the organization from all likely sources of basic aviation training support. <br />Background:<br />The Aerospace Medicine specialists and Aerospace Physiologists receive their aviation training in the San Antonio area (Randolph AFB and/or Laughlin AFB). Current flying training for basic Aerospace Medicine Primary students is insufficient and "space available" only. No opportunity for basic or advanced flight familiarization training for Flight Surgeons, Resident Aerospace Medicine specialists or Aerospace Physiologists will be available at Wright-Patterson, AFB. The students will have to travel to other locations within the U.S. to receive their training, not only is this costly is not consistently available.<br />Descriptions of Services:<br />The government seeks a vendor to provide an "operational" aviation training unit in the Dayton, Ohio area during fiscal year 2010, but no later than 2011. Period of Performance will be for a period of no less than five (5) years. The vendor will offer curriculum-based aviation training on-site at Wright-Patterson&nbsp;AFB for Aerospace Medicine and Aerospace Physiology students and related staff, offer or assist with "ground school" lectures in a group setting, and provide a dedicated flying training unit that will permit student control with an instructor in all phases of flight. The flying demonstration and proficiency curriculum will be specifically designed to expose flight surgeon and aerospace physiology trainees to the rigors of flying, mission planning, modern cockpit symbology, disorientation, and instrument techniques and will ideally include capability for aerobatic flight. The curriculum would include spatial disorientation familiarization training and instrument training with an emphasis on human factors and disorientation awareness events, although there will not be a requirement for FAA private or instrument certification of trainees. This requirement is for a period of one year. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. You may contact Ms. Blanca E. Ruiz at the telephone number and email provided herein.<br />DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The Information package should include the following items:<br />1. A brief description of your company's business size and business status (ie. small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned, HUBzone, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI); <br />2. Do you qualify under the 8(a) program? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBzone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business or veteran-owned small business)?<br />2. What are your applicable NAICS codes?<br />3. Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of work? If not, why?<br />4. Do you have sufficient experience in the anticipated scope that would allow the evaluator to assess your capability? If not, please explain.<br />5. What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?<br />6. Are you aware of any DoD contracts dealing with commercial services for a "operational" aviation training unit?

<DESC>WPJ-08-0894  PERIMETER IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT, NEBRASKA AVENUE COMPLEX (NAC), 3801 NEBRASKA AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC  
 
CBD Notice posted on September 11, 2008 is hereby amended to change the solicitation issuance date from September 30, 2008 to October 15, 2008 and RFP due date from October 30, 2008 to November 17, 2008.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity to procure 
services of a highly qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for an overall security enhancement of both physical spaces and security equipment in and around the perimeter of a campus of federal office buildings which is located on a 38 acre complex in Northwest Washington, DC. This complex is commonly known as the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC).

GSA intents to award a firm-fixed price contract utilizing Source Selection procedures 
that represents the best value to the Government, as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.  Under this Source Selection, non-price factors are significantly more important than price.

This procurement is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Women-owned businesses are encouraged to submit bids and so state that they are women-owned.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) issuance date is October 15, 2008; and the RFP due  
date is November 17, 2008.   GSA is issuing this solicitation electronically and on CD-ROM.  You may access the RFP documents at the Federal Business Opportunity Website Home Page at http://www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov.  However, the construction project drawings will be available on CD-ROM only.  Potential offerors may pick-up a CD-ROM copy of the construction project drawings on October 15, 2008 at the General Services Administration, National Capital Region, Regional Office Building, Bid Room, Room 1065, 7th & D Streets, SW, Washington, DC.  Please reference Solicitation Number WPJ-08-0894 when requesting the bid documents and drawings. 

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur within 25 months after 
a notice to proceed (NTP). GSA is planning to award this contract in early 2009.

The estimated cost for the project is between $15,000,000 and $25,000,000 dollars.

This project will include major renovations and demolition of several buildings located at the NAC. There will also be construction of new guard booths, vehicle screening building, upgraded fencing and electronic security equipment used to monitor the site. This is a turnkey project.

Due to the substantial amount and complexity of electronic equipment required on the project it is expected that the Prime Contractor will have as a part of their team, a technology systems integrator, security specialist, AV and IT specialists. Some portions 
of the technology systems will be required to be certified by the Underwriters Laboratory (UL).  Therefore, appropriate parties of the team of technology subcontractors will be required to have applicable UL certifications.

Interested Offeror(s) must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size, or which has similar projects currently under construction.

Offeror(s), individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed price.  

While the contractors personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e. TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.

The RFP will require the proposals be submitted in a two volume set.  Volume I will be the Technical Proposal and Volume II will be the Pricing Proposal.  The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with the FAR Part 15.  The selection process will use tradeoffs.  Non-price factors are significantly more important than the price related factors.  The technical proposals evaluation (non-price) factors are as follows: Capabilities/Experience (33%), Past Performance (25%), Technical Approach (22%), and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation (20%).

Offerors will be required to address Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) considerations in 
the technical portion of their proposals.  Offerors shall provide a SDB Participation Plan that outlines their targets, expressed as dollars and percentage of the total contract value, in each 
of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subfactor, and a total target for SDB participation by contractor, including joint venture partnership, and team members, and a total for SDB participation by subcontractors.

YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFP AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  

THERE WILL BE NO PUBLIC BID OPENING.

<DESC>The reason for this Amendment to this Announcement is to attach the Description which was inadvertently left out of the Announcement.
The US Geological Survey negotiated on a sole source basis which has been awarded to Wendell Rahorst, Inc. a Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business, 2120 Lookout Mountain Rd, Golden, CO  80401 to provide a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) to perform an industrial hygiene assessment and assess USGS employee protection needs, on an existing/current Purchase Order 08CRSA0303 with four option years.  This procurement has been conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13, and FAR Part 19.1406 - Sole Source Awards to Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Concerns.
Background
There is impending heavy construction scheduled to take place on the western edge of the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, CO, to build a new hospital.  The construction is anticipated to commence in the spring of 2008.  The construction area, which used to be part of the DFC, has been annexed to the City of Lakewood (fig. 1).  This area has a history of former landfills which were once known to have contained asbestos and other hazardous materials.
Heavy construction can produce heavy dust, particle emissions, exhaust fumes, and other potential hazards to employees, the community, and the surroundings.  There are regulations, guidelines and site specific job requirements for dust and particle suppression which must be adhered to during construction.
In addition to the hospital construction, the General Services Administration is going to have an environmental remediation project taking place south of the hospital site in the southwest corner of the DFC.  This project involves asbestos abatement in the soils in this area.  The remediation project is scheduled to take place in 2008 (exact date unknown at this time).
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has concerns for the health and well being of their employees who are located in buildings on the west side of the DFC and directly adjacent to the construction and remediation sites (Buildings 810 and 95), and have the potential of exposure to construction dusts, particulates, and other emissions.  
Purpose
Contracting a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) is needed to perform an industrial hygiene assessment and assess USGS employee protection needs.  The contract shall be a Blanket Purchase Order with a qualified Industrial Hygiene company and shall be available on an "as-needed/on-call" basis. 
Qualifications:
1. The Contractor shall be certified by The American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH).2. The Contractor shall have previous experience with the type of work required including presentation skills.3. The Contractor shall be located in the Denver metro area.4. Field work could be conducted by a qualified field technician with supervision by the Contractor.5. All sampling shall adhere to National Institute o Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) methods.6. Prior to sampling, the laboratory shall be contacted to ensure that the approved methods will be used and that sampling method is compatible with the analytical methods.7. The Contractor shall be familiar with laws and regulations as they pertain to construction and remediation activities which should include, but are not limited to: a. EPA Clean Air Act (1990)b. Colorado Dept. of Public Health & the Environment, Regulation No. 3, Stationary Source Permitting and Air Pollutant Emission Notice Requirements
Description of Work
The industrial hygiene assessment of hazards should include the recommendation of abatement measures as it relates to the heavy construction if the existing control measures by the construction company are not adequate.  These control measures should reduce or eliminate potentially hazardous exposures to USGS employees and visitors who work in buildings adjacent to the construction area.  These results shall provide documentation of compliance and/or show the need for additional engineering controls as they relate to the heavy construction taking place.  The Contractor may need to: conduct indoor and outdoor monitoring of affected areas; present sampling results and interpretation of data to a variety of groups; attend meetings of parties involved with construction: the General Services Administration, USGS representatives, the general contractor, the City of Lakewood, and the Colorado Department of Public Health & the Environment.  The Contractor would have to participate in an initial "walk-through" of buildings and the surrounding environs for baseline purposes.  
Deliverables
1. Written industrial hygiene assessment reports to include sample analyses results, control measures recommendations, observations regarding regulatory compliance within the construction site and surrounding areas.2. Data reports.3. Oral presentations before representatives of the USGS management, safety office, general workforce.4. There should be a short response time to mobilize to the DFC dependent on the urgency (possibly within hours of the need).a. On-call for telephone consultation response within 1 hour contact by USGS (Mon.-Fri. 7 a.m.-5 p.m.)b. Report to DFC or construction site within 2-3 hrs. contact by USGS.c. Conduct sampling within 4-6 hrs. contact by USGS.
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<AWARDEE>Telemetry And Communication Systems, Edwards Air Force Base, Edwards, CA 93524 US
<DESC><p>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Directorate of Contracting, Edwards Air Force Base, and California intends to award a commercial order to Telemetry and Communication Systems Inc. This acquisition is for:
<p>The USAF Test Pilot School requires the refurbishment of the 8ft antenna system with a new ACU. Pedestal Interface Unit (PIU), camera tracking system and spare components by TCS.</p>
<p>The ACU specifications include:<br />*15' color touch screen<br />*1.8 GHz Pentium M processor<br />*512 MB RAM<br />*Windows XP Platform<br />*40 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW, 1.44Mb Floppy<br />*Ethernet (TCP/IP,UDP/IP), RS-232/422/485, and GPIB external interfaces<br />*ACU must interface with the PIU through fiber optic, multiconductor cable or USB<br />*Support conical scan feed, SCMP or E-scan<br />*Front panel USB interfaces<br />*Have the Edwards AFB Slaving System integrated into the ACU<br />*Form, fit and function to the existing antenna systems currently in use at USAF TPS, which is proprietary to TCS Inc.</p>
<p>TPS also requires a compact color CCD camera with sun shield and camera system to include monitor, video interface cables and mounting adapters in order to visually track takeoff and landing to prevent data loss due to TM dropouts. Camera tracking systems are standard on all Range antenna assets and critical for mission data quality . The camera must have &frac12;", .75mm, F1.8 on chip Microlens with audio iris, 32x zoom and no need for a control panel. The necessary power will be supplied from the pedestal and the video will be brought out via the slip ring assembly.</p>
<p>The 8 ft antenna system must be form, fit, and function to the existing antenna systems currently in use at the USAF TPS, which is proprietary to TCS, Inc. TPS is also requesting a Pedestal I/F PCB assembly and power supply with PCB assembly for the PIU to interface with the new antenna system to serve as spares for components that are critical to operation. The parts were deemed mission critical if they were to fail due to everyday usage.</p>
<p>This action will result in a purchase to support the USAF Test Pilot School. Telemetry and Communications Systems Inc. is the only source identified for procurement of this product. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334220 and the size standard is 750.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by AFFTC. The point of contact is Kay Delgado, AFFTC, Directorate of Contracting, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524. Responses are due by 3 Oct 08, 5 p.m. local Pacific Time via email. Her email address is Kathleen.delgado@edwards.af.mil</p>
<p>This NOTICE OF CONTRACTING ACTION (NOCA) is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.</p>

<DESC>Utility privatization is a joint Army and Defense Energy Support Center
(DESC) effort to privatize the water and wastewater utility infrastructure at Fort
Polk, Louisiana. Privatization is the total divestiture of a utility system through the
transfer and conveyance of the installation's utility infrastructure assets in
conjunction with and for the purpose of the conveyee providing utility
distribution services on a long-term basis. The successful conveyee assumes
ownership, operation, maintenance, and repair of the previously Government-owned
utility system infrastructure.

The privatization process includes: (1) the sale of the utility infrastructure; (2)
the acquisition of utility services on the privatized system(s); and (3) the
granting of an easement. The sale of the utility infrastructure is a property
disposal action, in accordance with 10 U.S.C.  2688, which is not covered

requirement for MSL and 2D symbols).  See the DLA packaging
web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change
notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply.  2D bar coding shall be
in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3)
and DoD 4500.9-R.  MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar

Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as
defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available
from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the field is
not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be
left blank.  If there are inconsistencies between the schedule

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
