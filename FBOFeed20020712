<DESC>NA NAICS Code: 541990.  The Volpe National Transportation Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Sensis Corporation, DeWitt, New York under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.   The Volpe Center is currently evaluating two new surveillance technologies, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) and Multilateration, that may improve surveillance in the offshore and high altitude areas in Gulf of Mexico and lead to a better understanding and optimization of the National Airspace System (NAS).   The Volpe Center identified the Sensis Corporation as the only source for an ADS-B and Multilateration type system that has been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) as part of the Airport Surface Detection Equipment – X (ASDE-X and has the unique capability to  operate with the Universal Access Transceiver data link.  In the offshore area of the Gulf of Mexico, surveillance coverage is limited due to over the water low trajectories for aircraft operators.   A network of surveillance ground stations and a central processing system have been implemented and its technical performance compared against existing secondary surveillance radar, Air Traffic Control Beacon Interrogator – 6 (ATCBI-6) is being evaluated.   The Volpe Center has a requirement to expand surveillance coverage of the ADS-B and multilateration technology with additional surveillance ground stations and processors in the Gulf of Mexico and to evaluate its technical performance against secondary surveillance radar.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Helicopter In-Fl ight Tracking System (NASA HITS) will be used to evaluate this technology for airborne targets both in the offshore and EnRoute areas, demonstrate it potential as a cost-effective flight following system for helicopters, and demonstrate its potential as an EnRoute surveillance system for the FAA.  The Sensis system is the only known system that can be acquired and implemented without requiring costly and time consuming modifications to the HITS communications protocols, data processing, and data algorithms.   The FAA has begun the implementation of multilateration and ADS-B as part of the ASDE-X system at twenty-five selected airports to provide surveillance coverage and Mode A identification information for all transpondered equipped aircraft on the airport surface.   NASA’s Dynamic Runwa y Occupancy Monitoring System (DROMS) currently collects surveillance, weather, and other pertinent aviation information and stores this information in a database for analysis.  With multilateration and ADS-B systems installed at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County (DTW) and Memphis International Airports (MEM), the Volpe Center will utilize DROMS to collect and analyze the surveillance and other pertinent aviation data.  Maintaining, optimizing, and debugging the current Multilateration and ADS-B ground surveillance infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and at DTW and MEM airports requires the experience and proprietary knowledge of the Sensis Corporation.  This is a notice for intent to award a sole source contract and is NOT a request for proposals. See Numbered Note 22.  The following not ice is provided for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate. For further information, call (800) 532-1169. Inter net address: http://osdbuweb.dot.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source contract to Foster Miller, Inc. of Waltham MA for the continued development and support of crawling autonomous vehicles. It is anticipated (based on the results of testing in Spring 03), that CSS will desire to utilize these same vehicles to support autonomous mine neutralization in the Surf Zone (SZ) and Very Shallow Water (VSW) area.  The follow-on neutralization effort will be included as optional tasks in the contract. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: 1). This is a follow-on effort to contract N61331-02-C-0022, with Foster Miller, for the continued development of a highly specialized system within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Award to any other source would result in a substanti al duplication of cost to the Government that could not feasibly be recovered through competition.  2). The SEA Talon autonomous vehicle is based on a design developed by FMI and there is no adequate description of the vehicle design that would allow a competitor to continue development.  3). The purpose of this requirement is to continue the development of the SEA TALON capabilities, integrate different sensor packages on the vehicle, and demonstrate the ability of the vehicle to perform lane reconnaissance and RIN missions in the real world environment. Only Foster Miller, Inc as the incumbent on contract N61331-99-C-0022 has the in-depth knowledge of the vehicle design to successfully accomplish this requirement.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541330.

Market research indicates that Lemoine Marine Refrigeration is the only manufacturer that can provide commercial, off-the-shelf items that can be installed without extensive modifications to the ships mechanical and electrical structures.  Lemoine marine Refrigeration maintains all proprietary rights to all technical and engineering data required to manufacture these items; therefore no additional information is available.

The model will be used to help meet Reclamation obligations related to Action 149 of the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative of the Biological Opinion on Operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service in December, 2000. IDWR, an agency of the State of Idaho, has staff in its Regional Office in Boise and field office in Salmon that will actively contribute to development and use of the model. The IDWR is the primary source in the State of Idaho for Geographic Information System and other digital land use, irrigation system, crop type, water use, water right, climate, soil, and other associated data that will be needed to configure the model. IDWR currently plans to use IDWR resources to develop a model to address water management issues in the basin. Reclamation endeavors to collaborate with IDWR by contributing Reclamation resources to a unified effort.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541360 and the size standard is $4.0 million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal  for Liquid Propellant Based Combustion Ignition System.  The proposed research/test program seeks to identify and demonstrate techniques for conditioning liquid hydrocarbon fuels, JP-7 or RP-1, such that they will sustain a robust detonation, thereby enabling operation of the ignition system with  the same propellants used in a multiple thrust chamber system; the liquid oxidizer, LOX, will also need to be gasified prior to ignition. Once this capability has been successfully demonstrated in a laboratory environment, CWI hardware will be  designed and built in order to demonstrate repeatable ignition in an actual liquid oxidizer/liquid hydrocarbon (LHC) fueled rocket thrust chamber.       I. Feasibility Study       Perform a feasibility study to characterize the technical challenges involved in developing a LOX/liquid hydrocarbon      fueled CWI. This will include, but is not limited to, characterizing the products of catalytically decomposed JP-7 or RP-1, investigating chemical kinetic limitations based on operation with the catalytically decomposed gases, determining the  relative merits of requiring a catalyzed fuel as opposed to fine mist atomization to enable a sustained detonation, and   identification of any concerns regarding integration of the CWI into a liquid rocket engine (LRE), such as maximum tube  length, minimum diameter, and maximum number of thrusters serviceable per initiation (premixing) chamber. The study  should assess both RP-1 and JP-7 as candidate fuels and identify any potentially insurmountable challenges.       II. LCWI Concept Demonstration       Design and fabricate a CWI chamber to demonstrate detonation of the expected LHC decomposition products,  identified in Part 1, with oxygen. The CWI system should initiate combustion with a spark (baseline). 3. Perform testing  of the CWI chamber using GOX and the fuel decomposition products identified in Part 1. Tests will be run at varying  levels of Pc and MR. Wave speed, premixer pressure and temperature, and induction length (distance required to transition from deflagration to detonation) will be measured.       III. Catalytic Decomposition Investigation       Determine if an existing catalytic chamber can be used in quantitative/qualitative assessment of the LHC decomposition  products. If so, and if financially feasible, this approach should be pursued for the "cracking" study. If no facility is    available, or if use of the system is not financially feasible or would not enable the program to meet schedule, fabricate a   workhorse catalytic heat exchanger to perform the LHC decomposition study. The catalytic reactor tube should allow f    adequate temperature control in order to simulate hot gas generator heating of the catalyst bed. 5. Analyze the     constituents of heated & catalyzed LHC fuel for species composition and associated mass fractions.       IV. Flight-Weight Conceptual Design       Generate a conceptual design for a flight-weight LCWI system, including estimates of weight, volume, and energy  required. Requirements will be supplied by the COTR.       Deliverables       The following deliverables will be required:       · Monthly status reports       · Drawings and operating conditions of actual CWI test hardware       · Conceptual design of a  flight-like LCWI system · Final report and suggestions for follow-on investigations  Breakdown of cost should be as follows: (1) Feasibility Study, (2) Concept Demonstration,(3) Catalytic Decomposition Investigation, (4) Flight-Weight Conceptual Design.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Network Systems Division, Telecommunications Systems Administration Branch (AQSS21) intends to issue a sole source contract to DynCorp Information Systems LLC, 15000 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA  20151-3808.  This acquisition provides the continuity of the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) operations; continued design, development and implementation of Wireless Priority Service (WPS) enhancements; and initial design, development and implementation of new or modified GETS features and WPS enhancements as inter-exchange carrier (IXC), local exchange carrier (LEC) and wireless carrier networks evolve with deployment of next generation network (NGN) and third generation (3G) equipment.  GETS, along with its WPS enhancements, is a major National Communications Systems (NCS) program for the improvement of National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications.  GETS provides NS/EP users with dependable, flexible and secure (when required) nationwide switched voice and voice-band data communications using the existing features of the Public Switched Network (PSN) with selected NS/EP enhancements.  GETS provides NS/EP users with routing alternatives and priorities not available to normal PSN traffic.  GETS is accessible from virtually anywhere in the United States (the 50 United States and the District of Columbia), is capable of using all major local exchange carrier (LEC) facilities, inter-exchange carrier (IXC) facilities, wireless carrier facilities, and selected Government networks (e.g., Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and the Federal Telecommunications System 2001 (FTS2001)), and provides the capability for international access and egress.  The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 underscored the growing reliance of NS/EP personnel upon cellular communications for critical national security and emergency preparedness operations.  Severe congestion in the wireless networks impacted the ability of critical NS/EP personnel to use cellular communications to coordinate their missions.  WPS enhancements will allow authorized priority users to gain access to the next available open channel before subscribers who are not engaged in NS/EP functions.  WPS calls will not preempt calls in progress, nor will WPS guarantee the completion of the priority call.  The resultant contract will be a 60-month (two-year base period plus three (3) one-year option periods) cost plus fixed-fee type contract.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  DITCO will issue Request for Proposal (RFP) DCA200-02-R-5014 on or about 30 August 2002.  The RFP will be posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.ditco.disa.mil under "Contracting Opportunities" under "Information Technology RFP/RFQ/RFI" of the DITCO Homepage. ALL inquiries regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically and directed to John M. Herrmann, Contracting Officer, at herrmanj@scott.disa.mil.  Estimated date of award is 06 July 2003.  All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole source contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 513310, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, will be used for determining company size status. See Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is contemplating award of a sole source contract to Indiana Ordnance Works, 11452 Highway 62, Charlestown, IN 47111, to update  existing and procure additional full-scale and reduced-scale models that  contain sectioned M231 and M232 charges.  The 155mm M231/M232 propelling  charges known and MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System) are two different  propelling charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a  complete zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of  a basic increment.  During development and fielding of the MACS charge, the  U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale  displays and reduced-scale models of the MACS to illustrate charge  construction, packaging and field application.  Improvement of the MACS charge  over time has resulted invarious displays and models becoming outdated.   Updating displays and models will regain their usefulness in exhibition and  training applications.  In addition to the displays and models requiring  modification, certain new displays are needed for special applications.  The  M231 charges are used at lower zones (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are   used at higher zones (Zones 3 thru 6). The models include renovating or  producing Zoning Solution displays, that contain 1/3 scale charge models  displayed on a wooden platform that demonstrate the different zones of the M231  and M232 charge.  Desktop training displays (Full scale cutaway) show the  interior of each charge and labeling of respective components.  The M231 and  M232 Packaged Cutaways are displayed in their metal ammunition storage  container.  The lighted inert display cases contain the MACS full-scale  cutaways and the 1/3 scale Presentation Sets that show each charge on a small  wooden platform.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical  Technpologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996.  Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by  the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to DoD  Directives 5230.24 and 5230.25.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the University of Texas/MD Anderson Cancer Center, under contract No. N01-CN-95040, to increase the number of patients to be randomized to a Phase II Chemoprevention Trial in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (FAP) Patients?Workstatement No. 65.  The Trial objectives are to determine the relative efficacy and tolerability of two ?active? chemopreventive regimens (e.g., celecoxib + eflornithine vs. celecoxib alone) in colorectal and duodenal cancer risk modulation of FAP patients who have a high risk for cancer in these organs due to a rare inborn mutation in a key tumor suppressor gene. The effects of the drugs will be evaluated by assessing colorectal and duodenal adenoma burdens with regard to several key parameters ? adenoma number, size, histopathologic grade, area of involvement, and global endoscopic assessments ? before and after a six month period of drug administration. In addition, the cellular and molecular effects of the treatment will be evaluated by measurement of a panel of tissue-based biomarkers chosen to reflect: 1) the biochemical effects of the drugs within the target organs of interest (e.g., eicosanoids, ornithine decarboxylase metabolites) and, 2) their downstream effects on potential surrogates of chemopreventive efficacy (e.g., in vivo ACF, proliferation, apoptosis). Data arising from the study will improve our mechanistic insights into the development of cancer in these patients and thereby facilitate future agent identification and development for cancer prevention.  Patients are currently being randomized to this trial, however, additional patients are needed to improve the power of the trial to identify important clinical benefits and risks associated with the treatment.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items. This  announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested  and a written solicitation will not be issued.  RFP #DAAE30-02-R-0825.  The  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in  effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (01-07).  The US Army ARDEC,  Picatinny Arsenal has the following requirement:  Scope/Program Objective:  The contractor shall provide a solvent vapor recovery system for mixers.  The  explosion proof vapor recovery unit will be use for the removal of solvents  contaminated with energetic materials as a result of processing Nitrocellulose  based gun propellants.  The vapor recovery unit shall be able to handle a  variety of solvents in air with normal humidity levels. The solvents shall  include in this design Ethyl Acetate, Ethanol, Acetone, and Diethyl Ether.   As part of the U.S. Army’s research and development activities, Picatinny  Arsenal operates three batch mixers used for the small-scale production of  propellants.  Dry and liquid (solvent) components are combined in the mixers.   The liquid portion is stripped until an extrudable product remains.  Solvents  are stripped by passing an air stream over the propellant mix.  The effluent  air stream (air/solvents) from the mixer will pass through a condenser and the  solvents will be condensed and collected for disposal by using the vapor  recovery unit.  Full-scale operation of the mixers in Building 1408 results in  solvent vapor effluents in excess of New Jersey limits.  The proposed system  should capture the vapor effluents and put the mixers in compliance with the  New Jersey effluent limits.   PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: The system shall be  capable of condensing solvent vapors from a solvent vapor/nitrogen stream by  chilling the vapors in a condenser with a cold refrigerant medium.   Compression of the vapors will not be allowed because of the inherent hazards  associated with compression of the explosive mixture.  The system shall be  equipped with a Class I, Groups C and D, Division I, explosion proof exhaust  fan capable of moving 15 SCFM of purging nitrogen plus each of the following  solvent effluents a distance of 61 feet from the source to the condenser.  The  solvents to be condensed vary from a heavy concentration early in the 30  minute cycle to a light concentration later in the 30 minute cycle.   Additional information on the vapor emission are shown below.  The three  solvent vapor streams individually are as follows: Diethyl ether/ethanol solvent vapor effluent from mixer 96.5% recovery required ELAPSED TIME(Minutes) 	0-10	10-20	20-30	Total at 30n minutes ETHER( LBS) 	19.90	13.26	6.63	39.79 ETHANOL	10.68	7.12	3.56	21.36 TOTAL	30.58	20.38	10.19	61.15 Ethyl/Ethanol Solvent Vapor Effluent from Mixer 96.5% recovery required ELAPSED TIME (Minute)	0-10	10-20	20-30	Total at 30 minutes Ether (lbs)	12	8	4	24 Ethanol	3	2	1	6 Total	15	10	5	30 Acetone/Ethanol solvent vapor effluent from mixer 96.5% recovery required ELAPSED TIME(Minutes)	0-10	10-20	20-30	Total at 30 minutes ACETONE (LBS)	7.56	5.03	2.25	15.11 Ethanol(LBS)	11.34	7.57	3.78	22.69 TOTAL	18.90	12.60	6.30	37.80  The vapor recovery system shall be capable of cooling the vapor streams to –50  degrees Fahrenheit and must recover 96.5% of the solvent vapors.  The vapor  condenser shall be capable of collecting all of the condensed liquid.  The  discharge of the condenser shall be at least 16 inches above the base of the  system to allow for drainage by gravity into a container.  The heat exchanger  must be designed to prevent reduction in optimum system condensing capacity  resulting from vapor flow reductions caused by frost accumulations.  The vapor  recovery system is to be electrically operated.  All electrical system shall  meet Class I, Group D, Division I, environmental requirements.  The vapor  recovery system shall be completely packaged and skid mounted.  It shall be  designed for location outdoors, must be air cooled, and automatically  operated.  The system shall be mounted in a walk-in weatherproof enclosure.   All controls are to be located within enclosure.  The following system  interface connections are to be supplied: flanged vapor inlet and outlet,  single point power connections, common fault alarm dry contacts and red light  to signal unplanned system shutdowns, condensate drain valve connection, vapor  condenser outlet temperature dry contacts and red light to signal temperature  rise on vapor discharge.  The explosion proof exhaust fan to pull vapors from  the source shall be located on the condenser.  The exhaust fan blades must be  of a non-ferrous metal.  The system shall be capable of operating from the 460  volts, 3 phase, 60-hertz and 115 volts, 1 phase 60n hertz power sources  available.  The package system shall not exceed a dimensional envelope of 14  feet long x 7 feet wide x 10 feet high. Contractor shall prepare and submit  engineering drawings. Three copies of an operating and maintenance commercial  manual.  Specifications on duct or pipe required to convey vapors from the  50- gallon mixer to condenser.  Contractor shall submit engineering drawings  and installation.  The contractor shall warrant the system for defects in  workmanship and materials for one year from the date of start-up.  Two days  of start-up and training service shall be provided after ARDEC installs the  equipment.  Installation will be accomplished not more than one year after  delivery to ARDEC.  The quoted price shall include shipment to ARDEC.  ARDEC  will provide the required mounting slab, will unload the unit and place it on  the mounting slab, will provide all the required electrical utilities and will  install all required vapor ducts.  If interested in submitting a proposal,  please contact for special requirements.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Lowest price  technically acceptable.  Proposals are due by 1600 hours, August 1, 2002 and  can be sent by facsimile, electronic mail or mailed to US Army TACOM/ARDEC,  AMSTA-AQ-APH, Bldg. 9, Attn: Kathy Hansen, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000.

<CONTACT>Sheila L. Spring Contract Specialist 3045356239     sheila_spring@nps.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; technical and price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-08.  This solicitation is under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Small Business-Small Purchase Set-Aside.  This acquisition is a total small business set-aside.  Responses are due on or before August 6, 2002.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314912 (Tents made from purchased fabrics) and the related small business size standard is 500 employees.  The National Park Service, Harpers Ferry Center has an initial requirement for two, 8-sided tents using flame resistant, laminated vinyl fabric (Sunbrella Firesist #9646 Canvas or equal) with an option for five additional tents during the life of this five year IDIQ contract. This will be a traveling exhibit in tents to commemorate the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  The exhibit tents will be set up primarily in parking lots around the country and moved approximately every two to three weeks.  They will be on the road from January 2003 until the summer of 2006 with breaks during the winter months.  The exhibit will consist of large photo mural graphics to be digitally reproduced.  These graphics will deal with the expedition, the land at the time of the expedition, and the major portion of the exhibit will deal with the American Indian population at that time.    The initial tents must be provided and set-up in Virginia on or before November 1, 2002 as follows: One tent will be approximately 20' in diameter, with the highest point of the roof point being 17' above the ground.  The second tent will be approximately 35' in diameter, with its highest roof point being 22' above the  tents.  These tent roofs will have a 2' valance ascending from the eave down 2' going around the complete outside of the tent.  On this valance, screenprinting of Government-Furnished title information will be required to be completed by the tent provider.  There will be two 3' x 4' flag-like panels hanging from each of the roof rafters.  Each panel will weigh no more than 2 pounds.  Panels will be provided by the Exhibit Fabricator.  The tent diameter measurements are taken from flat side to flat side.  Both tents are to have side walls approximately 10' high.  Each tent will have an interior extruded aluminum frame made up of 2" x 3 7/8" elliptical tubes with a round tube at its center whose inside diameter is approximately 1 11/16".  Each vertical post will have a base plate.   The base plate (approximately 6" x 8" x 1/4") will have one hole (approximately 1 ¼ diameter) through which a 1" x 30" steel spike can be used to secure the structure to the surface on which the tent sits.  Welded to this base plate will be a steel pipe approximately 18" long, standing vertically. The vertical 10' high corner poles fit over these.  At the top of each pole there will be a cast aluminum bracket that will accept a horizontal pole from each of the vertical poles and the roof support pole.  In addition, there will be a ring on the bracket, both inside and outside of the tent that will fit through the valance, allowing a rope to be used with the tent stake that is driven into the pole base plate.  These two tents are to be set up touching each other at their corners and an interior weather proof corridor created between them using fill-in panels in the "V" shaped space on each side of their intersection.  The 20' diameter tent will have a 10' x 8' custom opening that must have the ability to be secured and closed with a zipper, if required.  This zippered opening may be utilized to form an access tunnel, by others, to a third tent (Saddle Tent which is not a part of this contract).   Another opening in this 20' diameter tent ibit.  This opening will be approximately 8' high x 7' wide.  A second horizontal pole will be required just above this 8' opening on the inside.  Across this opening there is to be clear vinyl flat strips hanging down allowing easy movement through, but providing some atmospheric closure to the space.   These will be supported by the second horizontal pole mentioned above.    Four drawings and 15 pictures of the initial tent model will be sent to interested offerors under separate cover and should be requested directly to Georgia Mason (304) 535-6496.  The optional tents mentioned above are to be the 35' diameter tents.  Exact quantities and timing on these tents are unknown.   Durable storage containers will be required to store all the components of each tent when dismantled for transport.  The weight and cube dimensions of each of these containers will be required.  An experienced employee to train National Park Service staff, on setting up, taking down, and packing these tents is essential. After contract award, an initial meeting with the National Park Service and the Exhibit Fabricator will be held on August 26, 2002 at the Harpers Ferry Center in Harpers Ferry, WV.  Review of the tents completed structure (work-in-progress) will be required by the terms of the contract.  This date is to be specified in your proposal.  Initial outdoor set-up at a location in Virginia (either Manassas or Lorton) will be required on or before November 1, 2002.  This location will be our exhibit fabricator's location.  The exhibit fabricator will hang the graphics on the tent after set-up.  Coordination with both the exhibit fabricator and the saddle tent provider is critical and part of this contract.   Additionally, there is to be a written training manual, including drawings, documenting the steps necessary to accomplish the set-up, take down and storage of the tent.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations with the sole source of supply, Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office, Patuxent River, MD (Bell Aerospace Services Inc.).  The NAWCAD intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office, Patuxent River MD (Bell Aerospace Services Inc) to provide Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) in support of the MV-22 and CV-22 Aircraft.  The PSE is required to support Marine Corps and Air Force Organizational and Intermediate Levels of Maintenance Activities. Various pieces of Support Equipment (SE) in multiple quantities will be required.  Also required is sustaining engineering services for the PSE.    The ordering period will cover a five (5) year period, that is, fiscal year 2003 through 2008. Bell Aerospace Services Inc. (BellAero) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Textron Inc.  BellAero was formed from Bell Helicopter Textron to provide Logistics support, maintenance services and aircraft Support Equipment design, development and production for the V22 Aircraft.  Bell-Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer of the V-22 Aircraft.  All peripheral equipment, including provisioned items for repair of repairables, spare and repair parts, technical manuals, support equipment, miscellaneous logistics support services, and data for these items as they become necessary for the program are also included.

<DESC>NA Project advertisement method:  Project available on compact disk with project data and amendments posted on the web site Project description/synopsis: The Olmsted Dam consists of five tainter gate bays, with hydraulic operated tainter gates, a 1400' & chr(39) & ' navigable pass, two boat abutmnets, four isolation joints, founded on pipe piles, and placement of scour protection.  The dam is being built using the in-the-wet construction techniques.  The contractor will perform foundation grading, install sheet pile cut-off walls, drive pipe piling, place scour protection, fabricate the concrete shells, lift and set the shells on the pre-driven pile foundation using tremie concrete to structurally connect the system.  Additional work shall include the fabrication and install the tainter gates, miscellaneous mechanical and electrical (including controls). Specialty floating equipment will be required to perform the in-the-wet construction.  Conceptual drawings are provided for a 2,800 ton catamaran, a screeding barge, floating batch plant, vibro-compaction and scour protection placement barge.  To meet tolerances the Contractor is required to use frames or templates for driving sheet piling and the pipe piles. The lifting frames have been partially designed and the Contractor must complete the design.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source contract with the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design to organize a forum on the topic of new directions in manufacturing.  The forum will be designed to bring together government policy makers, visionary leaders in the manufacturing industry, economists members of the manufacturing research community, developers of manufacturing systems, manufacturing workforce representatives and advocates, and end-users of manufacturing products to make presentations and hold discussions on the current state of the manufacturing enterprise in the United States and the challenges of the coming years.  Specifically, the Council will convene a workshop designed to bring together representatives from the diverse manufacturing community and design a program to address several of the following topics including:  robust manufacturing, micro/nano manufacturing, workforce and education issues, lean manufacturing, contract manufacturing, surge manufacturing, new strategies for product design and realization, globalization, and regulatory considerations.  NRC currently organizes a biennial Forum on Materials that is the model for the proposed Forum on Manufacturing.

<DESC>Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC is soliciting for research proposals that will aggressively incorporate flexible, affordable, and innovative torpedo signal processing control beyond its current baseline. The mission of the Torpedo APB is to address rapidly changing technology and constantly evolving threats necessitating the need to redefine the methodology for producing torpedo modifications. The need to identify weapon system shortfalls, select the best solutions, and establish proper feedback processes and tools to enable a data-driven, build-test-build approach to continually improve system performance is crucial.  Primarily, the projects scope will be defined by the development of torpedo signal processing algorithms involving signal processing, signal detection, signal classification and waveform design. The project will also  address Weapon Control. Weapons Control improvements will address the support tasks including Combat System interface, communication interface control, transmit waveform control and internal torpedo communication functions. These tasks support the overall torpedo functionality. The endstate to the proposed Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) will be the ability to maintain our undersea weapon advantage, thus ensuring maritime access and battle space superiority.  As an introduction to this new process, the Government will host a classified, to the Secret level, Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) program and related topics briefing.  Interested representatives of Government and industry are encouraged to attend on Wednesday, 14 August 2002.  No foreign participation allowed.  The briefing will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport from 8am  until 5pm.  General questions about Industry Day should be addressed to John Miech at (401) 832-4654 and detailed questions concerning this BAA or the Torpedo APB program should be directed to Mike Alperi, PMS404E at (202) 781-4444.  Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via e-mail, by fax or in writing to the following addresses:  Email: miechjr@npt.nuwc.navy.mil Fax: 	(401) 832-1134 Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport John Miech Code 8123, Building 990/2 1176 Howell Street Newport, RI 02841-1708 Information regarding security clearance/visit request and hotel information can be found at: http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil under Visitor Information. Attendance is limited to persons who have registered and have approved security clearances in place. Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests should be received not  later than              2 August 2002.  Registration requests will be confirmed by 7 August 2002. The scope of this BAA and the proposals solicited are limited and will be used for identifying innovative algorithm processing techniques for future detailed development.  The Navy intends to award up to three preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee studies from a total BAA budget of $300K.  Depending upon the success of the studies the potential exists for follow-on development contract awards.

Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria: · To what degree does the proposal demonstrate potential for improving signal and weapon processing control beyond the current torpedo processing baseline (Block IV)? · Can the proposed study/development be completed in time to support the Torpedo APB schedule? · What is the probability that the proposed study effort will meet the objectives stated in the offeror's proposal? · Does the proposed study effort appear to be realistically achievable with the funds requested? · To what degree will the benefits of the proposed study effort be limited by restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data? · What has been the offeror's past performance in signal process ing algorithm enhancements and weapon control improvements? These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with the first three being significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. At the conclusion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.

<DESC>This notice of intent to enter into Single Source Contracts, as well as the action to procure Technical Evaluation Services for RPDE and UHF Radios is cancelled.   <P>  <P> The Federal Aviation Administration plans to award single source contracts to ACS, NACI, SOHAR and Thane for technical evaluation services under the Next Generation Communication (NEXCOM) Rapid Preliminary Design Effort (RPDE) and UHF Radio Screening Information Requests (SIRs).  Each of these contractors had provided technical services to the RPDE and UHF Radio acquisition teams as subcontractors to the FAA’s Technical Assistance Contractor, TRW.  The FAA is severing its contractual obligation for these services from TRW because of an apparent organizational conflict of interest resulting from the recently announced acquisition of TRW by Northrop Grumman.  Each vendor has obtained a detailed knowledge of the requirements related to the RPDE and UHF Radio acquisitions.  The time required to complete a competitive acquisition for the technical evaluation services would likely delay award of the contracts for RPDE and UHF Radios and increase costs to the FAA.  The period of pe! rformance for these services will extend through the evaluation and an initial period following award of the RPDE and UHF Radio contracts.   <P> The approximate value of the contracts is as follows: <P> ACS     $ 81,605 NACI    $ 69,409 SOHAR   $ 13,315 Thane   $ 56,355 <P>

Attachment A
Solicitation  GS06P02GYC0050

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

PURPOSE:  This renewal contract is intended to supply the Air Force Academy with all software, personnel, supervision, transportation and other services necessary to perform remedial maintenance for existing modules, both, Progress and Oracle based, for systems currently on line at the Academy.  IMPACT:  System Design Group directly provides and installs all upgrades, patches, releases, programming, development, and integration for Progress and Oracle databases and software.  Award of this contract to another company will jeopardize the performance of this critical mission.  This is a mission-essential software conversion that will result in the integration of various applications into one relational database, used by cadets, faculty, and staff for several years. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  Systems Design Group, for over 10 years, has amassed an intimate knowledge of the Cadet Wing and SC requirements.  They possess invaluable experience with their highly successful implementations throughout the 34th Cadet training Wing and the 10th Logistics Squadron.  The learning curve and training time of a new cont5ractor prohibit cost effectiveness, especially due to the manning shortage and time constraints of the 34th Training Wing.  Systems Design Group is the only source capable of satisfying the Government because competition would prove extremely costly at this time.  This would also delay any new development, integration, migration, interfaces, and upgrades.  The cost charged by Systems Design Group is below the standard rate for systems integrator and software developer.  Systems Design Group has agreed to maintain their hourly rate above the inflation rate, for the prior year for each option year.  Concerns having the ability to furnish the above services/supplies are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the acquiring office listed in this notice within 15-calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  This notification should clearly show their ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy and reliability of the requirement.  This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond should furnish detailed data concerning, their capabilities and may request a copy of the solicitation when it becomes available.  All information is to be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Along with the above req2uest product information, please include company name, mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers.

<SOLNBR>MSI
<RESPDATE>080702
<CONTACT>LCDR John H. Windom,USN, 202-781-4965
<DESC>The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineer (SIAP SE), in concert with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and Joint Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO), solicits interest for participation in controlled field and laboratory demonstrations to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) systems. Using a multi-phase, multi-event approach, these demonstrations will use live-data inputs from military field-environment exercises, as well as recorded inputs during subsequent event phases in a laboratory environment. A Phase One event was successfully conducted during Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team (JCIET 02), requiring passive operation of each participating MSI system (no output to the data links, no local sensor integration). Phase Two and Phase Three MSI Systems Demonstrations will be c onducted in the laboratory environment. Specifically, a Phase Two event will be conducted in Oct 02 and will require passive operation, but the systems will be able to use local sensors if/as applicable. A Phase Three event has yet to be planned, but this event will place the MSI systems into the data networks as active participants, enabling MSI nodes at each sensor to share data among each other. During all phases, quantitative comparisons of the various MSI systems' output file (i.e., composite track-file databases) to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining baseline performance. Results from each of the three phases of the MSI Demonstration will be used to provide recommendations for operational, technical, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability that maps to current (and influences future) Joint Requirements Overs ight Council (JROC)-validated requirements. INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING AND SITE SURVEY FOR PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION. Interest is hereby solicited for participation in the Phase Two demonstrations to be conducted for approximately two weeks in Oct 02 at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), Fort Huachuca, AZ. This event will involve controlled playback of live-data recorded at JCIET 02 as input to each of the participating MSI systems. Quantitative comparisons of the participants' output files to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining system performance. An Industry Day Briefing and Site Survey highlighting Phase Two objectives and participation requirements will be held 14-15 Aug 02 at JITC, Bldg. 57305, Conference Room 2 from 0900-1600. On 14 Aug 02, the Government will provide an MSI briefing, conduct a site survey and a group questions  and answers session.  On 15 Aug, individual company breakout conferences will be scheduled, where attendees can discuss with the Government their company specific issues related to participation.  A SECRET security clearance will be required for vendor personnel attending this industry event. See instructions below for submitting the required visit request/security clearance information. Those companies seeking to participate in the 14-15 Aug Industry Day Briefing should contact LCDR John H. Windom NLT 7 Aug at (202)-781-4965 or by e-mail at WindomJH@NAVSEA.NAVY.MIL.  NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE. Vendors interested in participating in the MSI Systems Phase Two Demonstration must submit their notifications of interest to participate and both name and physical/functional description of their MSI systems by Wednesday, 28 Aug 02.  Via written notification, companies will  be invited to participate and provided a demonstration schedule. A SECRET security clearance will be required for personnel attending. Any vendors/systems not selected for participation in this event will be provided written notice with supporting rationale for their exclusion from this phase of the MSI Demonstrations. GOAL OF THE MSI DEMONSTRATIONS. The goal of the multi-phased, multi-event demonstrations is to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control MSI systems. Results will be used to provide recommendations for standards for an objective capability that map to (and influence future) JROC-validated requirements. The Government will derive objective, quantitative performance criteria for this experiment from Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) and Combat Identification (CID) Capstone Requirements Documents (CRD). The data analysis will be perfo rmed based on ground truth data, inputs from networks, and data recorded by each MSI system participating in the demonstrations. The Government will use the criteria to compare ground truth with the composite track-file of each MSI device, to gain a better understanding of individual system's capabilities. The Government will conduct data analysis and will be responsible for generating quick-look and formal performance reports. A list of applicable documents that form the basis of the SIAP attributes and the Government's analysis for these demonstrations is available upon request. The intent of these demonstrations is for data collection purposes and will not result in a contract award. BACKGROUND AND PHASE ONE MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION INFORMATION. Multi-Source Integration (MSI) is the process that (1) performs association/correlation and fusion of target track and measurement  data received over a variety of tactical and intelligence data networks (e.g., Link 11, Link 16, CEC, TIBS, and Live Radar) to create and maintain a composite track-file database, and (2) combines a priori data with dynamic data. The MSI systems may have organic sensors that contribute to the composite track-file database, and they may also have the capability to both transmit and receive data on the various data links. Previous studies have demonstrated that fusion/correlation techniques, algorithms, and technologies are mature, but there exists a lack of common quantitative standards for assessing the performance of candidate MSI systems. The studies recommended development of technical, operational, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability. An MSI Systems Phase One event was successfully conducted during JCIET 02 in Apr 02. The Governmen t provided the following live data feeds to three participating MSI systems: Link 11, Link 16, SADL, CEC, TIBS , TPS-75, ARSR-4, and STARS. The Government also recorded the available live-data feeds and the truth data (e.g., TSPI) from all JCIET-network participants. The recorded data is currently being used for post-event, quantitative performance analysis, and selected recordings from this data will be used in the Phase Two event as input feeds for the participating systems. PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION DATA HANDLING AND SECURITY. A Government team will be the primary operators of all Government-furnished equipment (e.g., data input feeds, interfaces, and recorders) and will ensure strict control of data and results to protect against release of classified information, as well as, proprietary interests and intellectual property. Each participant will be required to pro vide a copy of (or access to) its system's output file (i.e., track database data-extraction file).  Details concerning security procedures for the handling, storage, and processing of classified materials will be provided to participants that take part in the event. CONSIDERATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION. The Government's intent is to provide a forum for the conduct of these demonstrations and a means of data collection and analysis. Individual participants will not receive funding from the Government to support personnel expenses or the transportation, storage, operation, maintenance, or repair of their system and/or equipment. Specifically, for the Phase Two event, the Government will provide the following to each invited participant:  (1) Opportunity to demonstrate their product and to influence the development of an objective-capability st andard for MSI. (2) Copies of the live-data feed recordings used as input sources for Phase Two (Subject to use and non-disclosure terms and conditions of participation). (3) Workspace area at JITC. (4) Results of the Government's evaluation of the participant's own system's data output file. (5) Access to the Government's software-based evaluation tool used to evaluate the system's output file, to the extent access is authorized. PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. To be considered eligible for participation in the demonstrations, vendors must meet the following requirements: (1) By Wednesday, 28 Aug 02, provide the Government with notification of intent and/or interest in participating in the Phase Two event, and furnish both the name and a physical/functional description of their MSI system (not code level; describe as a black box). (2) Participant 's MSI system must function at the Command and Control (C2) system level (e.g., link level) and support the use of more than one type of input source. The Government will specify the data feeds and formats to be used in the proposed Phase Two event. (3) Participants will be responsible for all expenses associated with participation in the demonstration and to honor all terms and conditions of a Bailment Agreement, which will specify details of the demonstration including formats for common inputs such as requirements for electrical and physical layer interface, data link layer, network layer (addressing), and transport layer (format), security classification guidance and applicable data handling, use and non-disclosure requirements. (4) During the demonstration, participants must be willing to provide all equipment and personnel required to operate and support their system duri ng the demonstration; provide access to output data (track database data-extraction file ) for recording purposes; and be available to support and participate in data reduction effort (if/as needed). (5) Participating companies must be able to satisfy SECRET (NOFORN) security clearance requirements. (6) Eligible participants will be required to enter into a Bailment Agreement for use of their equipment. SECURITY CLEARANCE FOR INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING.

<SUBJECT>A -- Space-Based Space Surveillance Industry Day
<DESC>The Air Force intends to hold an Industry Day for preliminary market research and informational purposes as it relates to a Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) system.  The goal of this session is to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in the study and subsequent development of this system.  In April 1996, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) was launched to demonstrate Space-Based Space Surveillance Operations (SBSSO).  The SBSSO sensor, the Space Based Visible (SBV) telescope, is the last surviving sensor on the Mid-course Space experiment (MSX) and reaches its predicted end of life in FY05.  A follow-on capability is needed to meet Space Control requirements for significantly improved detection and timeliness of high interest space event reports.  SBSS is the next-generation family of these systems. Notionally a constellation of electro-optical sensing satellites, SBSS will search for, detect, and track objects in near earth and deep space orbits.  In order to facilitate FY03 acquisition activities, an SBSS Industry Day is planned for the late July or early August timeframe, and will be held at the SMC/AD Mission Area Prime Integration Contractor (MAPIC) facility; TRW Systems Campus, Redondo Beach, CA. The agenda will include MAPIC presentation of an FY00 Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Study that merged Capstone Requirement Document (CRD) requirements with Mission Area Plan needs to support Defensive Counterspace Strategies.  Companies interested in attending the Industry Day should contact Capt Arevalo to put themselves on the Industry Day mailing list.  The exact time, date, and location of the Industry Day will be forwarded to companies put on the mailing list.  The briefing will take place at the Secret/SI/TK level; as such, please fax clearances to TRW Security, Attn: Mark Mason at (310) 546-7833.  Subsequent to Industry Day, the SBSS project team will request a Statement of Capabilities and facilitate one-on-one discussions with interested contractors at a later date.  In addition to sending clearances, interested companies are limited to four (4) attendees each and should RSVP with Mr. Joe Vanderpoorten by telephone at (310) 812-4032, or by email: joe.vanderpoorten@trw.com.  Please direct any questions or comments of a contractual nature to SMC/ADK, Capt Garth Arevalo by telephone or email (see POC's below).
