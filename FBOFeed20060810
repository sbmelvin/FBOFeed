<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871151     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS of not more than twenty (20) pages in length, for the study entitled "Impacts of Recent Hurricane Activity on Historic Shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico."  MMS/DOI intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study that provides MMS with information on how recent hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has impacted known historic shipwreck sites.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services".  This pre-solicitation notice is being published in accordance with FAR 15.202, entitled "Advisory Multi-Step Process".  The result of this pre-solicitation notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a pre-solicitation for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the MMS.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements.  PURPOSE:  The objective of this study is to determine the impacts caused by recent hurricane activity on known historic shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico.  This study proposes to investigate six known historic shipwreck sites, and one artificial reef site, in water depths less than 130 feet below sea level, which have been previously documented, in order to make a comparison of these sites pre- and post- hurricane.  As of today, no comparable studies have been conducted through MMS.   BACKGROUND:  In the second half of 2005 the Gulf of Mexico was significantly impacted by two major hurricanes, Katrina and Rita.  Together the destructive forces of these storms destroyed over 100 offshore oil and gas platforms and jackup rigs.  Wave heights associated with these storms were massive.  For Hurricane Katrina, National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy #42040 located approximately 65 miles south of Dauphin Island, Alabama, registered an estimated maximum wave height of 105 feet, with sustained seas over 12 feet for 47 hours.  At the time of peak wave height the eye of the storm was approximately 73 miles west of the buoy.  For Hurricane Rita, NDBC buoy #42035 located approximately 22 miles east of Galveston, Texas, registered an estimated maximum wave height of 38 feet.  At the time of peak wave height the eye of Hurricane Rita was approximately 47 miles east of the buoy.  Impacts to the seafloor from sustained waves associated with these hurricanes damaged a significant number of pipelines in the area.  It is expected that damage would also occur to historic shipwrecks within the storm surge area. The MMS anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract for this study with an estimated total amount of between $200,000.00 and $250,000.00.   The anticipated period of performance is two years (24 months).  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Archaeological services are required to perform remote sensing surveys (magnetometer and sidescan sonar) and diver investigations over known shipwreck sites and one artificial reef site in the Gulf of Mexico.  These sites will be selected by the MMS.  Data collected from the new surveys will be compared with existing data to determine the extent of storm impacts.  Information on sediments and storm activity in the area (e.g., wave height and period, sediment surface interface, sediment size analysis, etc.), and sediment disturbance using a wave-current interaction model, will also be examined. This requirement has following scope of work: (1) Conduct archaeological and geophysical remote sensing (magnetometer and sidescan sonar) surveys (out to 300-meters from center) at six known shipwreck sites and one artificial reef site to determine the current extent of these sites; (2) carry out diver investigations of these sites to document the current condition of sites; (3) collect box cores and conduct sedimentary analysis at each of these sites; (4) execute wave-current interaction models, including wave height and period, and sediment surface interface at each of the sites examined; (5) analyze previously collected remote sensing data and newly acquired remote sensing data over each site to identify changes in site formation; (6) conduct archival and historical research on each of the sites; and  (7) submit a Final Report of Findings that includes analysis of all data collected. HOW TO RESPOND:  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing their capabilities in writing to the address as shown below: an original and five (5) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing key scientific and technical personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302 from Ripple Effect Communications Inc.  The purpose of this procurement is to perform analysis of public comments on changing appendix materials.  Ripple Effect Communications has specialized programmatic knowledge and experience to provide the services required. Ripple Effect Communications is familiar with the nature of the work and has developed techniques for accomplishing tasks in an efficient and cost effective manner. Having Ripple Effect Communications provide these services allows for continuity of the activities without loss of productivity.     

The period of performance shall be for 3 months from 8/25/06 through 11/24/06. 

Building on programmatic knowledge and experience, the contractor shall accomplish the following tasks: 

•	Develop a web-based public comment form.
•	Categorize, organize and report on public comments.
•	Develop a web based data entry form.
•	Collect and enter data of public comments.

NLM has determined that Ripple Effect Communications is uniquely qualified to provide the above services.  Ripple Effect Communications has highly specialized and relevant expertise.  A company other than Ripple Effect Communications would require management to spend time orienting and training staff.     Consequently, fewer services could be provided in the same amount of time and the project would operate less efficiently and effectively.     

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a 102-day contract extension, on a sole source basis, to Information International Associates, Inc. (IIA), for an extension to the period of performance and effective ordering period beginning September 19, 2006, and ending December 31, 2006, for the GSFC Library Services Contract, NAS5-01161.	Under the current contract, IIA provides GSFC with the necessary library system maintenance and related services needed for a broad and comprehensive traditional and electronic library and information science support function, encompassing all aspects of information storage, retrieval, and delivery to ensure timely and efficient provision of information resources relevant to the GSFC mission.  The primary information resources consist of a dynamic collection of books, journals, documents and multimedia; access to a network of other library collections through cooperative InterLibrary Loan activities; and a wide range of electronic resources created for or accessible through the GSFC Digital Library (http://library.gsfc.nasa.gov), including licensed electronic library assets.  The extension is necessary in order to avoid a break in services which would be extremely disruptive to the Center’s library operations and could severely impact library services.  If this interim requirement were to be competed, the government would incur additional costs, primarily associated with the transition of a new management staff and its phase-in efforts to develop and coordinate staffing levels, schedules, and work requirements.  The training and time required to enable a new contractor to provide the necessary level of technical and professional services during the interim period would exceed the time required to award the follow-on contract.  The contract extension provides a continuity of support unavailable on the open market without a significant and expensive learning curve that would result in unacceptable delay in meeting the government’s requirement.  Exposing the Center to a transition activity in such a relatively short period of time is not efficient or cost effective as it would cause substantial duplication of costs.  Extending the current contract will keep the possibility of negative impacts to Center library services to a minimum.  This procurement is authorized under (FAR) 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) “Only One Responsible Source.”   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 25, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Written responses may be e-mailed or faxed. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Any resulting contractual agreements based on responses to the BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition in full compliance within the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to conduct studies, perform testing, develop, and demonstrate technologies to mitigate the risk of the Joint Laser Ordnance Neutralization System (JLONS) program as it proceeds through concept refinement phase toward a Milestone B decision after FY08.  Interested Offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the Offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal not considered to be responsive.  After evaluation of the white papers, full proposals will be request!  ed based on the merits of the information received.  White papers for exploratory development are sought in the following five technology areas: 1. MODELING - Previous low order testing was aimed at quickly identifying techniques to produce the lowest reaction yield possible.  Several different methods were employed and resulted in low order reactions, but not necessarily the lowest yield possible.  In order to produce consistent minimized yields, the interaction between the laser and the target during neutralization needs to be further investigated.  By modeling the laser's effects on the munitions, NAVEODTECHDIV can gain a better understanding of JLONS capabilities to produce reliable low order reactions through a range of unexploded ordnance.  The goal of the proposed modeling effort is to illustrate munitions behavior during laser irradiation and characterize the occurrence of low-order reactions in unexploded ordnance.  The principle topics to be studied involve: (a) G!  eneral reaction analysis (heat diffusion & pressure buildup); (b) Comp osition-B (Comp-B) melt phenomenon; (c) Metallurgical analyses & thermal gradients.  The models will provide an overall investigation into the reactions of the munitions during laser irradiation.  Heat diffusion through the casing and explosive will be detailed as well as the pressure build up within the vessel to the casing's ultimate failure.  Models will focus on the activity of the contained explosive, with particular interest in Comp-B, and the reaction of the steel casing when exposed to instant, intense heating.  Because Comp-B filled 155mm ordnance produced the most erratic high order responses to irradiation in previous testing, it became a focus of the investigation into low yield behavior.  Comp-B is a combination of RDX and TNT.  One theory speculates that because TNT has a relatively low melting point, that when it is heated by the laser a portion of the Comp-B is becoming molten within of the steel casing and in its liquid form is less susceptible to the explos!  ion's blast waves; therefore, it can act as a damper against the detonation wave propagation.  Another phenomenon, working in conjunction with the melting of TNT, may occur when the laser hits the steel casing; it is directing an intense, concentrated amount of heat to a small area.  It is theorized that the heating places stress on the steel casing and can weaken the strength of the steel that is in direct contact with the laser's beam.  As a result, less internal pressure builds within the casing before case failure occurs, and because of this, the blast may exhibit a lower yield.  In order to investigate these actions, models of munitions behavior must be created.  Heat diffusion and pressure buildup inside the munitions can be simulated.  Models to demonstrate the expected behavior of Comp-B as the casing temperature is increased are needed.  Modeling efforts will also investigate the behavior of the steel casing during laser exposure.  Temperature gradients through the!   casing and explosive as the laser is applied at different power stren gths should be modeled in two dimensions, three if possible.  Also, understanding the effects of slow heating vs. faster heating in relation to the yield of explosion for specified explosives may be useful.  2. NIGHT VISION STUDIES - In order to understand the current state of the practice for night vision and thermal imaging system, NAVEODTECHDIV desires a technical trade study of various potential night vision and thermal imaging systems.  The cost, size, ability to be used with the JLONS, and other technical specifications will be evaluated.  The follow-on effort will encompass selecting one or several systems to test the reduction in effectiveness during night operations.  Testing will be conducted with a JLONS-like laser (provided by the Offeror) and will be conducted on ordnance laid out in all or part of the JLONS Performance Specification Effectiveness test.  The test will be performed at night as well as during the day to determine the reduction in performance of th!  e system.  In addition, the system will be evaluated for ease of use, resolution of the targets at various ranges, and any adverse visual reactions during neutralization.  A report will be written to summarize the testing as well as the findings of the entire study.  The report will be used to update the JLONS CDD and Performance Specification as necessary.  3. LOW ORDER TESTING - Testing will be performed using a JLONS-like laser system (provided by the Offeror) on previously untested ordnance to determine the capability of the laser to produce a low-order reaction.  These types of ordnance will include TNT filled 105mm projectiles, foreign ordnance, and various types of landmines. The NAVEODTECHDIV will meet with the JEOD user representatives to determine appropriate ordnance for testing, and the user representatives will approve the final list of test items.  Testing will also be performed on previously tested ordnance that did not meet low-order requirements to try to p!  roduce low-order reactions.  Because the previous low-order testing wa s aimed at producing the lowest reaction yield as quickly as possible, several methods were tested, but did not necessarily produce the lowest results.  This data are still valuable for an understanding of how to produce low-order reactions, and will be reviewed prior to testing to help determine the techniques attempted for producing low-order reactions in the untested ordnance.  Information from modeling efforts taking place in FY06, to try to better understand the actual phenomenology of the laser-ordnance interactions that produce low-orders, shall be provided.  Because this data were not available during the previous testing, methods were mainly trial-and-error.  The proposed testing will leverage the new information available through modeling and recent test data to plan an organized approach to the low-order techniques attempted.  Measurements of blast overpressure will be used to determine reaction yield.  In addition, temperature-calibrated instrumentation (such as !  a temperature-calibrated Forward-Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) and thermocouples) will also be used to more accurately determine the physical characteristics of the round needed to produce low-order reactions, such as case temperature and time-to-temperature data.  This data will be used not only to characterize the reactions, but to help more accurately predict how to produce low-order reactions in items that may be tested in the future.  This data will also further define the type of laser and delivery of the laser energy the JLONS must achieve, and will be added to the JLONS specifications.  Data will also be gathered on the time to neutralize, to further define the mission scenarios the system is expected to meet.  4. DIAL-A-REACTION TESTING - Testing will be performed using a JLONS-like laser system (provided by the Offeror) ordnance to determine the capability of the laser to produce reactions with a specific given yield (varying between 25% - 100%) using a specific techni!  que.  The NAVEODTECHDIV will meet with the JEOD end-users to determine  appropriate ordnance for testing, and the end-users will approve the final list of test items.  The list may include (but is not limited to) both thick and thin shelled projectiles and mines, submunitions and plastic cased munitions.  Data from previous low-order testing, models, and demonstrations will be used to plan the tests to determine what techniques will be used to achieve the desired reactions. The ability of the system to provide consistent results will be characterized through a combination of measurements including blast characteristics (including but not limited to blast overpressure) and laser parameters (including but not limited to flux density on target, beam power, time to neutralize, etc.).  If the results prove successful, the data will contribute to TTP generation and the refinement of the dial-a-reaction requirement for the JLONS.  5. VEHICLE INTEGRATION STUDIES - The JLONS is expected to be mounted to one of two prime mover vehicles: for the Army, the!   new Medium Mine Protected Vehicle (MMPV), EOD variant (currently in development); and for the Air Force and Marines, the RC-50, manufactured by ASV, Inc.  Both vehicles will pose unique integration challenges for the JLONS.  While it is assumed there must be some modification to the vehicles to accept the JLONS, the desire is still to minimize those modifications as much as possible.  Additionally, while it is expected that some of the JLONS subsystems will be large, the desire remains to minimize the size and weight of these systems as much as possible to facilitate logistics and support of the JLONS in operational use.  Study relating to the integration of the JLONS to either or both prime movers will address the following subtopics:  Location/extent of modifications necessary to integrate the JLONS to the prime mover.  Specific modifications both internally and externally will be addressed and the effect on the overall vehicle safety will be addressed.  Weight and size !  of each major subsystem (power, chiller, beam control, laser and assoc iated optics, fire control) will be examined for potential reduction to weight and size to facilitate ease of installation, maintenance, and repair.  In addition, lowest replaceable units (LRU) for each subsystem will be identified based on the likelihood of needing repair or maintenance.  Logistical studies on subsystems and/or subcomponents will provide information on availability, reliability, endurance, supportability and maintainability.  In addition, lowest replaceable units (LRU) for each subsystem will be identified based on the likelihood of needing repair or maintenance.  With each of these areas, several options should be explored with regards to cost and feasibility as well as the ability of the component or system to meet the JLONS technical requirements.  White Papers:  White papers will be accepted for the above technical areas for a period of two years after the initial release of this announcement.  Each white paper is limited to five pages in length and may!   address only one of the above listed technology areas.  The white paper will consist of three primary sections: Technical, Management, and Cost.

<DESC>The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT), has responsibility for the regulation of hazardous materials transportation by highway, rail, air, water and pipeline.  PHMSA is the primary federal regulatory agency responsible for ensuring that the Nation's 2.3 million miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines are safe, reliable, and environmentally sound.  From the federal level, PHMSA develops, implements, and enforces the regulations concerning pipeline construction, maintenance and operation.  We share enforcement responsibilities with our state pipeline safety partners.

The nation's pipelines are a transportation system that enables the safe movement of extraordinary quantities of energy products to industry and consumers, literally fueling our economy and way of life. The arteries of the Nation's energy infrastructure, as well as the safest and least costly ways to transport energy products, our oil and gas pipelines provide the resources needed for national defense, heat and cool our homes, generate power for business and fuel an unparalleled transportation system.

Over the past several years, PHMSA has strengthened its role in assuring the safety of the nation’s pipeline system in numerous ways, including promulgating new regulations on integrity management (IM). These new regulations, together with the new inspection processes being used by regulators to evaluate operator compliance, rely for their effectiveness on the operators’ access to new technologies that support improved safety and integrity performance and on regulators’ access to information on the appropriate use and limitations of these technologies.  

PHMSA uses a contractor to support the ongoing and expected new challenges of its integrity management mission.  Support is on demand services in the form of technical reports, briefs, white papers, training curriculums, inspection protocols, database & website management, PowerPoint slideshows and physical travel to attend and execute requested support.

Please visit http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/ for a full description of PHMSA’s various pipeline safety programs and how this contract will support many of these vital safety initiatives.

They have two offices, one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.    The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580-2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 504-8620 for Andalucia.    The United States Air Force intends to solicit proposals (FA5575-06-R-0009) for a Firm-Fixed Price Contract for the  Replace of Sewer Lines at Building 1301.    Contract magnitude is between $250,000 and $500,000.    The successful contractor will be selected using    Past performance / Price Tradeoff procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.    You are requested to notify the following E-Mail addressee if you intend to download the solicitation that will eventually be posted on this posting service; borja.barbacid@moron.af.mil, it is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this solicitation and/or any other postings published by our office.    However, failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape or form.    Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made.    As a last resort if you cannot download the solicitation from the internet EPS site, we will provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide a two working day notice (work days are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above E-Mail Addressee or to FAX 34 95-584-8054.    The Government anticipates and reserves the right, to issue all solicitation documents including specifications and drawings in the English language only.

Failure to have a DUNS number at the time of award may delay the award and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified best value offeror who has a DUNS number.    All contractors are advised that they should be registered in the Central Contractor Registry.    Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/.

<DESC>The Cataloging and Distribution Service of the Library of Congress intends to make a sole-source firm-fixed price award to the incumbent, Minaret Corporation for a base and three option years, for the use of Minaret Web v.3.0 software, customized to provide the external library community with access to Library of Congress Classification schedules and correlations to Library of Congress Subject Headings. 
 
The Library of Congress uses the Minaret software system for the creation, update, and searching of MARC classification records; and for supporting external distribution products that provide access to Library of Congress Classification data in both MARC format and in the required hierarchical display, with correlations to Library of Congress Subject Headings. 
 
The Library of Congress intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); the regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-(1).  Award is anticipated on or about 15 May 2006. 
 
It is the Library’s belief that Minaret Corporation is the only contractor presently qualified to provide this critical software without significant interruption of the operations of the Library's online classification system, and/or significant duplication of effort and cost to the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any other company that (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity, or is capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business; and (2) believes it can meet the performance requirements of the specifications noted above without significant interruption of the operations of the Library's online classification system, and without significant duplication of effort and cost to the Government, is invited to apply to the Library for consideration.  All written proposals including capabilities/facilities statements and past performance summaries that are received within fifteen (15) days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and a determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice remains solely within the discretion of the Government.

This purchase is to provide expert guidance and assistance with Human Resource and Ethics related issues.  The contractor will work directly with the Director of NHGRI and his senior staff to assist management with ethics and workforce planning needs. The duties will include: assisting with the monitoring and interpretation of new ethics regulations; assisting with the development and delivery of the annual ethics training, ensuring that any changes to the regulations are incorporated; ensuring 100% completion rate of ethics training for all NHGRI staff; counseling employees about ethics-related issues; preparing ethics reports for distribution to higher authorities; advising senior staff about workforce management and planning strategies; advising senior staff about employee relations issues; recommending options for remediation as necessary; coordinating search committees for two highly visible positions within the OD/NHGRI; reviewing, updating,, and/or drafting position descriptions and performance plans; counseling employees impacted by A-76.  The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and adequacy of the proposed approach; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance. 

Ms. Glynn has worked in the field of HR for over 20 years at the National Institutes of Health.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the previous experience and familiarity of the staff makes Ms. Glynn   uniquely qualified and will allow the continuation of critical services without interruption.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541612 and the Size Standard is $6.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.

Description:

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd PO Box 3014, Houston, TX 77030.  This purchase is for computer programming, Spanish translation, interviewing, and data processing support as a supplemental study for the “Promoting Smoke-Free Indoor Air Policy in Mexican American Households” study.  The specific duties will include assisting in the translation of survey instruments into Spanish; administering the Family Network, Illness Representation, and Perceived Risk survey via interview format at the baseline, and 6-month post intervention assessments to the study participants; and to prepare a dataset containing the interview responses for analysis.  The period of performance will be from August 2006 through July 2007. The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and adequacy of the proposed approach; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance. 

The sole source determination is based on providing continuity to the study participants and maintaining accurate study results for a study already in progress.  A research protocol entitled “Promoting Smoke-Free Indoor Air Policy in Mexican American Households” is currently being conducted by this contractor.  This request is for supplemental interviews for the existing protocol.  Changing variables at this time by awarding the supplemental work to an outside contractor would be disruptive and confusing to the study participants to be interviewed by two different interviewers during the same time frame and could result in incorrect data analysis.  By awarding the supplemental work to this contractor the government would save time by reducing the time necessary for training and understanding of the study. The government would also save money by reducing the cost of survey development,  interviewing and data processing.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541611 and the Size Standard is $6.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd PO Box 3014, Houston, TX 77030.  This purchase is for sampling and recruitment, Spanish translation, interviewing, and data processing support for a research project entitled “The Role of Family Health History and Culture in Health Decision Making”.  The specific duties will include: identifying 200 households within the Mano a Mano cohort that meet eligibility criteria for the project; assist in the translation of survey instruments into Spanish; administer the baseline and 4-week post feedback survey instruments to adult members of each identified household (1000 interviews; 1500 hours); and prepare a dataset containing the interview responses for analysis.  The period of performance will be from September 15,  2006 through September 14, 2007. The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and adequacy of the proposed approach; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance. 

The sole source determination is based on providing continuity to the study participants and maintaining accurate study results for the study.  The sampling and recruitment for this project must come from the Mano a Mano cohort, a group that MD Anderson has previously worked with under a different study.  Working with MD Anderson will allow the government to utilize the relationship already developed between the contractor and the study group, thus reducing the time necessary for training and understanding the study objectives.  It would also save money by reducing the cost of survey development,  interviewing and data processing.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to award a sole source letter contract for the acquisition of the completion of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Cavity Door Drive System (CDDS) by MPC Products Corporation. Definitization will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.603.  The estimated value of the letter contract is $20M, with deliverables due approximately twenty-four months from the effective date of the letter contract. The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub millimeter observations.  The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center).  The SOFIA observatory will be the world’s largest and most sensitive airborne observatory.  The aircraft will operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet. The telescope will look out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft and allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before.  The estimated life of the operational program is 20 years. NASA/DFRC intends to procure services from MPC Products Corporation of Skokie, IL 60077. The authority for other than full and open competition is: “only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).”  MPC is the only responsible source since they have already completed approximately 75% of this effort, to include the CDDS requirements review, preliminary design review, prototype lab test, and both hardware and software critical design reviews.  As a result, they are uniquely and intimately familiar with CDDS development and characteristics, particularly as they apply to the evolving SOFIA project.  Work remaining on the CDDS includes performing cavity door airplane tests, “red label” delivery (of an airworthy system), open door flight tests, system flight test readiness review, first article inspection and “black label” delivery (of a fully approved system). Any other contractor, selected in a competitive procurement, would need to gain sufficient project knowledge and technical expertise to ensure continued CDDS progress.  Due to the immense complexities of the SOFIA project, and the interrelationships of Government and contractor participants, the time needed to gain this knowledge and expertise would cause unacceptable disruptions to that progress, particularly since the CDDS is currently on the program schedule “Critical Path”.  Additionally, another contractor would have to engage an inspection process to determine whether work previously performed by MPC should be accepted or rejected.  It is likely that questions of attribution and possible disputes would naturally arise over the quality of such work, requiring time consuming resolution and settlement.  These reasons justify procuring the work exclusively from MPC. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on August 25, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to award a sole source contract for the acquisition of the completion of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Airborne System Development Integration and Test by L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.P. The estimated value of the contract is $40M, with deliverables due approximately twenty-four months from the effective date of the contract. The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub millimeter observations.

The telescope will look out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft and allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before.  The estimated life of the operational program is 20 years. NASA/DFRC intends to procure services from L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.P. of Waco, Texas, 76715-4820. The authority for other than full and open competition is: “only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).” L3 Communications is the only responsible source since they have already completed approximately 75% of the design, development, test, and integration of the structurally modified B747-SP portion of the SOFIA program. The Boeing 747-SP aircraft was delivered to L3 Communications in 1997 at their facilities in Waco, TX. The telescope assembly has been installed in the aircraft and has undergone basic operational testing. As a result, they are uniquely and intimately familiar with Airborne System development and characteristics, particularly as they apply to the evolving SOFIA project.  Work remaining on the Airborne System primarily entails systems integration and ground and flight performance testing, with development of certain observatory unique subsystems, such as electronics equipment, and some development and completion of installations. The aircraft is currently disassembled and is not flight worthy. Due to the immense complexities of the SOFIA project, and the interrelationships of Government and contractor participants, the time needed to gain this knowledge and expertise would cause unacceptable disruptions to that progress, particularly since the Airborne System is currently on the program schedule “Critical Path”. Additionally, another contractor would have to engage an inspection process to determine whether work previously performed by L3 Communications should be accepted or rejected. It is likely that questions of attribution and possible disputes would naturally arise over the quality of such work, requiring time consuming resolution and settlement. These reasons justify procuring the work exclusively from L3 Communications. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for CIS Support to provide voice communications to the NATO Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLT) Mobile Operations in support of the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.

This Notification of Intent (NOI) covers the first of two phase of this project. The primary objective of the first phase is to provide secure High Frequency (HF) voice to the NATO OMLTs within Afghanistan territory. The second phase of the procurement will be for Crypto/Satellite phones (details will be advised at a later date).

The secure voice communication requirement addressed by this project is the internal communication between mobile teams, static NATO Communications Centres at Afghanistan National Army Garrisons, Regional HQs and ISAF HQ. This will underpin robust force protection and command and control capabilities for these teams while they conduct their tasks. OLMT will follow the Afghan National Army (ANA) during training and operations; hence they need to be highly mobile and free of geographical restrictions caused by the eventual communications solution.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) procedure with the additional opportunity for the Nations in response to this Notification of Intent (NOI) to nominate bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 2.5 million Euros ($3.2 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-11970-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO CONFIDENTIAL.  

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

OMLTs will be employed at ANA Corps, Brigade and Battalion level, as well at ANA garrisons. The main tasks are to mentor, coach and facilitate continual training of the ANA units after their initial training at the Kabul Military training centre (KMTC), as well as supporting ANAs operational employment planning and execution. OMLTs will provide the critically important conduit for liaison between ANA units and nearby ISAF units.

Mobile units (OLMTs) and static centres (garrisons) must be able to use secure HF voice communication at all times (24 hours/7 days). A multicast functionality is required in situations where urgent messages have to be forwarded to many OLMTs at the same time. The security requirement for information exchange and classification of information is up to and including ISAF CONFIDENTIAL, the security solution must be releasable to all ISAF contributing nations/units.  

The solution for mobile units must be man portable and suited for HF radio set (appropriate antenna system included) for on-foot operations. The solution for static units and centres must be of the same type of HF radio set (appropriate antenna system, amplifier with the focus on Afghanistan territory, recharging capability for mobile teams and batteries included). A tactical secure HF radio system with NATO approved crypto equipment will constitute the multicast solution.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURE HF VOICE

All versions of equipment (portable, static and vehicle versions) should be user friendly. Users should be able to prepare the equipment to use and operate its primary functions without any training, and users should be able to operate all functionality of the equipment by reference to the provided user documentation. Training should be provided for management and control functions. This system consists of 56 mobile teams (man portable version of HF radio set) and 20 static locations (14 garrisons, 5 regional commands and ISAF HQ – 20 static versions of HF radio set).

The equipment will be used within Afghanistan territory (high mountains, long distances, harsh and dusty environment) requiring military specification of the system.

The overall requirements for all versions of the HF radios set (portable static and vehicle) include:

- frequency range - 1.5-30 MHZ
- type of modulation - AM (clear voice mode)
- version requirements - portable, static and vehicle versions
- emissions (ITU code) - J3E
- modes of operations - ALE
- crypto equipment - embedded crypto for portable, static and vehicle versions (approved for use within NATO)
- antenna system - appropriate antennas for static and mobile versions

CRYPTO EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS

ISAF requirement for classified HF voice and data services, information exchange and classification of information is up to and including ISAF CONFIDENTIAL, the security solution must be releasable to all ISAF contributing nations/units. The system will deliver limited and interim DCIS capabilities that will provide ISAF with classified and unclassified voice services and user equipment to eligible deployed OMLT teams.

Crypto equipment system management will be carried out from the NATO NGCS strategic network to the maximum extent possible. Nevertheless, ISAF will have limited in-theatre capabilities to manage their crypto key distribution and secure voice services.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

In addition, personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO CONFIDENTIAL security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 23 August 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: August 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: September 2006

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Pathophysiological Progression and Relationships for Selected Endpoints This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this  notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00208.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 541710, and the SBA size standard is 500 employees.   I.     Project Identification:   Pathophysiological Progression and Relationships for Selected Endpoints II.   Period of Performance:   Award date to December 15, 2007 III. Estimated Labor Hours:  540 hours    Background   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development  (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is currently developing methodologies and information sources to use as guidelines for acute exposure to various compounds, including air toxics.  Overall, this project is being proposed as a means to advance the science that may be  utilized in making estimates of safe exposures with special focus on inhalation exposure scenarios.  The goal of this project is to identify/categorize toxicological endpoints along a pathophysiological continuum.  This will serve as preliminary work for the development of a pathophysiological  progression model to characterize toxicity endpoints used in human health assessments. An endpoint is defined in this document as an objective or subjective (e.g. self reported symptoms in a study using human research subjects) measure that serves as an indicator of a response (normal and/or  pathological) to chemical/toxicant exposure.   A compendium containing the categorization of endpoints along a pathophysiological continuum (from no effect to adverse effect) would serve to do the following: (1) Weigh the relative importance of effects induced by a chemical or across chemicals,  (2) Provide information valuable in the determination of species sensitivity and relevance of animal effects to humans, (3) Provide interpretative, descriptive and graphical information that can aid in the standardization and uniformity of chemical health assessments, and (4) Serve as a reference  source for chemical-mode of action (MOA) characterization. Tasks The contractor shall complete the tasks below in accordance with the delivery schedule. Task 1.   Preparation of Joint Quality Management (JQM)/Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  The contractor shall prepare, submit and adhere  to a (JQM/QAPP) specifically designed for this requirement in accordance with the template in Appendix A.  The JQM/QAPP shall be submitted to the EPA Project Officer for review and approval.  Task 2.   Identify the most prominent critical effects available in chemical assessment databases The  Contractor shall search chemical toxicity assessment databases, identifying the critical effects within those assessments, and deriving a list of those biological endpoints used as critical effects, (i.e., those toxicological endpoints on which the assessment is based).  A severity categorization  report (attached) is provided as an example of similar type of database analysis and integration. Task 3.   Populate the Pathophysiological Progression Model diagram with the endpoints obtained from task 2, and elaborate on alternative severity categorization paradigms The contractor shall place  the critical effects identified in task 2 along a severity continuum using the Pathophysiological Progression Model (Figure 1). The Pathophysiological Progression Model shall be used as the model to be populated with the critical endpoints selected from the chemical toxicity databases.  The  contractor shall proceed to provide scientific rationale for the placement of specific critical endpoints along this diagram. (Figure 1) Pathophysiological Progression Model Task 4.   Provide a series of charts with detailed information on the endpoints as in Task 3, and criteria for placement  along the Pathophysiological Progression Model  The contractor shall generate a descriptive elaboration of the rationale for the categorization scheme in task 3, along with tabular and graphical representation of the data.  For example, columns can be generated within tables for critical effects,  temporal or dose association identified, categorization rationale, etc.  Task 5.   Produce a final report with recommendations for further analysis The contractor shall produce a final report describing the approaches used to identify and categorize the critical effects selected along the  Pathophysiological Progression Model.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for further analysis for the development of criteria to characterize pathophysiological processes, and identify data rich pathophysiological processes as candidates for future case study(ies).  Identification and  proposal of alternative severity categorization schemes shall also be addressed.  In summary, the final report shall contain an introduction to the issue, approach used for obtaining and analyzing the information, graphical and tabular representation of the data and recommendations for alternative  approaches and further data analysis Task 6.   Produce an abstract and presentation to be delivered by the EPA at a Scientific Meeting in December 2007. The contractor shall produce a series of slides that summarize the contents of the final report which will be submitted for presentation at  scientific meeting, and used as a general presentation for the Pathophysiological Progression Project.  Travel by contractor staff will be required in support of this task.  The travel location will be determined at a later date.  The travel location will be in the U.S.  Upon completion of the  travel, the contractor shall generate and submit to the PO, a detailed Contractor Travel Report, within (5) working days of completing the travel. DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE The Contractor shall provide written products to the Project Officer as specified in the above tasks.  All products must be of  high quality, written in a clear concise style, with a logical organization and presentation.  Products not adhering to these standards or substantially lacking scientific quality will not be accepted.  The Contractor shall provide all written materials and responses in both hard copy and  electronic format. Hard copies of all completed text, tables, and figures shall be submitted to Project Officer for review and approval.  Authors shall also submit word processing disks or email electronic files.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for data, materials, and support for several projects currently being conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL).  The following projects would be supported by this service: The FY06 Office of Research and Development (ORD) Pilot: Bioavailability and bioaccessibility of arsenic in soil, the EPA/NERL's collaboration with the National Risk Management Research Laboratory on the Chromated Copper Arsenate dislodgeable coatings research,  and the EPA/NERL's toxic element bioavailability research.     This action is being pursued on a sole source basis.  Ohio State University (OSU) has unique soil samples necessary to provide comparability with our research in EPA/NERL and is the only source for these unique soils.  OSU is the only  source for the twenty-one soils used in Bradham et al., 2006, Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 25(3): 769-775.  The soils are unique because the soils were statistically pre-selected for a wide range of soil properties, individually amended with the same total concentration of arsenic (250  mg/kg), lead (2000 mg/kg), and cadmium (50 and 300 mg/kg) , and were aged for a several months following amendment.  Failure to obtain the OSU's unique materials and expertise will directly impact the development and verification of the EPA/NERL's in-house toxic element research.    NAICS Code  541710 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely  submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA,  Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD), Patuxent River, Maryland intends to contract on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the University of California at Riverside, California (UCR) for engineering support  which will result in a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for Particulate Emissions (PM) Testing for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.

Recent changes to the United States Clean Air Act (CAA) requires accurate estimates of size, distribution, and chemical species of particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter emitted from military aircraft.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided guidance on the development of an interim Particulate Matter (PM) test method for the JSF that is more accurate, less expensive and less time consuming than the EPA Method 5 currently employed. Specifically, the QAPP for PM Testing for the JSF and other military aircraft must be approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be in compliance with the CAA.  The QAPP must meet all requirements specified in “EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans,” EPA/240/B-01/003, March 2001 (QA/R-5).  

UCR has previously developed compliant QAPPs for both the EPA and the California Air Resources Board and has been an active participant in EPA supported state-of-the-science PM testing.  The Navy will benefit from unique lessons learned from all testing previously performed by UCR in development of QAPPs with cross applicability to the Navy’s requirement.  The cost to bring another contractor up to speed on this effort, from the ground up, would be prohibitive and is not expected to be recovered via competition.   The required delivery date for an EPA approved QAPP is April 2007.   The estimated value of this procurement is less than $80,000. 

Numbered Note 7 applies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with BOC Edwards, Inc., Wilmington, MA 01887 for the purchase of up to 15 Mobile High Vacuum Turbo Pumping Systems (carts) (if all options exercised).  Sole source determination is based primarily on the need for a common interface that is used throughout the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) facility. NIST currently maintains an inventory of approximately sixty carts that were originally procured on a competitive basis.  These carts contain unique features that include a complete mobility of the system including frame – mounted components and a relay box. The relay box is a unique safety feature that protects not only the operator, but the system itself and equipment it is connected to as well. Operation of the system is achieved by single button control.    BOC Edwards is the sole manufacturer of the equipment which includes unique capabilities that are required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

As defined in the federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333911, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by 
21 August 2006.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Appropriate Technical Resources, Inc. in Laurel, MD to furnish, deliver, and install at the USDA, ARS, NAA, U.S. Plant, Soil & Nutrition Lab, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York, for an Sixfors Bioreactor System with Six Vessel, components, accessories, and System Software. The system also includes shipping (F.O.B. Destination), standard warranty on the equipment, installation and training.  This system will be used to analyze bacterial responses to difference culturing conditions. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The Sixfors is designed to operate 6 reactor vessels from one compact control unit, which is important because of the limited laboratory space available. Due to restricted laboratory space, the system footprint must be no greater than 3 foot by 2 foot.  The system allows for monitoring and the ability to control conditions in each vessel independently. With six reactors, we can compare two conditions X three biological replicas, the minimum required for a typical experiment. The system also permits us to use as many or as few of the reactors as needed, allows us to conduct different experiments that begin at different times, and allows for the use of culture volumes as low as 80ml, which is important when expensive culture components are used so that we can use less of these components. Our selection of this instrument is based on our research on the Internet, contacts with salespeople, and inquiries to other laboratories that use bioreactors. Our information has shown that while other systems satisfy some of our specifications, only the Sixfors system sold by ATR, Inc is able to satisfy all of our specifications.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company's and systems' capabilities, available service agreements and consumables (including price lists) to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation is available.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Bio-Rad Laboratories in Hercules, CA to furnish and deliver, F.O.B. Destination, to the USDA, ARS, NAA, U.S. Plant, Soil & Nutrition Lab, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York, for an iQ5, Real–Time PCR System, Laptop Computer and accessories, and System Software. The system also includes shipping, a one year parts and labor warranty on the equipment and an extended warranty on the PCR System.  This system will be used to determine gene expression levels and is critical for the study of plant-pathogen interactions.  DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The Bio-RAD IQ5 is designed to perform and analyze 96 quantitative RT-PCR reactions.  This system has the unique capacity to 1) operate in a thermal gradient mode, which is essential for optimizing reaction conditions especially in multiplex reactions. 2) Provide thermal block ramp rates that heat at least 3C/sec and cool at 2.0 C/sec. Rapid ramp time is important for increasing throughput by decreasing elapsed run time. 3) Maintain block temperatures within 0.3 degrees C of the programmed temperature and with no more than plus/equal to 0.4 degrees C variation between wells.  These tolerances are important because qRT-PCR analysis requires a high degree of accuracy in thermal cycling in order to achieve reproducible results. 4) The ability to be used as a stand-alone thermocycler. This is necessary to prolong the useful life of the equipment.  5) True 5 color multiplexing is required to allow simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of five genes.  This is necessary for increasing throughput and reliability of quantitation by providing internal controls.  6) The instrument must be open platform, which will allow use of reagents from other suppliers, which will reduce the cost of reactions by allowing competition for reagents.  7) The data format is fully documented.  Data outputs are required to be standardized so that they will be exportable into custom analysis and data management software.  Our research (e.g., catalog search, internet search and meetings with sales representatives) has shown that while other systems satisfy some of our specifications, only the Bio-Rad IQ5 system sold by Bio-Rad Laboratories is able to satisfy all of our specifications.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company' and systems' capabilities, available service agreements and consumables (including price lists) to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation is available.

Night flight operations require at least one rotor blade tip light be functional.  The tip lights illuminate rotor arc situational awareness.  The current wired tip light has poor reliability because the power wire running the length of the blade fails due to the affect of centrifugal force.  A wireless tip cap light is needed that will eliminate these problems.  A wireless system must be able to be turned on and off and can not adversely affect the blade weigh and balance.  Boeing will evaluate existing technology such as motion activated, motion powered - faraday lights, LED's, Piesoelectric crystals, VHF/UHF wireless remote systems for possible application on the CH-46E rotor blade.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The estimated period of performance for this effort is 1 October 2006 through 31 March 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a level of effort, time and materials order for the procurement of a paint system used to detect cracks in the rotorhead on the CH-46E series helicopter.  Safe operations depend on visual inspections to ensure the aircraft is safe to fly.  Recent discovery of a cracked rotorhead during preflight inspection reinforces the need to develop paint systems specifically formulated to produce easily identifiable visual indications when a crack in the base metal occurs.  This effort will involve the research, identification, and testing of rotorhead candidate paints for the purpose of providing test coupons and the testing of up to three alternative paint formulas.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation Group has a requirement for ruggedized computers that are being used for Flight Testing and are used to satisfy a multifaceted set of requirements that allow various components to be configured together to satisfy airborne test requirements.  The ruggedized mobile computer test system (Panasonic Toughbook 29) Ruggedized Portable Computer. 2.5”high, 11.8” wide, 9.5” deep, with the following options: 60GB hard drive, 1GB RAM, Extra Lithium Ion Battery, Toughmate Universal Black case, DVD Multidrive,  is being used to replace existing Panasonic Toughbooks currently in use on various U.S. Navy aircraft test programs.  These systems are required to be the same form, fit and function as the existing computers so that they can directly replace computers currently in use on aircraft.  These ruggedized, portable computers are used as a physical part of instrumentation systems that are installed onboard aircraft and taken into other harsh environments such as onboard aircraft carriers.  Due to factors such as shock, vibration, and moisture in these environments, normal portable computer systems would be easily damaged and would not adequately perform the functions required.  Switching to a different ruggedized mobile computer would be time and cost prohibitive because of the time and cost involved in retrofitting aircraft mechanical and electrical interfaces.  This would add cost and cause major delays in flight test programs. The government intends to procure this equipment from Toughbook Sales.com, 11660 Alpharetta Hwy #355, Roswell GA, 30076.  All capabilities statements received by 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time, 31 Aug 2006, will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.  Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of capabilities of the alternate equipment.

The government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.

For information regarding this procurement contact Betty Goddard, elizabeth.goddard@navy.mil, (301) 757-9719.

The facility receiving the equipment has an existing inventory of Olympus scopes in good working condition which would have to be replaced were any other manufacturers products procured, therefore, the Government would incur a significant duplication of cost to purchase the scope from another manufacturer.  In addition, the Olympus scope has the widest field of view known of any current scopes on the market.  Their 170 degree field of view colonoscopes provide the ability to compare a substantially larger amount of tissue at the same time without repositioning the scope.

This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small  Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.  All capability statements received within 7 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to include capabilities to provide sufficient quantities.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Work or Adobe PDF attachment to Sandra A. Musgrove at samusgrove@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Statements are due by 1600 (4:00 PM) Eastern Time 15 August 06.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to construct a two-story addition to the eastern portion of B-Wing in existing Building E3549 (Berger Laboratory) in the Edgewood Area (EA) of Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) in Maryland.  The proposed construction consis ts of an approximately 2,185 square foot (SF) two-story addition on the southern exterior wall of B-Wing.  With respect to the existing B-Wing façade, the addition is almost 100 feet across by 18 feet out from the existing exterior wall.   The project also involves the renovation and conversion of approximately 1,825 SF of the existing B-Wing, including 900 SF on the second floor porch.  Completed design for the proposed addition calls for a two-story pile supported steel framed structure wi th slab-on-grade on the first floor and a composite concrete and steel deck floor on the second floor supported by bar joists.  The roof will consist of an insulated steel deck with a modified bitumen roof membrane supported by steel bar joists.  The exter ior walls will consist of horizontal insulated metal siding panels to match the existing adjacent panels. The project includes limited demolition of the existing B-Wing.  In addition to the above, proposed construction includes site work, helical piles, concrete pile caps, grade beams and floor slabs, rough carpentry, fixed windows with blast curtains for AT/F P, wall and roof insulations, steel doors and frames, wood doors, door hardware, steel studs and furring, gypsum board partitions, carpet on raised concrete access flooring, suspended acoustical ceilings, painting, interior signage, extension of an existin g sprinkler system and fire alarm system, tapping the existing steam heat system for a new steam to steam humidifier serving the new rooftop unit, ductwork, rooftop air handler, DDC electronic controls, electrical distribution underground, interior electri c distribution, and lighting.    The proposed construction calls for one Bid Option  Replacement of the Existing Metasys DDC Control Board in the Office of the Main Mechanical Room of Bldg. E3549 by a Johnson Controls Metasys Network Control Module (NCM-350).  This work includes a point- to-point replacement of all controls on the existing board, controls hook-up of the proposed addition, and programming and testing of all new controls and the installed NCM-350 by a qualified and certified electronics technician.

<DESC>Amendment #A002 (attached) is issued to revise paragraph 2(b) by changing the number of full-time employees from 200 to 150 that vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneousley employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed for a period not less than one (1) year.  Time and date for receipt of offers is changed from August 18, 2006 to September 5, 2006.  It is anticipated that responses to questions will be posted Thursday, August 17, 2006. ------------------------------------------------------------ Since issuance of the Announcement/SIR No. 1 the FAA has received several questions from potential offerors seeking clarification.  Amendment #A001 (attached) to the Announcement/SIR No. 1 is issued extending the scheduled closing date for receipt of offers to August 18, 2006, in order to allow time for consideration of the questions and answers and associated changes.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "3-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluations of Tiers 2 and 3, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns limited to Area VI (AR, LA, NM, CO, OK, and TX).  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide SEDB/8(a) firms.  Tier 3, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "3-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.  If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified from both Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 through 3, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 through 3 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  Experience:   		(a) Document vendor's or predecessors experience with engineering and computer support services as identified in the attached PWS, Section 2, Areas of Effort, for ground-based National Airspace System (NAS) equipment or similar systems and equipment.  Note: A predecessor corporation is a corporation, which has existed in the past, has been replaced by a corporation which exists today, and for which a legal chain of successorship can be documented.  Mergers and acquisition activity accounts for such a predecessor-successor chain among corporations.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information: (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 		(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate an ability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 		(a) Vendors must demonstrate that Contract Manager will be available at the time of contract award that meets the qualifications identified in the PWS.  Documentation as to individual qualification may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  Resume should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), educational background, and training in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and technical or management competence. 		(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 200 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: 1) a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, 2) signed certification with a list of employees with date of employment including employees' managers and the manager's qualifications. 		(c) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate successful recruitment capabilities and competitive employee benefits in order to recruit and retain a highly educated and skilled work force.   	3.  Accounting System and Financial Capability: 		Provide documentation that your company: 			(a) Currently has an "acceptable" job cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards.  Identify your company's accounting system software package.  Provide the date of and the name of the DCAA field office performing the latest accounting systems audit.  Or, agree to obtain or develop a DCAA approved accounting system upon contract award at contractor's expense.  (Note: The FAA will not pay any vouchers from a newly installed system until the new system has been tested by DCAA.)  			(b) Has the financial capacity to support biweekly expenses in the minimum amount of $2,000,000.  (Note: Present contract biweekly voucher expenditures up to $2,000,000 are typical.)

<CONTACT>Sherry Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-874-5144, Fax 202-874-5625, Email sherry.taylor@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the original notice to include the entire text that was intended.

            The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to renew its Microsoft Premier Support cover with Microsoft for the period 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007.  The total estimated cost is approximately $77,000.

OCC’s standard configuration for desktops/notebooks and the server environment currently include, almost exclusively, Microsoft products.  All of our operating systems and primary applications such as Windows 2003/2000, Word, PowerPoint, Access, Excel, Outlook, Internet Explorer, SQL Servers and our electronic mail system, Exchange are Microsoft products.

It is essential to the mission of this agency that we continue to support and ensure the stability of all Microsoft applications on all desktops, notebooks and servers.  Getting answers to problems accurately and quickly is mandatory.  An open problem means that a user or users are not working to their full potential and this is costing the OCC money.

  Microsoft is the sole provider of their Premier Support Agreement and is best positioned to provide support services since they are the developer of these operating systems and applications which OCC is dependent on.  Microsoft Premier Support provides the OCC with several levels of support.  First, they provide access to confidential and priority information only available to Premier customers.  Second, they provide immediate access to second and third level support, within Microsoft; these are subject matter “experts” with a very high level of knowledge in the area in question.  Third, if the issue isn’t resolved by third level support it is escalated to the actual development team that wrote and maintains the code in question.  This agreement gives OCC direct access to Microsoft’s technical and management staff quickly which decreases the agency’s level of risk for long down times and lost data as problems are resolved swiftly.   This direct line of communication also reduces the chances of communication discrepancies that can happen when going through an intermediary source.  Lastly, Microsoft provides access to their Premier web site that provides valuable troubleshooting research and patches, many of which are not available to non-Premier customers or the public.

Microsoft provides a Technical Account Manager (TAM) that proactively monitors our account.  The TAM is a dedicated resource that acts as our eyes and ears in Microsoft, constantly evaluating change, to measure the impact on the OCC’s business.  It is doubtful that a third-party provider would be able to provide this level of involvement or representation between Microsoft and the OCC. 

In the past, OCC has incurred problems that required patches or “hot fixes” as the resolution, the Microsoft Software Developers have written custom hot fixes exclusively for the OCC’s use.  A third party contractor will require more time to answer our issues as they will ultimately have to go directly to Microsoft themselves, on our behalf of course, to get such a patch.  We also risk of the third-party misinterpreting or misrepresenting the issue when they ultimately go to Microsoft as well.  This will only increase OCC’s down-time for the problem.

OCC’s entire network infrastructure is dependent on the Microsoft Windows platform.  It is essential that we maintain our Microsoft Premier Support Agreement to ensure the continued high level of support to OCC’s end users.  Using a third-party provider of support would lead to longer outages or downed systems as there would be an additional layer involved.

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  Written or telephone requests for a solicitation will not be accepted.  A solicitation will not be issued.  All information received with 7 calendar days after the date of this notification that contains pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC .

USAID’s Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance programs in the five Central Asian Republics.   The USAID/CAR portfolio focuses on promoting more effective and democratic governance; advancing economic reforms and expanding economic opportunities—to include energy, water and agricultural activities; and supporting social sector reforms, improving access to quality health and education services, and addressing the threat of infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, and Avian Flu).  The USAID/CAR Mission is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with Country Offices in Tashkent, Dushanbe, Bishkek and Ashgabat.  The USAID/CAR office in Almaty plays the dual role of Regional Headquarters and Country Office for Kazakhstan.  To facilitate this latter role, USAID has established a staff presence in Astana, Kazakhstan.  (Note: The U.S. Embassy will transfer to Astana, which has been the official capital of Kazakhstan since 1998, in September 2006.  

The US has three strategic interests in Kazakhstan:  Security interests to achieve regional stability; economic, democracy, and social reforms to attract and sustain foreign investment and to improve opportunities for the citizens of Kazakhstan to participate openly and effectively in civic life (all of which establish long-term stability); and the development of Central Asia’s very significant energy resources.  Within this overall USG strategy, USAID assistance will focus on the goal of advancing democratic and market economic reforms.  This focus will promote the development of sustainable social services and work on solidifying Kazakhstan’s role as an economic reform leader in Central Asia in order to broaden the benefits of Kazakhstan’s economic growth and energy resources to the other countries of Central Asia.  USAID’s $20 million/year assistance program in Kazakhstan is expected to comprise the following elements: 

	1) Economic Sector:
 
•	Increase Trade and Investment – Assistance to help Kazakhstan to come into compliance with the WTO and increase its trade and transit volumes.

•	Improve Economic Policy and the Business Environment – Assistance for policy reforms to improve and increase transparency in government budget formulation, intergovernmental finance, and management of public expenditures.

•	Improve Private Sector Competitiveness – Assistance will support small and medium enterprise development and growth, which is vital to diversification and broadening the benefits of economic growth.

2) Democracy Sector:  

•	Establish & Ensure Media Freedom & Freedom Of Information – Encourage continued government respect for freedom of association, religion and speech as well as for democratic dissent, and provide legal and other assistance to promote a supportive environment for independent media and civil society organizations.

•	Protect Human Rights – Encourage continued government respect for freedom of association, religion and speech as well as for democratic dissent.

•	Strengthen Civil Society – Cultivate local civic activism on key policy issues at the grassroots level; and facilitate coalition building among NGOs to become better advocates for national level policy reforms.

•	Strengthen Democratic Political Parties – Support Kazakhstan’s efforts to implement changes in the structure of its governing systems that increase accountability and transparency, such as direct elections for local government officials.

3)  Social Sector:   
•	Address Other Health Vulnerabilities/Enhance Health Systems Capacity – Ensure the institutionalization and sustainability of primary health care system reforms related to financing, family medicine, evidence-based medicine, and quality primary health care.  
•	Reduce Transmission and Impact of HIV/AIDS – Technical assistance with implementation of HIV grants from the Global Fund (GFATM), strengthening HIV surveillance, and improving blood safety systems.   

•	Prevent and Control Infectious Diseases of Major Importance – Assist the continued expansion of the DOTS program for TB control within the penitentiary system; maintain work to achieve global targets for treatment success and case detection in selected oblasts; continuation of the multi-drug resistant TB pilot program; improve surveillance systems; and strengthen Government’s ability to respond to emerging threats.  

•	Improve Child Survival, Health, and Nutrition – Technical assistance to improve health services for integrated management of childhood illnesses, including the development of clinical practice guidelines based on international standards and provider training.  

•	Improve Maternal Health and Nutrition – Pilot projects on safe motherhood to demonstrate WHO-recommended strategies for decreasing maternal morbidity and mortality.

<DESC>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is seeking potential sources capable of performing the Integrated Security Services for the Department of Defense in the National capital Region, including the Pentagon.  The Integrated Security Services Contract (ISSC) is a total system approach to automating and improving the physical security system used to protect Department of Defense (DoD) sites including, the Pentagon, and sites within the National Capitol Region (NCR).  ISSC emphasizes the use of computer-based solutions to meet security requirements and integrates the operation of multiple subsystems to improve efficiency and control.  Functions and processes within ISSC are divided into 9 major subsystem categories which are: a) common support systems, b) command, control, & communications systems, c) access control systems, d) intrusion detection systems, e) assessment systems, f) video badging systems, g) Active/Passive barrier systems, h) Security Booths, Kiosks and Bullet Resistant Components (BRC), and i) Screening Devices.  The objective of the ISSC is the design, procurement, installation, training, and maintenance of automated, integrated physical security systems for multiple DoD sites.  The overriding design requirement for each of the computer-based subsystems within ISSC shall use open systems design concepts, which are compatible with existing systems (All renovated space has the AMAG system installed and monitored. Legacy space has a combination of DAQ or MDI brand installed and monitored. When the Pentagon renovation project is completed (estimated 2011) all alarms monitored will be AMAG. Any new alarm system to be installed is currently programmed to be the AMAG brand, current or upgraded).  Open systems are those that conform to open specifications for interfaces, services, and supporting formats.  This conformance enables properly engineered subsystems to be easily integrated into a wide variety of systems with minimal changes to interoperate with other subsystems.  Integration of the various computer-based subsystems shall be accomplished through compliance with standard interfaces defined by standards bodies such as ISO, ANSI, IEEE, and applicable DOD Regulations.  Adherence to this design philosophy is intended to foster the overall objective of effectively and efficiently designing, procuring, installing, operating, and maintaining automated, integrated physical security systems through the benefits of interoperability and scalability.  A Top Secret Facility clearance is required and all personnel will require either a Secret or Top Secret clearance.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals.  All interested offerors need to submit a capabilities statement not to exceed two (2) pages in length. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.     Responses to this notice must be by e-mail.       Responses to this notice are due by August 22, 2006.     Send your response and any questions to chris.carlson.ctr@whs.mil.

<SUBJECT>35 -- Verizon Wireless Equipment
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source delivery order to Verizon Wireless, Inc. to provide wireless equipment to improve wireless calling within a GSA HQ-Fairfax Facility located within the Verizon Wireless system.  The acquisition is for the General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  GSA/FAS OCIO plans to negotiate with Verizon to purchase 2 Donor Antennas; 2 bi-directional amplifiers and 4 coverage antennas as commercial items.  There is a lack of wireless coverage for Verizon cellular and Verizon data (Blackberry) devices in FAS leased space at Fairfax, Virginia. The building is a "green building" and has insulation film on the windows, and foil backing on the ceiling tiles. This severely affects wireless communications to the point of wireless being grossly limited, or non-existent. Most areas in this building do not receive wireless coverage, so Verizon cellular voice and Verizon data (Blackberry) devices are usually inoperable unless the devices are taken outside of the building. The lack of in-building wireless coverage limits communication.  It is not possible to solicit offers from numerous potential sources because the Verizon signal transmission is proprietary and can be obtained from only one vendor, Verizon.  Market research was conducted by the Government.  On the basis of the research, the Government must first obtain permission from the cellular/data carrier to receive and amplify the Verizon  proprietary signals.  The period of performance is delivery within 1 week and maintenance upgrades for one base year, with three, one-year option periods to be exercised at the Government’s discretion [FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, applicable].  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. 1.  List the brand name description of the item being Trend Micro software and technical support. 2. List salient characteristics of the item that cannot be satisfied by another product.  Malicious code in the form of viruses, Trojan Horses, Mass Mailers arrive at Department of State systems in several ways. Including email, browsing the Internet, removable media and security flaws in the operating system to name a few. Protection against this threat is a continuing concern for the Department of State. The Trend Micro products have been in use on mail systems at the Department of State for many years providing proven protection. No other product on the market has this track record. Trend Micro works with the State Department on AntiVinls initiatives to protect Department of State desktop systems. The technical support staff at trend Micro is familiar with the installed systems and the level of support and service we require. No other AntiVirus company has this level of experience with Department of State systems.  Submission of virus samples via HTTPS: Other vendors require the use of email as the submission process. This is important because in the event that the Email system is shutdown for any reason we can still submit virus samples via HTTPS. 4. Describe market surveys conducted to identify sources for the item being Acquired The Virus Incident Response Team (VIRT) conducts continuing market reviews to ensure Department of State systems have current state of the art protection against malicious code. The VIRT keeps abreast of new products and changes in existing products. Providing the best protection available is a core part of the VIRT mission. To this end the VIRT staff reviews magazine articles, independent reviews and Internet resources related to AntiVirus products. Methods used to determine why only the specific product would meet the Government's minimum needs. The AntiVirus program at the Department of State has enjoyed a great deal of success in preventing and eradicating viral attacks. This is in large part due to the AntiVirus products installed. The multi-vendor approach used by the Department has allowed Department of State systems to remain functional and online even when most other government agencies have been shutdown. Trend Micro products have played a key role is making this possible. Altering such a key component could put Department of State systems at risk. 4. Describe why the requested product satisfies the government's needs and why another product cannot.  No software is bug free and any new software introduced in to Department of State networks must be tested to ensure compatibility with existing systems. Experience has shown that do to the nature of AntiVirus software this is especially true for these products. Introducing a new AntiVirus solution would produce unpredictable results. Possibly causing loss of data and man-hours. The VIRT developed installation guidelines and procedures for Trend micro software unique to the Department of State. The VIRT and Enterprise Network Management (ENM) thoroughly tested them in a lab environment. Issues unique to the Department of State were addressed and resolved. The Department of State Configuration Control Board (CCB) reviewed these results, the product of many thousands of man-hours, and they were added to the Software Baseline.

The equipment listed above is required to provide contingency/back-up servers, fault tolerant redundancy, recoverability and availability of our mission critical service of providing remote internet access in the event of a catastrophic failure.   The ONE server infrastructure is a HP Compaq environment, and any deviation to the Compaq server model would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the network to State employees.  The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed.

STATEMENT OF WORK

AS OF August 9, 2006


1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome’s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The current DFAS PBX is a fiber remote off of the AFRL PBX.  The Nortel 61C PBX was shipped from San Bernardino to DAFS Rome.  The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the DFAS San Bernardino Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  The battery backup and rectifier will need to be replaced.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-939, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), to purchase professional services from Dr. Frank Delaglio.  Dr. Delaglio will be training NIH scientists in the use and development of processing and analysis software related to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of proteins and nucleic acids, specifically the NIH packages NMRPipe, NMRDraw, DYNAMO, and TALOS, and oversee the development of appropriate documentation software for these packages by a third party contract.  The goal of the training and documentation is to ensure continued utility of the vast amount of previously developed software, so that it can remain of maximum advantage to the Section on Biophysical NMR (LCP-NIDDK), all other NMR researchers at NIH, and the NMR community at large.   

Background

Research in the Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy Section of the Laboratory of Chemical Physics (LCP) includes the planning and execution of studies in selected areas of chemistry, physics and biology involving the relationship between molecular structure and function on a wide range of systems of biological interest.  Within the LCP there is considerable emphasis on development of new and improved methods for multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and its application to the study of biomolecular structure and dynamics, development of theory for interpreting NMR data, and specific applications in biomolecular structure determination.  In particular, novel experimental NMR approaches employing weakly aligned media are a key focus, as these experiments provide long range orientational information which is a powerful complement to the short range distance and torsion information used in conventional NMR structural studies.  In addition, as more high-resolution structures are made available, database mining approaches to structural analysis become increasingly useful and effective, and this also has been a theme of computational efforts in LCP NMR.  In addition, many NMR methods that are now widely applied to proteins are currently also being adapted in the LCP for precise NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and dynamics, an area which previously has been proven to be problematic.  Recently, the LCP NMR lab has begun investigation on the promising possible advantages of joint use of NMR structural data with overall molecular shape information obtained from solution-state small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering.

Advancement and application of all these NMR methods has depended critically on the development of specialized software with a variety of capabilities, including multidimensional Fourier reconstruction, signal enhancement, multidimensional peak analysis and quantification, analysis and simulation of NMR parameters based on structure, and NMR database-driven homology methods.  Because of the striking volume and diversity of information involved in a typical NMR structural application, there is also a critical graphical design component to this work.  Software facilities must present large amounts of multivariate and multidimensional data graphically, using suitable strategies so that analysis steps which require interactive decision making can be performed quickly and effectively, and meaningful relationships in the data can be revealed clearly.  For the last 15 years, the lab has been involved in the development of an evolving software framework to support all the research efforts of the lab.  On the one hand, this software has served as a platform for rapid proof-of-concept applications in support of new methods.  On the other, this software system has also served as a platform for providing stable, easy to use facilities for application of new NMR methods as they become standardized and more widespread.

The collection of software created in the Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy Section, LCP-NIDDK, over the past 15 years is a component of virtually every project performed in the laboratory.  It is routinely used in all the NIH intramural biomolecular NMR laboratories, and it has become a standard tool for NMR structural biology across the world.

A substantial amount of development effort has been directed at implementing new facilities within the framework of the TCL scripting language.  The scripting language allows new and customized applications to be developed more quickly and flexibly by recombining existing functions.  This has been an effective approach for our own software development in support of specific research goals, including novel methods for protein NMR structure determination without the use of NMR-derived distances.  The current software system includes roughly 60 programs, mostly written in C++ language, with well over on thousand options and settings.  An in-house version of the TCL script interpreter, NMRWish, has been augmented with over 160 commands having ca 500 options and settings, and a library of more than 200 script files.  The scope of the software covers a substantial fraction of all capabilities needed for biomolecular structure determination by NMR.  However, many of these facilities cannot be broadly used, because they were created as part of a particular research-based application, and as such not described in detail for general use.  As the original developer of this software, Dr. Delaglio is uniquely suited to train NIH employees in the design, architecture, and further development of this system, thereby ensuring its long term continued benefit to the government.  

Duties and Responsibilities

The purpose of this contract is to obtain continuity in the maintenance, development, and dissemination of the above described software system along three lines:  support of the lab’s new experimental methods, implementation of the lab’s new computational methods, and further progress towards a comprehensive software environment for all major aspects of biomolecular structure calculation and analysis by NMR.  Because this software is a key component in the plans and research continuity for LCP NMR, it is critical that support and development of the software continues without interruption.
The contractor’s primary responsibility is the training and coaching of scientists in the Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy Section, LCP, in the support and further development of the lab’s NMR software system.  The system is implemented in the C programming language using a bottom-up design, with a combination of stand-alone modules, modules implemented using a UNIX filter paradigm, and extensions implemented in a customized version of the TCL/Tk interpreter.  High-level applications in the system are constructed and coordinated using shell scripts and TCL scripts.  Graphics facilities are implemented in X11, and hard copy output by direct generation of PostScript.  The current version of the software includes over 60 programs and more than 160 script-based applications.  The core signal processing module provides 50 filter-based functions for multidimensional spectral visualization, signal quantification, statistics, optimization, and matrix decomposition, NMR parameter calculation, database manipulation, and molecular structure calculation by simulated annealing.

Principal training and support tasks include the points below:

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing software projects in application of dipolar coupling data and NMR homology approaches to structure calculation, including extension of these methods to nucleic acids.

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing software projects in sequential assignment, including a multispectral interactive system integrated with a computer-assisted approach based on combinatorial optimization via genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing development of improved methods for database-mining approaches to protein backbone chemical shift analysis and prediction, and extend existing chemical shift database methods to protein side-chain analysis.

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing projects in signal enhancement, including use of Filter Diagonalization Methods (FDM), enhanced approaches to Linear Predication (LP) and Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), Multi-way Spectral Decomposition, reconstruction of spectra data with non-conventional sampling schemes (non-linear sampling, projection reconstruction).

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing computational developments for joint use of NMR and small-angle scattering data.

•	Training to allow continuation of general support, maintenance, and dissemination of existing software, including adaptation for new computer hardware, parallel processing facilities, and operating systems, and new spectrometer data formats.

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing general refinements of existing software, including tools for simplified/automated use of processing and analysis protocols that have become routine.
•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing support of lab facilities for use of the software, including configuration of computers and peripherals, user accounts, etc.

•	Training to allow continuation of ongoing support resources for dissemination and exchange of software, data, and documentation, including management of the lab’s web server and lab’s web pages describing the system.

•	Oversee the further development of documentation of the software package, carried out by an outside contract.

The position requires a unique combination of mastery in scientific software design and development, expertise in numerical methods, and a thorough knowledge of the biomolecular NMR processing and analysis system currently in use in the Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy Section, LCP.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-950, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334517 and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has a requirement to purchase a current state-of-the-art technology small-angle X-ray scattering instrument.  This instrument will function as an intra-institute resource shared by the Sections on Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy, and the Section on Protein NMR, LCP/NIDDK.  Small-and wide angle scattering is capable of providing structural information at physiological-like (solution) conditions for biomolecules varying in size from several kDa to several thousand kDa.  Sample preparation for scattering studies is relatively straightforward, data acquisition is fast, and the information content within a fixed resolution range increases with the size of the system.  Thus, X-ray solution scattering is in a unique position of being both compatible and complementary with respect to high-resolution solution-state NMR.  A joint application of NMR and small-angle solution scattering is well suited to study, simultaneously and under native conditions, macromolecular structure, dynamics, as well as interactions between the macromolecule and the surrounding solvent.  Particularly promising applications include large and multi-domain macromolecules, and assemblies of inherently flexible or disordered macromolecules.  The resolution range of the instrument will allow studying systems at length scales ranging from 1 to 100 nm.  Specific areas of application that will gain most from the availability of an in-house scattering instrument include:

A.	Large and multi-domain proteins and tight macromolecular complexes.  NMR-only studies of such systems are hampered by the decrease in spectral quality with larger size and by scarcity of experimental data defining relative position of the individual domains.  Scattering data provides long-range translational restraints that complement global orientational restraints from NMR such as RDCs.

B.	Large oligonucleotides.  The constraint that scattering data provides on the overall shape of the RNA constructs will be especially valuable as NMR distance restraints are limited to the intra- and inter-strand neighbors and RDCs are difficult to acquire.

C.	Micelle-solubilized membrane proteins.  Solution scattering data will provide information on the shape of both membrane-embedded protein and that of the micelle itself.

Sample volume of 20 ƒÝL or less is required for the measurement.  At least 2 of each capillary sample cells with the diameters of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm each that will be provided with the system.  At least 2 flat cells with a path length o 0.7-1.5 mm will also be included with the system.  Temperature control unit will allow a capability of maintaining sample cell temperature in the range between +5oC and +60oC with sample cell temperature variations not exceeding 0.2oC once the set temperature is reached.  Variation of the cell temperature shall not exceed 0.02oC with a 1oC change of the room temperature.  Temperature adjustments of 10oC within this range should be obtained in 15 minutes or less.  The vendor shall provide a mounted standard (such as silver behenate) for conversion between detector pixel coordinates and the q axis and determination of the incident beam center within the detector plane.  The instrument shall include a mounted standard for absolute calibration of the scattering intensity such as glassy carbon.






4.	Sample-to-Detector Coupling

Describe sample-to-detector coupling, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The instrument shall allow acquisition of the scattering data in the scattering vector range between qmin = 0.007 A-1 or smaller and qmax = 0.800 A-1 or larger, free of full or partial masking by any instrument components.  Here q=4*ƒà*sin(ƒ¢ƒá)/ƒÜ, where 2ƒá is the scattering angle and ƒÜ is the incident radiation wavelength.  Such range may be achieved by a user-variable setting for the sample-to-detector distance with the center of the detector offset by no more than 5 mm from the incident beam at each of these settings.  Such variable sample-to-detector distance will necessitate a multi-section evacuated flight path between the sample compartment and the detector that will not introduce any detector masking within the q range listed above.  The individual sections of such path shall be supported by movable independent metal supports rigidly fixable on the mounting table.

5.	Detector

Describe detector, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The vendor shall provide all necessary hardware and software for correction of the raw detector image for geometric distortions and local variations in the detector efficiency.  The output of the detector should be convertible to the ACSII format with the raw number of counts at each detection element. The instrument will include a device for measurement, monitoring, and integration of beam intensity at zero scattering angle transmitted through the sample compartment independent of the data acquisition.  Acceptable devices include a semi-transparent attenuating beam stop with transmitted intensity measured by the main 2D detector, or a separate beam stop-mounted sensor.

6.	Other System Components

Describe other system components, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The contractor will supply interchangeable beam stops with diameters of ~3 and ~4 mm.  Beam stop positioning mechanism will allow adjustment in two dimensions perpendicular to the beam path with a precision of 10 ƒÝm or less.  The instrument shall include a vacuum pump system capable of lowering air pressure within flight-path from atmospheric to <0.03 mBar in less than 15 min at any setting of the sample-to-detector distance if such variable sample-to-detector setup is employed.  The instrument shall be equipped with a computer control console, interfaced to all instrument electronics, equipped with the software for script-driven data collection setup, data correction from any smearing or distortion effects, radial and azimuthal integration, and sample-buffer subtraction. Data collection control scripts should allow for user-programmable sample holder translation perpendicular to the beam path, shutter opening and closing, specification of variable acquisition time of up to 12 hours, and setting a cell temperature prior to data acquisition with an option to postpone acquisition before a set temperature tolerance is met.  Additional computer systems requirements are:  hard drive storage of at least 100 GB unformatted, at least 2 USB-2 ports, Ethernet TCP/IP connectivity.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH TEST BRANCH DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM ASSEMBLY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions asked before the due date. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions asked before the due date.  1. Question: Do you want diagnostic checkout of all I/O channels prior to shipping? Diagnostic checkout requires software to be installed on the PXI-8105.  Answer: Full diagnostic checkout of all I/O channels not required. Power on off the system's chassis, boot up the processor and evaluate condition of the hard drive and RAM and use NI set up utilities to verify the board is detected by the system.  2. Question: If diagnostics are to be performed the software that is installed will depend on which programming language is used for the final application. If this application is LabVIEW it is recommended that we include LabVIEW licenses in the quotation and install LabVIEW, National Instruments drivers (MAX), and create a diagnostic screen in LabVIEW for testing all I/O. If the final software is a compiled executable or runtime system then we can install just the National Instruments drivers  (MAX) and create an executable for a diagnostic screen to test all I/O.  Answer: N/A  3. Question: Should additional software like Microsoft Office or Antivirus software be quoted and installed on the PXI-8105?  Answer: No additional software is required.  4. Question: Is there any formal registration or intent-to-bid process that we need to file in advance of submitting our quotation? We have done business with the government previously and have an active CAGE code, DUNS number, etc.  Answer: Your company must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). The web page is http://www.ccr.gov/ . You must use the Nasa Acquisition Internet System (NAIS) to submit your bid.  5. Question: Would NASA/George C. Marshall Space Flight Center prefer to receive the systems in staged deliveries or all 11 systems in a single shipment?  Answer: Staged delivery to allow for immediate system set-up and acceptance is preferred. 6. We understand that the RFQ specifies 11 systems. The online RFQ submission page contains a field for the unit price. Should the value entered in this field be the price per system or for the entire contract (11 systems)?  Answer: Quote the total price on the front page and use the "Add Additional Information" button to break down each individual system's cost.  7: Question: What is the preferred milestone payment schedule for this project?  Answer:  Partial payment on delivery of 1st unit  Some time period for MSFC to evaluate and accept the unit. If no problems, vendor proceeds with fabrication of remaining units.  Partial payment with delivery of units 2, 3 and 4  Partial payment with delivery of units 5, 6 and 7  Final payment with delivery of units 8, 9, 10 and 11  8. Question: Should the acceptance test be held at the customer or vendor facility?  Answer: The acceptance test will be performed at MSFC. MSFC will be glad to confer with the vendor before shipment should any questions arise.  9.Question: Regarding the parts list in 121461-OTHER-001-001.doc, do we have to use the exact parts listed for the rack components?  Answer: Use the parts listed.  10. Are we still just to quote the one system on the Online RFQ – I know there are 11 systems however wasn’t sure about how we should quote with that only stating one.  Answer: See answer on line 6.  11. Question: Is there anyway we will be able to meet in person with the decision makers for this project before or after we submit our proposal to discuss our company capabilities and similar projects. I am aware that price is one of the factors but I also know that quality and capability our important and we would like to show you these in person if feasible.  Answer: No. Please provide sufficient details about your company and the items you are proposing to show that you can meet the Government requirement.

25.  In the past while installing paint booths for the Air Force, a 100FPM was dictated by the Air Force.  
A-  The reason we’re showing 125 is to allow for enough air movement through filters and change filters once 100 FPM is reached.  100 FPM is the minimum requirement.

26.  What type of roof is there where the exhaust fan goes out.  Is it a built-up or a standing seam metal roof (metal).  If it is a standing seal metal roof, what is the pitch?

A-  The drying booth can be connected to the main booth (that’s what the tunnel is), and we need a door to separate both areas.  That’s why we have more than one exhaust stack.

45.  Do you want us to run CA & BA lines into the booth? 
A-  As per SOW, we need two compressed air drops in the booth and a breathing air box with two connections.

An addendum to this provision is app licable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar cor responding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Id entification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prio r notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excludin g federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holid ays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contracto r should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time fo r commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request th at the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped, searched, label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inches in height and that they will require access  to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Cha rlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the con tractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gat e (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes spec ifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contr actor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visit ors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to  Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The vis itors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary prog ram.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to t he contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge,  the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract) , the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the  FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excus e timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAG PC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification bad ge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued .  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.21 2-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain va lid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contractin g Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.  Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DF ARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.
