<DESC>The fundamental objectives of the Mobilizing Action Against Corruption (MAAC) activity are to reduce corruption by:  1) providing Armenians with opportunities that would enable them to help combat corrupt practices that they encounter, 2) changing social attitudes and behavior among youth and adults to help them become attuned to the consequences of corruption and more likely to oppose or confront corruption, and 3) enabling systems-level changes to prevent or reduce corruption.  The MAAC aims to fill some of the gaps in USAID, other donor, and Government of Armenia (GOAM) anti-corruption programming by attacking corruption from both the demand side by working with civil society and the supply side by working with targeted government agencies. 
The MAAC is a 5 year activity, including three base years and two option years, with an estimated budget of $8 to $9.9 million.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The applicable NAICS code is 481211 and the Small Business size standard is 1,500 employees.  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Part 13 and Part 12, Commercial Items. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-12.  Solicitation No. DTRS57-06-Q-80025 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to collect source noise information for aircraft currently flying in the National Parks.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  Background:  Congress passed the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 (The Act) to regulate commercial air tour operations over units of the National Park System.  The Act directed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the cooperation of the National Park Service (NPS), to develop Air Tour Management Plans (ATMP) for all National Parks with commercial air tours.  The Volpe Center Acoustics Facility (VCAF) is providing technical support to the FAA and NPS during the development of the ATMPs.  It is expected that a part of this support will involve the modeling of potential aircraft noise impacts in several national parks using the FAA?s Integrated Noise Model (INM).  In order to undertake this modeling, it is necessary for VCAF to collect source noise information for aircraft currently flying in the national parks.  The Dornier 228 (D228) and Dornier 328 (D328) are two of these aircraft and will be chartered for flight-testing at Sun Valley Airport in Bullhead, Arizona.  Tasks:  Task 1a:  Install VCAF antennas on D228 and D328 - The contractor must have an operational D228 and D328 airplane in its fleet.  VCAF will require the installation of its Differential Global Positioning System (dGPS) GPS and radio antennas and coaxial cabling on the D228 and a D328 before January 20, 2006.  These antennas will be made available to the contractor by VCAF and make possible the physical tracking of the aircraft during testing.  Installation costs for these antennas and cables may vary, depending on the condition of the aircraft.  VCAF estimates a maximum of 16 hours of a mechanic?s time will be necessary for this avionics work.  Task 1b:  Allow VCAF the use of existing Dornier 228 and Dornier 328 antennas VCAF understands that the D228 and D328 are rare aircraft, and the contractor may not be willing to attach the VCAF antennas to the skin of its aircraft for maintenance and safety reasons, making Task 1 impossible to fulfill.  That said, if the contractor is not willing to attach the VCAF antennas to its D228 or D328, VCAF is willing to make an attempt at utilizing the existing antennas on the D228 and D328 aircraft in the operation of its dGPS system.  To this purpose, VCAF would like to send a technician to the contractor?s property to attach the dGPS system components to the existing antennas and test for functionality.  This visit would require that the contractor perform some avionics work on the aircraft to make the existing GPS antenna cable and the existing radio antenna cable available for attachment to the dGPS equipment.  Labor costs for this cable readiness work may vary, depending on the condition of the aircraft.  VCAF estimates a maximum of 16 hours of a mechanic?s time will be necessary for this preparation and testing.  Once the dGPS equipment is attached to the existing antenna cables, the VCAF technician will test the functionality of the D228 and D328 antennas with the dGPS system.  This test would take approximately two hours on each aircraft.  This test must be performed during aircraft down time so that VCAF will not incur flight charges during the test. The VCAF technician is flexible about scheduling the appointment on the contractor?s property:  The visit would take place either on the weekend of December 9-10, 2006, or the weekend of December 16-17, 2006, at any time between 7 AM and 10 PM local time.  The exact date and time can be determined after the contract award. NOTE:  If the contractor is not willing to attach VCAF antennas to the D228 and D328, and the existing antennas do not function properly after the existing antenna functionality test, VCAF will abandon the use of its dGPS system and resort to a video tracking-based method of aircraft location measurement.  Task 2:  Participate in INM Noise Measurements at Sun Valley Airport - VCAF will require exclusive use of a D228 aircraft and pilot and a D328 aircraft and pilot on Saturday, January 20, 2007, at Sun Valley Airport (A20) in Bullhead City, AZ.  D228 - The contractor will: (1) make ready a D228 aircraft for the VCAF measurement by installing the VCAF antennas, making the existing antenna cables available to VCAF technicians, or determining that no antenna functions are available, according to the instructions in Task 1; (2) send a chartered pilot with a D228 aircraft to Sun Valley Airport at 7:30 AM on the assigned day of testing; (3) meet with the test conductors on the ground and understand the procedures required for the test period; (4) take as passenger a flight test monitor who will observe the aircraft?s position and keep in close communication with the pilot about the aircraft?s position during the testing; (5) become airborne and perform a planned series of level flyovers, simulated takeoffs, and approaches over a microphone array, keeping in contact with the test conductors on the ground; and (6) land the aircraft and consult with the test conductors in a debrief meeting.  This schedule will require use of the D228 for no more than 5 hours at Sun Valley and 2 hours? transit time.  D328 ? The contractor will: (1) make ready a D328 aircraft for the VCAF measurement by installing the VCAF antennas, making the existing antenna cables available to VCAF technicians, or determining that no antenna functions are available, according to the instructions in Task 1; (2) send a chartered pilot with a D328 aircraft to Sun Valley Airport at 12:30 PM on the assigned day of testing; (3) meet with the test conductors on the ground and understand the procedures required for the test period; (4) take as passenger a flight test monitor who will observe the aircraft?s position and keep in close communication with the pilot about the aircraft?s position during the testing; (5) become airborne and perform a planned series of level flyovers, simulated takeoffs, and approaches over a microphone array, keeping in contact with the test conductors on the ground; and (6) land the aircraft and consult with the test conductors in a debrief meeting.  This schedule will require use of the D328 for no more than 5 hours at Sun Valley and two hours? transit time.  Government Furnished Equipment:  A DM radio antenna with matching BNC RG58CU cable and a Novatel GPS L1 receiver antenna with matching TNC RG58CU cable will be made available to the contractor by VCAF in time to have the antennas and cables attached to the aircraft for the test.  These antennas and cables will be returned to VCAF within 30 days of the completion of the test to the following contact:  Clay Reherman, Environmental Measurement and Modeling Division, RTV-4F, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142.  Schedule:  Task 1a: Antenna arrangements with the contractor will commence according to the instructions in Task 1 as soon as an award is made. Task 1b:  If the existing antennas must be tested for functionality, this functionality testing will occur over a two-hour period on December 9-10, 2006, 7 AM ? 10 PM local time or December 16-17, 2006, 7 AM ? 10 PM local time. At the time of this test, cables leading to the existing antennas must be available for connection to VCAF?s dGPS system.  Task 2:  The flight test will be undertaken in a single day, Saturday, January 20, 2007, at Sun Valley Airport in Bullhead City, AZ.  The D228 test will take place from 7:30 AM ? 12:30 PM, and the D328 test will take place between 12:30 PM and 5:30 PM.  The contractor will be paid for test flight time as well as the required travel time to and from Sun Valley Airport and the contractor?s place of business.  The following field parameters must meet measurement requirements for this test to be conducted successfully:  Wind speed <15 mph, temperature 36oF ? 95oF, relative humidity 20% - 95%, no snow or heavy rain.   In the case of high wind or bad weather, a contingency day has been scheduled for Sunday, January 21, 2007.  Period of Performance: Task 1a:  Date of Award; Task 1b: December 9-10, 2006, or December 16-17, 2006 Task 2: January 20, 2007 (Contingency day scheduled for January 21, 2007).

Anncy Keeler can be reached at 734-439-1511 ext 3372.  Section K(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of  contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.

<DESC>Description

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for the DoD 2007 Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) Program.

Scope:

The technology area of focus in the TMTI program is medical therapeutics.  The general goal of the program is to develop lead candidates for medical treatments and pharmaceuticals that, when administered after exposure to a biological agent, mitigate or curtail the effects of that exposure and sustain forces operating in a biological hazard area.

Purpose:

The products developed in the TMTI are selected to be efficacious against a broad spectrum of agents and amenable to a shortened development timeframe.  It is also expected that these products could be used as rapid and effective medical countermeasures against genetically engineered or emerging biological warfare (BW) threat agents.

This BAA is focused on leveraging partnerships with industry to obtain regulatory approval for broad-based medical countermeasures for novel BW threat agents such as nontraditional or emerging threats and genetically engineered microorganisms.  The countermeasure could be used before clinical symptoms develop to reduce the incidence or progression of the disease following exposure to the agent or after clinical symptoms develop to treat the disease or disease process.  It is anticipated that this BAA would generate broad-spectrum countermeasures directed against classes of biothreat agents or directed toward host responses.  The model systems of interest include intracellular bacterial pathogens and hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Solicitation Approach and Overview:

Approaches to the objectives of the TMTI program include evaluating drugs/biologics for efficacy against common structural elements and/or virulence mechanisms of specific agents or classes of agents, or against primary or common host pathways/networks that respond to pathogenic events resulting from exposure to these agents.  These approaches encourage the evaluation of currently FDA licensed and marketed drugs/biologics and drugs/biologics still in the development pipeline, either approaching Investigational New Drug (IND) filing or in clinical development.  Another important consideration is a more expedient approach and/or a shorter timeline to regulatory approval for a potential product.

This BAA seeks optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within the TMTI program as outlined in the BAA.  The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to technology topics.

Acquisition and assistance instruments that will be considered for use for award include Procurement Contracts and Other Transaction Agreements.  The government does not intend to award grants under this solicitation.  All other pertinent information can be found in the BAA solicitation document.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation w!  ill contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather inf!  ormation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the offici al version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam!

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested for the solicitation number NOI7019.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure a Chromatography System and accessories from the manufacture GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.  Item/Description/Quantity: 1) AKTA Explorer 100A, qty-1; 2) Fraction Collector 950, qty-1, and 3) CU-950 Kit, qty-1.  The AKTA Explorer  is proposed as a sole source purchase on the basis that NIH Laboratory already owns four identical systems, which are shared with post-docs whose users have knowledge on how to use the equipment and the software package that is included with the system.  The systems are in use 100% of the time imposing constraints with experiments being delayed because of not enough systems to handle all of the experiments.  There is a significant need for an additional AKTA Explorer 100A chromatography system to be able to 1) thoroughly develop purification processes that provide the highest quality and quantity of product, 2) provide access to post-docs for professional development, and 3) provide some redundancy for when we experience equipment failure.  The AKTA Explorer 100A chromatography system is a critical instrument for development of purification processes that meet the requirements of current industrial purification standards.  The system range in flow rates that permits both small scale and pilot plant scale development work, and enables the automated screening of up to 8 chromatography resins in parallel to moderate throughput studies on the effects of buffer concentrations such as pH and conductivity on purification.  It allows a fast use method and process development and scale-up for proteins, peptides and nucleic acids.   It is designed for all chromatographic techniques employed in method and process development, offering microgram to gram scale purification.  A high level of automation is achieved through UNICORN control software.  A method wizard minimizes preparation run-time and repetitive task while retaining flexibility for easy manual operation.  Samples can be applied at flow rates up to 50 ml/min and fractions can be collected without spillage at flow rates up to 100 ml/min.  The FRAC-950 offers two independent ways of preventing sample loss and the highest flexibility in the choice of collection mode.  Fractions are collected in microplates (over 384 fractions, up to 2.5ml per fraction), a variety of test tube sizes (up to 250ml per fraction).  Different fraction sizes can be collected during different stages of a separation.  In standard fraction collections mode, fractions can be collected in 96-well microplates (up to four) and 12, 18 and 30 mm standards tubes.  Warranty from date of shipment for period of one year.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) warranty, and 3) technical capability to meet required specifications.  Place of delivery NIH/NIAID, Rockville, Maryland 20852.  The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes.  It is not an indication the Government will contract for the services contained in the RFI.  The Government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.   


In preparation for a future acquisition, Air Force District Washington/A7KS is performing ?market research? to determine potential businesses that can perform all of the tasks listed in the ?DRAFT? performance work statement. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the attached draft Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) in establishing performance measures and to obtain responses from questions below.   

This posting constitutes the Department of the Air Force notice of its desire to identify parties interested in providing services to the U.S. Air Force to develop and manage an Air Force Trademark Strategic Marketing and Licensing Program.  The Air Force, pursuant to 10 USC ? 2260, is authorized to license marks and use the royalties generated under the licenses for the purposes of obtaining trademark registrations and operating the licensing program. Any remaining royalties after the payment of costs associated with obtaining trademark registrations and operating the licensing program shall be used for morale, recreation, and welfare activities. The contractor, as part of the Program, may establish partnerships with prospective licensees who may in turn market goods and services bearing Air Force Marks. Additionally, the contractor may develop the concept of an Air Force Brand. 

Air Force District Washington / A7KS may post a solicitation to award an agreement for trademark licensing services.  The primary duty would be to develop and sustain an Air Force Licensing Program that enhances the U.S. Air Force?s name and reputation and consistently provides quality products at reasonable prices and that strengthens the U.S. Air Force?s trademarks through licensing of the marks. This would be in part accomplished by prospecting for potential licensees that would be willing to enter into royalty-bearing licenses, and in part by administering licenses. The contractor would also be responsible for developing a licensed product quality control program and inspecting licensee for compliance with the program. Additionally, the licensee may establish a program for monitoring the marketplace for infringing activities.

Prior experience in working with the licensing of the U.S. military trademarks will be considered, but not required.  Payment for services will constitute a cost of operating the Air Force?s Program, and will come solely from royalties generated from licensing the Air Force properties.  No Appropriated Funds of the United States will be due and payable under any future contract for these services. The Air Force will actively participate in the development of the licensing program and reserves the right to direct the terms of any licensing agreement, including the royalty rate to be charged.  The Air Force  will also retain final approval authority of the content and appearance for all licensed product. 

Potential sources should provide an electronic copy of a capability statement outlining their company?s capability and capacity to perform the work.  In addition, firms must demonstrate that they have the necessary personnel with demonstrated experience, labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities to support the efforts delineated by the ?DRAFT? Performance Work Statement (PWS).  

This documentation must address, as a minimum, the following: 

(1) prior/current corporate experience performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, organization supported, indication of whether a prime or subcontractor, contract value, point of contact with current telephone number, a brief description of how the contract referenced relates to the trademark licensing services described herein;  

(2) company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location (s), DUNS number, CAGE code, TIN and a statement regarding current small business status (if small business). Company name & address, telephone number, point of contact, business size status, NAICS code(s), small business disadvantaged business status (if any), and GSA contract/schedule number, if applicable, (including Special Item Numbers - SINS) and information (if any) that the above requirements are within scope on.  

To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.  Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.  Interested sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for any award if a solicitation is eventually issued. 

Additionally, responses to the following questions will help the Air Force in preparing a solicitation:

1)	Should the contractor be granted a license to one or more of the Air Force?s marks with the right to grant sublicenses, or should the Air Force directly enter into all license agreements with the entities that will use the marks on their goods and services?

2)	If the contractor is granted a license with the right to sublicense, would the contractor find it to be objectionable if the sublicense agreements state that the Air Force has privity of contract with the sublicensees?

3)	Would it be objectionable to the contractor if the license (including the right to sublicense) from the Air Force is nonexclusive? 

4)	Given that no appropriated funds will be used to compensate the contractor, how should the contractor be compensated?

5)	Should the contractor be compensated out of the initial or up-front royalty, out of minimum or running royalties, or a combination of both?

6)	Should the contractor?s compensation resulting from any particular license with a manufacturer or service provider cease when the license agreement terminates?

7)	What is the average size entity that your company usually works with in trademark licensing?

8)	Is there a minimum size requirement for an entity that must be met before your company will enter into a trademark licensing arrangement?

9)	Is there a minimum size requirement for a proposed trademark licensing arrangement that must be met before your company will enter into a trademark licensing arrangement?

10)	Does your company work with non-profit organizations?

11)	What industries does your company usually work with in the area of trademark licensing services?

12)	Would you be willing to administer existing Air Force trademark license agreements?

13)	How would your organization ensure the quality of Air Force-branded products and services?

14)	What are some of the typical terms and conditions of existing agreements for similar services?

The capability statement package shall be sent via email to Grace.Fontana@bolling.af.mil

Interested respondents having questions with respect to the information requested in the RFI and/or the Performance Work Statement should direct them in writing to Grace Fontana, Contracting Officer at Grace.Fontana@bolling.af.mil.

Request written responses of interest and/or comments no later than 1500 Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday 13 December 2006.   

Questions, interest, and/or comments received after the due date for this RFI will be considered, but may not be responded to.

All communication regarding this RFI, including submissions, should be in writing and submitted in a commonly used format electronically to the contact provided above.  Telephone inquiries, questions, and/or comments shall not be accepted, nor provided a response.  All communication will be posted through FedBizOpps for this Request for Information.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center intends to issue an order to The Madison, a Loews Hotel, for the January Board Meeting of the Access Board.     Service period will be January 8 - January 10, 2007.     The Access Board is a Federal Agency that develops and maintains accessibility requirements that entities with responsibilities under the American with Disabilities Act must meet.     The Board, both because of its members some with disabilities and because it must set a perfect example, can only use hotel space, including individual rooms and meeting rooms that meet or exceed the Board's accessibility guidelines.     Given the sensitivity of this issue, the Board will only use a hotel for meeting and rooms after the Boards staff has checked the hotel for accessibility compliance.     After checking several hotels in the Washington, DC area for accessibility compliance and availability, Access Board staff concluded that The Madison is the only hotel available that meets the unique needs of the Access Board for their meeting and individual room service requirements for this meeting.     Specifically, the hotel has meeting rooms of the size and with accessibility options needed by the Board and sleeping rooms available on the dates needed by the Board (January 8 - 10, 2007).     The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.     All sections of the hotel have been found to meet or exceed the Access Boards standards.     The hotel is centrally located for the participants with great access for individuals with disabilities.     Needs vary but include roll-in showers, hearing impaired, and guide dog services.     NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.     Public Debt Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than Monday, December 11, 2006 by 2:00pm EST.     Affirmative responses shall reference 
ABA-02010-07-0015 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.     Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.     If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be issued to the Marriott Metro Center for these services. 
Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<SUBJECT>H -- Telomere Length and its Genetic Determinants and Risk for Prostate Cancer
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-70012-NV

<CONTACT>Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email dm170b@nih.gov - Renita Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8612, Fax 301-480-0241, Email rs442i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Harvard Medical School, 181 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA  02115 for laboratory services to perform average telomere length assay testing for prostate cancer cases and controls enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial who are also part of the CGEMS whole genome scan.  Telomeres, telomere shortening and telomerase activity have emerged as important factors in prostate carcinogenesis.  Telomere erosion is present in prostate cancer and may also be associated with the generation of chromosomal instability that characterizes this malignancy.  In addition, decreased telomere DNA content in prostate cancer tissues has correlated with time to cancer recurrence.  Until recently, telomere length measurement in large epidemiologic studies has been limited because the standard method (Southern blotting) requires significant quantities of DNA and a substantial time investment.  Telomere length measurements by real-time kinetic quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) are advantageous because they are high-throughput and use a small amount of DNA, making studies of telomere length as a cancer risk factor possible in large studies.  The vendor shall:  1) Analyze average telomere length in 2100 samples in triplicate using a Q- PCR assay (e.g. total 6300 analyses); and 2) Provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement and for repeat duplicates, as needed (allow 5% sample replenishment).  Harvard is the only vendor who can  perform the Q-PCR measurement for this procurement for prostate cancer cases and controls because the results from this study must be comparable to the telomere assay that were performed by Harvard for their ?Nurses Cohort? breast cancer cases and controls.  Both of these studies are part of the Whole Genome Scan Study for genetic determinants of diseases and it is critical for the overall purpose that the results be comparable for telomere length across the prostate cancer and breast cancer case-control series.   The genetic determinants of telomere length data will be evaluated in a pooled analysis of the male controls from the prostate cancer case/control study and in the female controls from the breast cancer case/control study. The genotyping in both studies is being done in a single research laboratory under a separate procurement mechanism. It is essential that the telomere length determinations from both cohorts also be performed in a single laboratory, under identical testing conditions, for the data are to be comparable and for the pooled analysis to be scientifically valid.  To introduce another testing laboratory would be detrimental to the continuity of the research in progress.  The Harvard Medical School is the only vendor known to the OEEB that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiment it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on December 15, 2006. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(9)  FA7000-07-T-0015
(10) December 8/December 15
(17).    The Department of Engineering Mechanics has a requirement for the procurement of a scanning vibrating probe system to monitor electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys to understand the corrosion kinetics in aging aircraft structures.  We currently do not have any system to monitor the corrosion potentials and corrosion current path in aluminum alloys.  This equipment will enhance our capability to monitor corrosion in high strength aluminum alloys.  Corrosion of aging aircraft is a widespread problem in the Air Force?s fleet.  This equipment will add a new dimension to cadet curriculum and USAFA?s research by demonstrating the creation of electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys in a liquid electrolyte. Quantification of the current and its path will help us determine the kinetics of the reaction.  This instrument will become an integral part of corrosion demonstration for cadets of EM350, EM445 and EM460 classes.  This will also enable us to develop scientific basis for establishing inspection intervals to monitor corrosion in aging aircrafts.  

We are interested in procuring Model SVP100 system consisting of model SVP370 probe, model ECW370 system controller, model 283 potentiostat/galvanostat, GPIB connector and software from Princeton Applied Research, because of the state of the art instrumentation and controls available in this system.  However any equivalent or better system meeting the following specs will help the Academy accomplish its mission:
 
The scanning vibrating probe equipment should consist of the general capabilities:
?	Be modular in design.
?	Be able to measure the electrochemical activity on specimen non intrusively.
?	Must be completely automated with connections to potentiostat/galvanostat and control computer.

Specific technical requirements are:
?	SVP unit with: 
o	Minimum scanning capability of 12? X 12? in X-Y direction with at least 1 inch travel in z direction.
o	Probe resolution of at least 1 micron.
o	Vibration amplitude of 50 microns or higher.
o	Scanning speed of at least 1mm/sec.
o	Minimum electrochemical sensitivity of 5 ??A/cm2.
o	Lock-in amplifier with amplification of up to 100,000.
o	Minimum SVGA resolution of 800 X 600.

?	Potentiostat/Galvanostat:
o	Fully computer controlled.
o	Minimum sensitivity of 1 pA and 2mV.
o	Scan range of at least 12V and 100 mA.
o	Built in IR compensation.
o	Computer system and related hardware to control the two systems simultaneously.
A  52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal acquisition will be conducted.   This acquisition is unrestricted.  The solicitation will be electronically available through this web site.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) anticipates the issuance of a solicitation for the procurement of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) Instrument in support of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) Project.  It is also anticipated that a Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) will be released on December 6, 2006, with comments due 7 calendar days later. The proposed contract would be for the design, development, fabrication and testing of the OLI Instrument Observatory Integration and Test (I&T), launch site support, and, in addition, a period of sustaining engineering.   The OLI instrument must meet the requirements of all of the OLI technical documents such as the OLI Requirements Document and the Special Test and Calibration Requirements.  It is anticipated that the contract shall be performed at the selected contractor's facility with a basic contract period of performance of approximately 9 years. NASA/GSFC will host an informational meeting for prospective offerors on December 11, 2006 at The Inn and Conference Center at the University of Maryland University College (see the LDCM web site for details, http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov/).  Due to the fact that International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)-sensitive information will be presented at these meeting, attendance shall be limited to U.S. Persons.	Time will be set aside for discussions with the prime contractors and their subcontractors.  There will not be separate discussions for subcontractors.  Appointments for discussions should be scheduled in advance with the LDCM Contracting Officer (see point of contact below).  While this meeting is primarily for OLI instrument offerors and their primary subcontractors because of limited space, current and potential RSDO spacecraft offerors may send a representative. All responsible offerors may propose and have their submissions considered by the Government.  Please note that there may be two people, employed by non-proposing contractors, evaluating technical proposals.  These people shall not have access to any cost, business or past performance data, have signed the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and shall be sequestered from the remainder of the government evaluators. The government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN SUPPORT OF AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY SUPPORT OF TOPSIDE IONOSPHERIC PLASMA MONITOR SENSOR ABOARD THE DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM 
                                                                  The General Services Administration, under a Memorandum of Understanding with the United States Air Force, Air Force Research Laboratory, is seeking sources to provide services supporting the Topside Ionospheric Plasma Monitor Sensor Aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (SSEIS-3) The GSA is soliciting interest for a competitive acquisition from qualified contractors.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.

This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Rather, this Notice is one market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of all potential sources, with specific interest in Small Businesses.  

The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the NAICS Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis.  The NAICS code for this program is NAICS 541990: All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. This size standard for this code is based on average annual receipts of $6,500,000.00 for three (3) most recent completed fiscal years.

The purpose of this announcement is to generate responses from Small Businesses under the NAICS set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph to determine whether the Request for Proposal should be amended as a Total Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR Part 19. 

This Sources Sought Synopsis Notice is issued along with a DRAFT Statement of Work.  The Request for Proposal will be published in FedBizOps on or about November 17, 2006. As stated above, if a sufficient number of Small Businesses (according to the NAICS code assigned to this procurement) express an interest after reading and contemplating the DRAFT Request for Proposal, the Government may restrict competition of the procurement to Small Businesses under the NAICS assigned to this procurement. 
     
Small Business interested in this procurement should provide a response to this Notice.  The response must indicate the level of the contractor?s interest (likelihood you intend to submit a proposal as a prime contractor), potential teaming arrangement if likely to submit a proposal, and contractor qualification information relevant to the Request for Quote.  A brief description of Past Performance information as a prime contractor or a subcontractor providing details is especially important because Past Performance is a significant evaluation factor of the Request for Proposal.  

If an insufficient number of small businesses respond, or if the responses do not indicate small businesses are capable of performing, the solicitation (RFP) may issue unrestricted, i.e., under Full and Open competition.  However, small businesses are not precluded from participating in a Full and Open competition.

Instructions for Responses.  Responses should be not longer than ten (10) pages and must be submitted via email in either Microsoft Word or PDF format.  Please use standard formatting, i.e., 8.5 x 11 inch pages, one inch margins and readable font sizes (not less than 11).   Questions concerning this requirement should be electronically sent to the Contracting Officer, Barbara Brash, barbara.brash@gsa.gov and Wayne Hoover, Customer Account Manager, wayne.hoover@gsa.gov Please limit telephone calls; however, Ms. Brash may be reached at 617.565.6733.

Responses are due no later than 11:00 a.m. EST,  November 13, 2006 and shall be electronically sent to the Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Christine Edwards, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-2182
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The purpose of this amendment is to re-open the Request for Information (RFI) through Friday, January 12, 2007 to allow more firms to submit capability statements.  All submissions should be sent to Paul Kudarauskas via e-mail at kudarauskas.paul@epa.gov.  The RFI is included below in its entirety and is slightly revised. BACKGROUND The National Decontamination Team (NDT) delivers on-site scientific and technical expertise in response to Incidence of National Significance involving environmental contamination and acts of terrorism related to Weapons of Mass  Destruction.  We provide leadership and coordination of decontamination policy, science, and engineering, bridging gaps between research and response.  NDT promotes decontamination readiness through training, exercises, and planning. The NDT joins the force of Special Teams available to support  On-Scene Coordinators.   Located in Cincinnati, Ohio, NDT is dedicated to providing decontamination expertise, especially related to chemical, biological, and radiological contaminants that can be used as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The team provides scientific support and technical  expertise for decontamination of  buildings, building contents,  public infrastructure (including waste/drinking water plants, chemical plants, power plants, food processing facilities and subways), agriculture, and associated environmental media (air, soil and water). Working closely with EPA's  Environmental Response Team (ERT) and the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), the NDT identifies research needs and bridges the gap between research and application of newly developed field tools. LOCATION The NDT is located in Cincinnati, OH.  The contractor services would be  required at emergency response sites. PURPOSE The purpose of this request for information is to determine potential emergency response support sources by acquiring capability statements for the following: contractors that specialize in technologies/methods to decontaminate/treat chemical,  biological, and radiological, contamination for use in the aftermath of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) or an Incident of National Significance (INS).   CAPABILITY STATEMENT A submission from potential emergency response support sources in the form of a capability statement is requested.   Submissions should clearly document the capability to provide technologies/methods for the decontamination/treatment of chemical, biological and/or radiological agents indoors and outdoors on all types of media (water, soil, concrete, non-porous surfaces, electronics, etc.) and structures  (monuments, buildings, subways, airplanes, airports, etc.).  The technologies/methods shall have the ability to decontaminate WMDs such as, but not limited to, Sarin, Ricin, Anthrax, Smallpox, Pandemic/Avian Flu, VX, dirty bombs or Sulfur Mustard.  This list is not all inclusive.  Contractors may  submit decontamination technologies/methods for CBRN agents they specialize in that are not mentioned above.  The contractor shall include the type of agent their technology/expertise will decontaminate and their capability of responding to single or multiple incidents.   The statement shall be no  longer than 10 pages in length, shall explain the decontamination technology and the agent(s) to which the technology is applicable to, and state any real world applications that have proven the technology.  OBJECTIVE The objective of this RFI is to obtain capability statements, based upon the  requirements outlined above, from all (large and small) businesses interested in this possible opportunity.

Description

Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.     
Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization Systems (PARCS).
The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 Apr 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for a geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the PARCS field station located at Cavalier AFS North Dakota. The PARCS provides 24-hour per-day missile warning and space surveillance coverage.  Detects, tracks and reports via data link, real-time earth-impacting objects to the Missile Warning Center or its alternate.  Provides, via data link, real-time metric observations and Space Object Identification (SOI) on tasked earth-orbiting objects to the Space Control Center, or its alternate, and the 1st Space Control Squadron (1SPCS). The PARCS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008). The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years. Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm-Fixed Price with Performance Incentives and a cost-reimbursable logistics CLIN. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for an enhanced blast, main charge explosive that has at least 130% of the performance of an equivalent volume of explosive PBXN-109.  This increased performance should be accompanied by no more than an equivalent percentage increase in cost (equivalent loading cost).  Candidate explosives shall have the following general characteristics.  1) The material shall have the potential to be DoD / Navy explosive qualified.  2)  The material shall have a reasonable booster requirement.  Reasonable is approximately defined as a Large Scale Gap Test result between 150 and 200 cards (data not required).  3) The material shall have a critical thickness of less than 0.3 in (data not required).  4) The material shall be compatible with common plastics and adhesives (data not required).  Any responses to this notice should include the following: company or organization name, brief description of company capabilities, experience areas, history.  This effort shall consist of an initial White Paper response to this Notice, followed by sample testing of candidate materials determined to be viable.   The White Paper shall consist of the following details for each candidate formulation.  1) The explosive formulation, including particle class information.  2) The theoretical maximum density (TMD).  3) The estimated production density.  4) An estimated production cost.  5) A performance estimate and documentation supporting the estimate.  6) A Cheetah model or the information necessary to add the formulation to the Cheetah component library. The Government will perform a review of the responses and down selection of candidate materials determined to be viable.  Organizations with selected explosive formulations will be asked to provide the following samples for testing.  1) Five (5) EA two pound (2 lb) samples loaded in two inch (2 in) diameter, government furnished material (GFM), plastic cylinders, ready for initiation by RP-83 Exploding Bridge Wire (EBWs) detonators.  2) Five (5) EA GFM charge containers of approximately 1300 ml in volume incorporating Detaprime boosters.  The boosters will be provided as GFM if requested. The evaluation of performance will be based on measured total impulse observed on Kulite XT 190 pressure gauges (or similar) in a non-responding internal blast test structure.  The test will be conducted at Government expense.  Participation (charge loading, shipment, travel) in this effort will be at the expense of the participating organizations.  Participating organizations shall supply necessary explosive transportation and associated explosive transportation authorizations. The respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  Interested organizations who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information; point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, duns number, cage code and or tax ID number, as well as size category (large, small, small disadvantaged, etc) a brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals.  Also provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must meet these criteria.  This effort shall progress according to the following schedule.  White Papers responses to this Notice are due on or before 19 January 2007.  Down selection of viable candidates and notification of selected organizations will be performed on or before 1 February 2007.  Selected organizations will be provided with GFM on or before 28 February 2007.  Loaded test samples shall arrive at NSWC Crane on or before 24 May 2007.  Sample testing is scheduled in June 2007. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this response is appreciated.

<DESC>Key Dates:  Responses are due January 5, 2007.       
Responses are to be submitted to Valerie Pickett, Contracting Officer, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations (OLAO), 6011 Executive Boulevard, Suite 529G, Bethesda, MD  20892.  You are encouraged to also submit an electronic response, if available to vp5v@nih.gov.  Questions may be submitted via email to Valerie Pickett at vp5v@nih.gov.  Fax inquiries should be sent to 301-435-6101.  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking expressions of capability and interest from businesses and other organizations that may be capable of providing operational and logistical support for Data Safety and Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) comprised of scientific, statistical, ethical, and other experts assisting the NIH research institutes and centers (ICs) in monitoring the progress and safety of clinical trials.  Services would be provided to the NIH Bethesda, Maryland campus and, potentially, to other locations across the United States.  To date, many of these DSMBs have been managed and provided logistical support by individual ICs.  NIH is exploring the feasibility of providing these management and support functions on an NIH-wide or IC-wide basis through one or more contracts.  This RFI seeks preliminary information on the extent to which these services may be available in the market place.     
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  This request is for capability information and does not constitute a request for proposals.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.     
The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code assigned to this requirement is  561110, Administrative Services.  It is anticipated that if  the Government moves forward with an acquisition it would be for one (1) 12-month period with four (4) 12 month options.     
Background:  The NIH is the world leader in the funding of biomedical research.  It consists of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) and the Office of the Director.  The ICs differ in their mandated health missions and the areas of scientific research they support, but certain types of research and research infrastructure span many of their missions.  
Clinical research, which refers to research involving human subjects, is conducted by NIH in-house investigators employed by the ICs (the Intramural Research Program) and through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts funded by the ICs.  NIH policies require the inclusion of a data and safety monitoring plan in each protocol for clinical research.  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html.  The method and degree of monitoring needed is related to the degree of risk to the human subjects and the complexity of the trial.  The NIH guidelines generally require monitoring in the form of DSMBs for Phase III clinical trials.  For earlier trials (Phases I and II), DSMBs are generally considered appropriate if the study has multiple clinical sites, is blinded (masked) or involves particularly high risk interventions or vulnerable populations. 
The number of DSMBs in operation at any given time varies; in a recent count, 340 were operating at NIH with about 2000 members total.  A DSMB?s length of service will depend on the clinical trial it is organized to monitor.  The number of times a DSMB meets in a given year will vary depending on the complexity of the trial and the data being accrued.  The length of individual DSMB meetings can range from several hours to a full day or more, and conference calls may occur between meetings with varying frequency. 
The tasks involved in the convening, management, and support of the NIH DSMBs are multifaceted and would need to be accomplished in close coordination with program staff from the IC and the principal investigator of the trial.  The tasks include:  (1) the identification, recruitment, and appointment of experts in a range of academic disciplines, including science, clinical care, statistics, and ethics based on NIH standards and guidance, and are expected to include conflict of interest reviews based on NIH standards to ensure that their advice is not biased by financial or professional conflicts of interest; (2) ensuring that the DSMB members are protected from legal liability through appropriate insurance; (3) the convening of meetings of the DSMB and all logistical support for those meetings, including arranging a conference room and processing travel and lodging; (4) ensuring that DSMB members have ready access to the trial design, data, and other factors pertinent to its safety, while safeguarding confidential information; and (5) designing and implementing mechanisms for obtaining clear analysis from the DSMB on the safety of the trial and for conveying that analysis promptly to the NIH.  Adequate insurance coverage for DSMB members is of particular importance, and responses to this RFI should address this issue specifically, providing evidence of the coverage that is available and its potential cost.    
If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information in response to this RFI:  (1) Organization name, address, e-mail address, website address and telephone number as well as business size and type of ownership for the organization; and (2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability and liability insurance availability for DSMB members. 
Organizations responding to this RFI should keep in mind that this is a market survey and that only focused and pertinent information is requested.  If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.  Taking into account the magnitude of this professional recruitment effort, organizations should also address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to coordinate and deliver contract performance.  No geographic restriction is anticipated, but if responding organizations are located outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, they should indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office(s) located in Bethesda, Maryland, to provide support to multiple sites and DSMBs.  
Responding firms should provide three (3) copies of a tailored capability statement to the above address no later than January 5, 2007.  You are also encouraged to transmit an electronic version of your capability statement, if available, to the Contracting Officer at vp5v@nih.gov.  This notice is being published in FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.
The Government will evaluate the submissions and other available market information to ascertain market capacity to (1) potentially provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; (2) potential capacity to secure and apply the full range of financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform those and similar requirements; (3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes compliance with tight program schedules, cost containment, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of DSMB members, obtaining adequate insurance coverage to protect the members from personal liability, carrying out and managing all DSMB functions and risk mitigation; (4)  potential to provide all necessary services under a performance based service acquisition contract.
This market survey may or may not result in a solicitation.  NIH may decide to continue its current practice.

<DESC>This is a full and open request for information and market survey to locate qualified companies and to develop an acquisition and technology planning approach for the next tactical satellite experiments.  The DoD Operationally Responsive Space S&T partners (AFRL, NRL, SMDC, and DDR&E ? Force Transformation) acting thru the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) are requesting technology and payload ideas and follow-up discussions to determine the best payload options for the next tactical satellite experiments, TacSat-5 and -6, as part of the DoD Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) initiative.  The TacSat-5 mission selection is expected in summer of 2007 and is expected to be the first TacSat experiment under the new ORS Joint Program Office currently in the process of being established. 
AFRL and SMDC will be hosting an Industry Day on 14 and 15 December, 2006 in Huntsville, AL.  Time will be provided for one-on-one discussions between government representatives and industry. Please indicate your desire for such a meeting. The purpose of this Industry Day is to describe this RFI and the associated capability gaps identified in the limited distribution capabilities document described below and present possible contracting options.  Attendance at this event will be limited to a maximum of two people per organization.  Please contact the AFRL technical focal point for additional information regarding this event.  This RFI is part of the ongoing collaboration between service and agency S&T organizations in developing and demonstrating payloads applicable to Operationally Responsive Space.  Previous industry days have been held by AFRL at Kirtland AFB and by NRL in Washington DC.  Holding this industry in Huntsville, AL reflects the importance of the Army SMDC Technical Center, Army SMDC Space Battle Lab, and Army Space Program Office contributions to the TacSat experiments and of the joint nature of Operationally Responsive Space.  The location of this Industry Day is not connected with the organization, staffing, operation and location of the Congressionally Directed ORS Office.  The details of that Office are still in development.


The TacSat experiments have dual purposes: to support a current warfighter need and to advance the development of an ORS capability by advancing the state of technology, CONOPS, TTPs, and overall ORS system understanding.  At this time, AFRL is interested in proposals both for operational prototypes and developmental payloads.  After responses to this RFI have been evaluated, senior leadership direction will determine the thrust for TacSat-5.  Therefore, two important references are 1) needs papers submitted by the COCOMs and Services each year to begin the TacSat selection process and 2) the DoD S&T Vector #2 ? for ORS.  The needs papers describe the most current needs the warfighter would like a TacSat experiment to address.  The S&T Vector #2 contains ORS goals requiring near-mid-and long term S&T investments to enable and increase ORS capabilities.  This vector is led by AFRL for the DoD S&T community.  Key points of these references have been summarized in this RFI.

Highlights of Current Needs Papers from the COCOMs and Services:
The needs papers submitted for TacSat-5 consideration fall into the following categories:

1.	Communication: DoD utilizes space based communications relay systems and data retrieval systems. DoD must have the ability to augment these systems in times of crisis as well as mitigate unplanned losses of these assets. 
2.	Position, Navigation and Timing (PN&T): US industry and commerce, and DoD utilizes on the Global Positioning System for global availability of position, navigation, and timing reference signals. DoD must have the ability to augment these systems in times of crisis as well as to mitigate unplanned losses of these assets. 
3.	Battlespace Characterization: US industry and DoD utilizes space-based systems for increasing awareness of the environment by gathering imaging and non-imaging data in the ultraviolet, visible, and infra-red spectrum; collecting space and terrestrial weather data, and gathering terrestrial electromagnetic environment data, including characterization of portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  DoD must have the ability to augment these systems in times of crisis as well as to mitigate unplanned losses of these assets.
4.	Space Situational Awareness and Defensive Countermeasures: US industry, civilian and DoD utilizes space-based systems for communications; PN&T; and environment and battlespace characterization. DoD must have the timely ability to understand potential natural and man-made threats to these assets and to appropriately react.

A classified, limited distribution (LIMDIS) document has been created that amplifies and details the various capability shortfalls identified above.  To get access to the LIMDIS document mentioned above, qualified participants should contact the below listed technical points of contact.  


DoD S&T Vector #2 Highlights:
The DoD S&T Vector #2 for ORS has the overall objective to develop the necessary technologies and capabilities to enable rapid development, acquisition and employment of low-cost space assets in order to responsively support joint tactical warfighters.  The four investment focus areas of this vector are:
?	Tactical operations and data dissemination
?	Advance small/micro satellite technologies
?	Modular design for flexible and rapid integration and testing
?	Rapid deployment on orbit

The payloads developed under this initiative attempt to meet or move the DoD closer to meeting the following long term ORS goals:
?	Support the needs of the tactical warfighter
?	Recurring total spacecraft cost < $20M, mass < 400kg
?	Less than 1 year development time
?	Enable rapid integration of new technologies and payloads (i.e. Plug-n-Play capable)
?	Support 1-3 years of on-orbit operations
?	Support rapid/responsive bus and launch vehicle integration timeline
?	Support on-orbit check-out in less than 1 orbital revolution
?	Support satellite command operations by team of less than 4 people for the bus and payload, including operational control of the payload by the appropriate organization attached to the Joint Force Commander
Furthermore, proposed payloads should advance the state-of-the-art of avionics standards with an emphasis on the plug and play being defined in the AIAA Space Plug and Play Avionics (SPA) standards.  Modularity of structural and thermal design is also a desirable attribute.

Payloads submitted should be compatible with existing and planned theater command, control, and communications (C3) architectures and support the ORS requirement to provide tactical tasking from and direct downlink to the theater forces. 

To develop the necessary technology to achieve this vision and these goals, the DoD is attempting to regularly develop tactical satellites, called TacSats and to fly them on missions to explore their military utility.  To determine the payload and mission for the upcoming TacSat-5 and -6 missions, the government is requesting Industry ideas for payload technologies and payload hardware.
 
RFI Submission?s Content, Guidelines, and Points of Contact:
With this Request for Information, the ORS program is requesting information and follow-up discussions to support research and development of rapid response payloads suitable for integration on a Government provided spacecraft bus and interface to Government furnished data storage and processing systems in response to the capability gaps identified in the TacSat-5 selection process. Responses should be no more than 10 pages, single-spaced, standard font size 12 point, and must adhere to the following format:

?	Paragraph #1: Description of proposed payload technology or hardware
?	Paragraph #2:  Brief summary of the candidate payload technology and payload?s mission objective.
?	Paragraph #3: Please quantify the specific benefit of this proposal to the warfighter.
?	Paragraph #4: Conceptual plans for payload development and payload to bus integration and launch in 12-18 months from program start.
?	Paragraph #5: Does this proposal satisfy a COCOM/warfighter requirement and to what extent? How will the payload proposal seamlessly fit into existing and planned battlefield architectures?
?	Paragraph #6: How does this proposal support the goals, to include increased responsiveness, outlined by the ORS program?
?	Paragraph #7: Description of payload to bus interface and required bus performance necessary to support the payload.
?	Paragraph #8: What are the technology readiness level(s) of the components and/or overall system of this proposal?
?	Paragraph #9: To what extent can the proposed payload adhere to the AIAA Space Plug and Play Avionics (SPA) standards?
?	Paragraph #10: Description of proposed costs 
?	Paragraph #11:  Identify all efforts related to this proposal which is/are currently government funded
?	Paragraph #12: Additional information required to completely describe the payload.
?	Paragraph #13: What is the expected traceability of the payload its TacSat experiment mission to an operational system?
?	Paragraph #14: What is the expected cost of a TacSat mission and the operational payload unit cost?
?	Paragraph #15:  Additional Information as deemed appropriate by participants (e.g., Concept of Operations points of interest, company history, etc.). 

The proposed technologies will be considered based on their ability to satisfy a COCOM/Service mission need, technical feasibility and affordability in addition to their applicability to ORS.  Senior DoD officials representing each service will make the final selection for the TacSat-5 mission as soon as reasonably possible, with anticipation of release of a solicitation pending availability of funds and IAW senior leader direction.   

AFRL is considering funding development in this specific technology area under a broad agency announcement and is attempting to gauge industry interest and ability to create capabilities to fill tactical requirements and needs.  Contact the AFRL technical focal points for assistance, if needed, in transmitting classified responses.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Forensic Document Laboratory (FDL) intends to pursue a sole source follow-on contract with Management Systems Designers (MSD), 2677 Prosperity Avenue, Fairfax, VA 22301.   

The requirement is to continue O&M support services for the Imaged Documents and Exemplars Library (IDEAL) that include management, digital conversion of documents received and continued design and development of the enhanced web application for document search and retrieval.  To meet the unique requirements of this requirement, a Contractor must possess the historical knowledge of the current IDEAL system and possess the expertise in database design in order to realize the FDL?s vision of a web based system.

The IDEAL system was developed in 1999 by MSD.   It is an integral component of the FDL and is currently operational.  Since IDEAL?s inception, over one hundred sixty five thousand (165K) documents have been stored, over sixty (60) document types have been bar coded, scanned and indexed and almost nine thousand (9000) text based Intelligence Reports have been entered into IDEAL.  The system is critical to ICE?s Law Enforcement mission for a number of reasons.  IDEAL catalogues and keeps track of all documents in the possession of the FDL?s library and the system provides an efficient tool (access via their desktop computer) for the Forensic Examiners and Operations Officers to determine if the FDL?s library has a genuine document exemplar on file in order to compare to a submitted case document, or assist the field with the authenticity of a suspect document.  This requirement is a critical law enforcement initiative to provide state-of-the art tools to identify fraudulent travel and identity documents that are used in attempts to gain illegal entry into the United States.

<SUBJECT>R -- Mod to Increase Ceiling
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to modify its contract # DOC50PAPT0501035 for Expert Advice & Assistance with F.M. Michalkewicz to increase the contract ceiling by $500,000.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling to accommodate an unexpected increase in current requirements within the general scope of the contract.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation at this time would incur substantial duplication of costs during a lengthy transition period that would not be recovered through competition.  The Government has also determined that a lengthy transition at this time would cause delivery delays and jeopardize program execution.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the 3M-AIT Passport Reader.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the 3M-AIT Passport Readers to support Consular posts overseas.  3M-AIT Passport Readers have been deployed in all Consular Systems Modernization installations since the inception of the program. Additional units are primarily required at this time to replace any existing AIT PAX readers in need of maintenance, thus extending the life of the VISA Quality Assurance procedure.  The reader was initially selected because the travel document production systems with which it is used required an accurate, reliable instrument to perform quality assurance checks on the OCR zones of visas and passports, thereby validating their machine readability. The reader enables Consulates to generate travel documents that will be accepted and accurately interpreted at any port of entry employing mechanized processing systems. This is of great importance since it eliminates or minimizes incidences of false interpretations of bearer identification data.  Such mis-reads can result in the refusal of entry or passage to qualified bearers, impede the processing flows at ports of entry, and otherwise embarrass the U.S. Government. <BR><BR>The AIT reader was selected following a very lengthy market survey and evaluation process.  It was found to be the only device of its type able to meet the Bureaus specifications.  Features of the unit evaluated are as follows: -Reads International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and non-ICAO compliant documents -Performs quality assurance analysis -Multi-function magnetic stripe reader and OCR -Two RS-232 serial ports and one universal serial bus (USB) port -Remotely upgradeable software -Rugged, no-moving parts design Due to these factors, the QA modules of travel document production systems were designed around the AIT readers. The selection of any other type or make of reader may put the functionality of overseas visa, passport, and border crossing card systems at risk. Such measures will necessitate the re-engineering of all U.S. travel document issuance systems and will significantly increase the Governments costs.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested 3M-AIT Passport Readers without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST has selected the 3M-AIT Passport Readers because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The 3M-AIT Passport Reader has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the readers soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturers equipment similar to the 3M-AIT Passport Readers in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year. <BR><BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (GC851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>AFDW/A7KS, Bolling AFB, DC, is soliciting offers for a language learning system as specified below.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information as included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The reference number is F1AF296335A100 and will be issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The NAICS code is 511210  and the size standard is $23M.  This acquisition is being solicited as a Total Set-Aside for Small Business.  There are two line items as follows:  

CLIN 0001 ? Special Purpose Learning/Language Software		     	1 EACH

The general requirement is for software, integration, training and support for a language learning system for multiple languages.  These language software programs will allow users to work independently at various levels of difficulty. The programs can be distributed quickly and run on multiple platforms such as desktops, laptops, handheld devices or downloaded from websites. SAF/IAPA requires a comprehensive system that can support a wide range of languages and military domains.  It is essential that new and lesser known languages can be developed quickly. Key differentiators are interactive language learning software programs, military content, conversational content, diplomatic/political content, quick deployment, independent learning, and less commonly taught languages.

Deliverables provide the following general functionalities: 
1. Software that allows users to learn vocabulary and phrases in a large number of designated target languages:  Computer software that enables the learner to rapidly memorize utterances, likely replies, general and job related vocabulary lists. The user will be able to memorize words and phrases relevant to the domain. Hardware/Software enable the learner to communicate by selecting prerecorded general and job related utterances on a computer screen and having the computer speak the utterances. The user will be able to independently improve language knowledge and pronunciation in the target domain. The user will be able to communicate by having a computer pronounce and display words or phrases selected from a pre-established set.

2. Immersion Language Training Software in designated target languages:  Language immersion software simulates environments enabling language learners to independently build vocabulary, investigate language structure, perfect pronunciation, and role play conversations and gain other key language skills in specialized topic areas. Immersion language training software allows users to learn and enhance their language skills in a given target language within a specified subject domain. Filmed scenarios will allow the user to interact with fictitious characters in target language in selected domains.  For SAF/IAPA purposes, these may be scenarios involving such activities as conversations with government officials, politicians and military members and understanding local press reports (newspapers, television, radio).  Language learners should be able to investigate the meaning and forms of the dialog used in the scenarios. Vocabulary building, word order, and pronunciation exercises are an integral part of the immersion training software.

3. Required Functionalities:
1.	Video Content Management For All Designated Target Languages.  Individual video segments correspond to the current text.  Video will include recorded soundtrack. (Studio sound quality) 
2.	Audio Support For All Designated Target Language Content: Native speakers pronounce individual words and phrases. (Studio sound quality)

The system will be solely software based without any hardware dependencies other than microphones and speakers.  The system can work on any platform run on the Windows Operating System
16.	Software allows the user to select a word or phrase from a set of words or phrases relevant to the domain, and have the computer then pronounce the selected word or phrase.  The system will be solely software-based without any hardware dependencies, except microphone and speaker. The system can work on any platform run on the Windows operating system.
17.	Government will designate PDA systems. If the designated PDA software is government owned, the government will provide file format information or make it available to the contractor.
18.	Integrate the pronunciation and memorization software components for use by handheld devices. The contractor will develop engines to download these components onto commercial handheld devices designated by SAF/IAPA.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is being amended in response to a question that was submitted.

Question:   Since, the class quota is set at 25 students with only two forklifts at the locations for hands on training, would the United States Coast Guard rather have two instructors to conduct the training?  One to perform the application training while the other is conducting the technical training.

Answer:  The Coast Guard wishes to maintain one instructor.  This class primarily focuses on being a train the trainer course; therefore the instructor is focusing on teaching the students to be instructors instead of forklift operators. This class is not an introduction to forklifts.
