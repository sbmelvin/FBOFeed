<SUBJECT>RF- Detontaion Chamber
<SOLNBR>13-RFI-061513
<RESPDATE>071513
<CONTACT>Lynda M. Theisen, Fax 703-632-8480, Email Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Laboratory Division (LD) is seeking information on the acquisition, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of an explosive blast containment detonation chamber for research purposes, hereafter referred to as a "detonation chamber", at an FBI Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory under construction on a U.S. military reservation.<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the FBI is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Interested parties are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the expense of the interested party. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor that site for additional information, if any, pertaining to this requirement.<br /><strong><br />1.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong><br />The FBI is interested in establishing, under the auspices of the LD, an in-house capability to safely synthesize, scale up, characterize, and test improvised explosives in a variety of experimental scenarios, to test and evaluate explosives detection capabilities, and to test and evaluate the uses and effectiveness of different render safe procedure tools and techniques. Improvised explosives consist of suitable combinations of fuels and oxidizers (either as physical mixtures or incorporated at the molecular level) that can have energetic potential. <br /><br />Since 2004, the FBI LD has been technically directing an explosives characterization research initiative to better understand the threat from these materials. Tests previously performed have included measurements of the safety, hazards, thermal stability, physical stability, and explosives performance characteristics of these energetic materials. Safety and hazard characterization of improvised explosives provides crucial information regarding their safe handling and manufacturing. Performance characterization experiments test the explosive in a variety of scenarios to determine its explosive potential and quantify its energy release. <br /><br />The FBI LD is constructing an Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory to support improvised explosives characterization and research. Improvised explosive research at the new facility and a dedicated explosives test range will include small scale safety testing, thermal stability examination, and explosive performance testing. The Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory facility will contain separate rooms for mixing small amounts of explosives materials (up to 200 grams), determining chemical and physical characteristics, storage of pre-cursor chemicals, remote control, and mixing batches of explosives up to 10 lb Net Explosive Weight (TNT equivalent). Completion of construction of the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory and an explosives test range is anticipated for February 2014. <br /><br />An Explosive Safety Siting Plan has been approved by the DOD Explosive Safety Board for the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory. That plan requires separate DOD Explosives Safety Board approval for any detonation chamber installed within the facility. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. General requirements<br /></span></strong><br />Following are high level requirements/features desired for the research-focused (not demilitarization "demil" operations) detonation chamber (sometimes referred to as a "bombproof" or "indefinite lifecycle" detonation chamber). Note that when the detonation chamber is not being utilized for testing it will be utilized as a remote, explosive mixing facility:<br /><br />&bull; Walk-in chamber capable of comfortably accommodating 2 persons;<br />&bull; Steel and/or steel and reinforced concrete construction; inner lining of walls, floor, and ceiling must be replaceable in sections to accommodate testing of fragment-producing shots detailed below; <br />&bull; Steel floor that contains a recess or trough around the inside perimeter to facilitate collection of water from cleaning or deluge operations;<br />&bull; Rated not-to-exceed 2 lb TNT Equivalent Net Explosive Weight (NEW) fragment-producing shots; typical fragmentation would be schedule 40 steel pipe (no shape charge devices will be tested in the chamber);<br />&bull; Chamber must be able to hold the quasi-static pressure developed after the shot until released; pressure release/venting should occur via a remotely-operated valve operated from the Control Room; an easily accessible manual over-ride valve must also exist in case of remote operation failure; intake vent should be located near bottom of chamber; exit vent should be located near top of chamber, on opposite side of intake vent; <br />&bull; An internal bag catch/scrubber system should be used to collect detonation product venting; there can be no venting of the detonation products to the external atmosphere;<br />&bull; Equipped with deluge system, with manual over-ride capability;<br />&bull; Equipped with approximately twelve, 12" diameter easily accessible ports, of which eight are equally spaced at two heights around the perimeter of the chamber and four on the chamber top; ports should be user-configurable, threaded, and possess excellent optical properties to permit use of external lighting, camera systems, flash x-ray systems, data lines, or power lines; ports must accommodate the attachment of pressure transducers for measuring blast pressure;<br />&bull; Multiple contact points on the outside and rear for grounding;<br />&bull; Two integral ladders on the outside of the chamber to facilitate access to the chamber top;<br />&bull; One doorway which can be secured and sealed to prevent blast pressure from escaping through the door opening; the doorway should be able to be operated (opened/closed) remotely from the Control Room; the doorway should contain a "dead man" switch that cuts all electrical power to the chamber when the door is in an open position; doorway width should be sufficient to accommodate the entry of mixing equipment on casters and other equipment on pallet jacks;<br />&bull; Chamber must comply with applicable DOD Explosive Safety Board requirements and standards, including: <br />o DOD 6055.09-M, "Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards", 29 February 2008, Administratively reissued 4 August 2010; <br />o AR 385-64, U.S. Army Explosives Safety Program, 24 May 2011;<br />o DA Pamphlet 385-65, "Explosives and Chemical Site Plan Development and Submission", 1 February 2008;<br />o AR 385-10, "The Army Safety Program", 14 June 2010;<br />o "Explosives Safety Siting Software", Naval Facilities engineering Service Center, Version 6.0; and <br />o UFC 3-340-02, "Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions", 5 December 2008. <br />Because remote operator protection distance and K328 separation cannot be provided within the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory, the detonation chamber must be designed such that the resulting QD separations will be zero. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations</span>: All parts of the chamber must be able to fit through a 12' (W) x 14' (H) recoiling door opening with ground-level access (no dock). The FBI anticipates the acquisition of two (2) identical detonation chambers that will reside next to each other with approximately 2 - 3 feet of clearance between the two chambers. When one chamber is not in use for detonation testing, it will be utilized as a remote mixing facility. The assembled chambers must fit within a space of 10' (W) x 30' (L) x 10' (H) and must not exceed a floor slab capacity of 30,000 lb on four feet at the corners of the 10' x 30' footprint. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Security Requirements</span>: Any individuals requiring access to construction drawings of the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory and related facilities will be required to undergo, at a minimum, an FBI enhanced Limited Background Investigation and sign sensitive information non-disclosure agreements; any individuals requiring access to the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory for delivery and installation of equipment and systems will be required to undergo, at a minimum, an FBI enhanced Limited Background Investigation. All individuals requiring access to the Explosives Synthesis and Testing Laboratory for the performance of scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repairs (both warranty and post-warranty periods) will be required to undergo, at a minimum, an FBI enhanced Limited Background Investigation. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />3.0 Requested Information: In your response, please address the following items</span>: <br /></strong><br />3.1 Briefly describe your firm's capability/experience/current or past contracts in designing, fabricating, and installing the aforementioned or similar detonation chamber. <br /><br />3.2 Briefly describe your firm's capability/experience/current or past contracts in providing post-warranty scheduled operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) services and unscheduled repair services for the aforementioned chamber.
