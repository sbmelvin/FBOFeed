Hydrologist to work on the Island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands to analysis water wells. There are 14 well fields on Saipan with a total of 130 wells that pump 24 hours per day 365 days per year.  Total production from the well fields is about 10-11 million gallons per day (Mgal/d).  During 2002 the volume-weighted chloride-ion concentration for the total amount of water pumped from wells was about 1,100 milligrams per liter.  Three of the 14 well fields currently are pumping water of an acceptable quality and will not require most of the work proposed for the other well fields; however the aquifer providing water to these well fields will be evaluated for a possible expansion of production from new wells.  WORK ELEMENTS REQUIRED:  * Compile and examine all information on each well in the field from published USGS reports, data summaries, and CUC records which will be made available.  Information includes date and details of well construction pump HP, intake depth, amount of drawdown, water table elevation and annual fluctuations, depth and salinity profiles from wells, down-hole video records of most well bores and the amounts and quality of water produced over the operational history of the well.  *  Field inspection of each well in the well field to determine existing condition of the wellhead plumbing, valves and meters, electrical panel, pumping rate, and sample the well discharge for temperature, specific conductance and chloride concentration.  Chloride samples to be analyzed by the CUC laboratory.  * From all the above information determine the corrective action required, if any, for each well and the equipment and materials needed for the work within the well bore.  Meet as necessary with the CUC Drilling Crew to provide necessary instruction for the work required.  * Provide specifications and list materials required for standardizing well head plumbing, valves, and metering suitable for all wells.  Consult with a CUC electrical engineer to determine and specifications for a standardized motor control panel within a weather and insect proof electrical box, and for the proper conduit and junction box for the submersible cable run from the well head to the motor panel.  * From historical data provided by salinity profiles and/or conductance and chloride ion concentrations obtained from each well recommended a dry and wet season pumping rate.  * From the results of this work provide recommendations for the permanent or temporary shutdown of some wells based on water quality data and/or well conditions.  * Oversee aquifer tests (48-hours) on some wells where data on drawdown, pumping rate and water quality are insufficient or not available.  * Work with the USGS Saipan Office Chief to identify well fields where data indicate that exploratory drilling and testing may provide additional production wells which will pump water of acceptable quality.  Propose sites for this drilling.  * Assist the CUC Drill Crew and the USGS Saipan office Chief in obtaining bids/quotations from Drilling Supply Companies and equipment manufacturers for needed equipment and materials.  * The hydrologist will be avalable for meetings and discussions with the Water Task Force and CUC while on island.  When off island the hydrologist will be available at reasonable times for brief telephone, fax, and email discussions of the work with USGS, CUC and Water Task Force personnel.  * Provide to the District Chief and the Saipan Office Chief a written summary report of work accomplished, problems encountered and recommendations.  An invoice should be provided to the District Chief after each on island visit.  Maintain a daily log of activities while on island to and provide this to the Saipan office Chief.   EXPIERNCE REQUIRED:  Working knowledge of, and experience in the  conduction of ground water studies.  Working knowledge of freshwater-saltwater aquifers containing a thin freshwater lens and the development of this type of aquifer system by wells and shafts.  Working knowledge of and experience with the utilization of the various types of hydrologic and water quality data collected for the quantification, development and management of thin fresh water lens aquifer systems.  Working knowledge of, and experience in, conducting aquifer tests.  Working knowledge of water well construction and materials used, well remediation practices, wellhead plumbing and submersible pump and motors.  Basic knowledge of well drilling equipment.  Experience in the preparation of technical reports.  The work should be accomplished by up to eight (8) on island visits or work periods, if the hydrologist is a resident of Saipan, of between 20-30 days each over a period of 18-24 months.  The first visit or work period should be scheduled for the hydrologist to be on Saipan before the end of January 2004.  The time and frequency of future visits or work period will be agreed upon in consultation with the USGS District Chief in Honolulu.  Office space in Saipan with telephone and fax service will be provided by the USGS and/or the Water Task Force.  If the hydrologist is not a resident of Saipan, travel to and from Saipan, living accommodations, vehicle rental, and subsistence will be the responsibility of the hydrologist.  Please contact Ann Margrave (209)742-5079  or email - amargrave@usgs.gov with any questions.

<DESC>The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>DESC: CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW FIELD OFFICE FOR THE HOUSTON DIVISION OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI), Request for Proposal (RFP) No. GS-07P-04-URC-1003.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project.  Contractors shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head.  This letter shall include a statement of interest, DUNS number, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference (maximum of 2) and a copy of a valid business license.  Letters are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than January  23rd, 2004.  Send letters to the attention of Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Gulf Coast Service Center, (7PEG-FW), Room 12A5, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors (bidders list) to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $48,000,000 to $54,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about January 30th, 2004.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held February 11th, 2004 in Houston, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.  GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with construction contractors that offer the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The proposed project will be constructed on a ten acre site within the city limits of Houston, Texas.  This project is a new Field Office for the Houston Division of the FBI located near the intersection of Hwy 290 and West 43rd Street in northwest Houston, Texas.  The scope of this project includes but is not limited to the construction of an eight-story, cast-in-place concrete Office Building topped by a steel framed penthouse both totaling approximately 22,300 gross square meters.  The Office Building has a double exterior wall.  The inner, weather tight wall consists of the concrete structural wall with a metal panel covering.  Punched windows in this wall are aluminum frames with insulating glass.  The outer wall consists of laminated glass panels on a steel support structure cantilevered 40 inches from the concrete structure.  This outer wall is not weather or air tight and acts as a sunshade for the building.  To the north of the Office Building, the project also includes a single-story Annex Building of approximately 4,700 gross square meters.  The southern half of this building houses office functions and is cast-in-place concrete.  The northern half is a steel frame structure housing vehicle repair bays.  The entire exterior is clad with metal panel to match the office building.  The first floor areas of the Office and Annex are served by an overhead HVAC air distribution system.  Floors 2 through 8 of the Office take advantage of the access floor system and HVAC is provided by an under-floor air distribution system.  Along the north side of this site is a three-level pre-cast concrete Parking Garage of approximately 21,000 gross square meters housing approximately 673 cars.  A Guard Building will be included at one of 2 site entries.  Both entries are equipped with vehicle deterrent systems.  The site includes an approximately 3 ft. high concrete wall and is backed up by earth berms.  A 6 ft. high metal fence rests on top of this concrete wall.  Surface parking is provided on the site for approximately 72 vehicles.  The project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Rating System.  Occupancy of the field office is planned for the late Fall of 2006.  This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 233320.  The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The entire procurement process will be performed in two (2) stages.  The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both stages.  Stage I Submission Requirements: Request for Proposal (RFP) for technical documents from those firms responding to this CBD announcement.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Stage II) at no recompense to the offeror(s).  The technical factors will be as follows: (#1) Past Performance on Similar Projects; (#2) Experience on Similar Projects; (#3) Detailed Management Plan and Technical Approach; and (#4) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel of the Prime.  Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of offerors that offer the best values will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306(c) to further compete in Stage II.  Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s).  Stage I submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business March 1st, 2004.  Stage II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation.  

This project will require certain security measures be adhered to.  Protocols involving security background investigations have been implemented to establish that Government contractors, licensees, certificate holders, and grantees are cleared for access to special information to material.  Therefore, without exception, either restricted/limited security investigations and/or an extensive background investigation is being conducted on all individuals working on this project.  The information provided by each individual for their background investigation is voluntary and the processing may affect security clearance prospects if not completed in a timely matter, or if each item of information requested is not provided.  In addition to questions on the security application form, successful Stage I offerors may be asked to bring documents about information provided on the security clearance form or other matters requiring further explanation.  Additionally, successful stage I offerors may also be required to participate in a personal interview as a routine course of the investigative process.  This interview will provide an opportunity to update, clarify, and explain information on the security application form more completely, if necessary.  The interview generally conducted following review of submitted information, often helps to expedite and complete the investigation.  

The level of effort in the Stage II phase includes the following: (#1) Subcontractor Qualifications; (#2) mandatory, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7 encompassing the following Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Business (40%), Small Disadvantaged Business (8%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Service-disabled Veteran-owned business (2%) and Veteran-owned (3%); and (#3) price proposal.  Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable.  Stage II submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business August 23rd,  2004.  GSA shall schedule two site visit opportunities during this stage.  All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business August 9th, 2004.  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-07P-04-URC-1003.  Following the Pre-Proposal Conference that is scheduled during Stage I, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking Session for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Minority, Woman-Owned, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned businesses.  The session is tentatively scheduled on February 11th, 2004.

Attendance at these sessions is not mandatory.  The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering bidding on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  A Bidders list will be made available to all participants at the networking sessions.  Pre-registration by February 4th, 2004 is requested.  Questions about the Networking Session and Registration information should be directed to LaVida Barnes , GSA Office of Enterprise Development (817) 978-0800 or fax to (817) 978-0440; Internet lavida.barnes@gsa.gov.

Agency Name  Department of the Navy		 Naval Sea Systems Command	  Code 02612B		  1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE	 Stop 2050	 Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-2050		 2.  Research Opportunity Title -  Torpedo Detection, Classification & Localization (DCL)  3.  Program Name – Surface Ship Torpedo Defense  4.  BAA  Number -  N00024-04-R-6105 5.  Response Date  -  This announcement will remain open until white papers are due (12 February 2004 by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time). White Papers Due:	White Papers must be submitted by 12 February 2004 by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time). Full Proposals Due:	Upon notification from NAVSEA, Full Proposals from those offerors whose White Papers were identified as being of “parti cular value” (evaluation criteria listed below) must be submitted by 14 April 2004 by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time). 6.  Research Opportunity Description –  NAVSEA is interested in receiving “White Papers” and “Full Proposals” for Research & Development (R&D) pertaining to Torpedo Detection Classification & Localization (DCL).  The objective of this BAA is to seek technical concepts, and proposals for executing a twenty-seven month R&D effort culminating with conducting a series of at-sea DCL demonstrations, according to the following six points, approximately 15 and 20 months after contract award: •	Demonstrate a prototype acoustic DCL Subsystem (consisting of active and passive towed sensors with a DCL processor) capable of detection, localization, and tracking of torpedo targets and generating the bearing and range accuracy necessary to engage a torpedo (or salv o of two torpedoes) with low probability of false alarm; •	Torpedo targets will be representative of current threat scenarios; •	Prove ability to recognize and process simple salvo (two torpedoes) threats; •	Demonstrate the DCL from an appropriate surface ship platform; •	Demonstrate the DCL on an instrumented range for the purpose of component system validation; and •	Structure the DCL demonstration to gather empirical data to support, with confidence, the ability to move rapidly to a complex (more than two) salvo engagement capability. The contractor(s) for this BAA will provide DCL information, for single torpedo and simple salvo scenarios, sufficient for commanding the launch of an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT), currently being developed by the Applied Research Laboratory / Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU).  The winning BAA contractor(s) will be expected to defi ne their interface requirements to ARL to allow for successful interface and integration. The purpose of the DCL demonstration is to directly evaluate the capability of the DCL system’s potential for meeting Key Capability Parameters (KCPs).  KCPs are indicators of the demonstrated system’s ability to meet overall Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) such as Probability of Detection, Probability of Correct Classification, Probability of False Alarm, etc., after continued full System Design & Development upon completion of the demonstration.  KCPs include the following system characteristics: •	Automated (No Man in the Loop) •	Assured Detection / Minimal False Alarm •	Localization Compatible With ATT •	Synergistic with Softkill countermeasures •	No Increase in Manning from AN/SLQ-25A •	Compatible with the AN/SLQ-25A winch •	Utilizes TRM land-based simulation 7.

<CONTACT>John Sherman Contracting Officer 3032360225     John_Sherman@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order using commercial acquisition procedures to Tobin International, Inc. P.O. Box 708903 San Antonio, TX 78270-8902.  The proposed procurement under NBR040012, is for a perpetual site license for oil and gas data and one year of software maintenance.  Rationale for the sole source procurement include: 1.The BLM has a nationwide contract with IHS Energy Group (IHS) to provide each BLM office with historical oil and gas well data on CD's. The CD's are received on a monthly basis. This data set includes fields for the longitude and latitude of the surface and bottom hole of each well. These fields are essential for subsequent GIS mapping of the well sites. For most areas in the country, these fields are populated with location data. However, for some areas, including the gulf coastal states, IHS does not provide sufficient data in these fields. However, Tobin does possess this information in their data collection. Because of this, IHS has an exclusive agreement with Tobin, whereby the location Tobin data, which is already is embedded on the IHS CD, is activated through a user profile for those users that pay a license fee to Tobin for access to their data.  The Tobin data is available to any licensed user of the IHS product lines. Tobin warrants that its data will work correctly with the IHS products. Hence, as no other vendor has an agreement with IHS to provide the location data on the IHS CD's and it is essential that the data be included on the IHS CD's that we are now receiving per the nationwide contract, there is no other source for the product we are requesting. 2. Tobin SuperBase well and land grid data sets are calculated by Tobin International Inc.  from aerial photography and extensive historical archive research.  Data provided from any another vendor would have to be based on the same collection standards and must include the same geographic areas. 3. The SuperBase land grid data is precisely matched to the SuperBase well data. It is imperative that the two data sets have the same level of accuracy. These data sets are used in tandem for geographic analysis. Mixing the well data with grids from another vendor could result in unacceptable errors in calculations of relative distance, direction and/or area.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If no written response is received by February 13, 2004, to the effect that comparable items/services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these items/services through a sole-source procurement with Tobin International Inc., a sole-source award will be made.

INTRODUCTION:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) and to subsequently award a Design Services Subcontract for Nevada Rail and Transportation. It is BSC's intent to award a single subcontract for the services. However, BSC reserves the right to award multiple subcontracts if it is determined to be in the best interest of BSC, and the government, to cover the scope of services required. The RFP will be made available only to pre-qualified firms or teams. 

To potentially achieve pre-qualification and receive a RFP, respondents must submit: 1) a completed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) or equivalent, and 2) a completed FAR Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) or equivalent. Item 1) should be submitted for the lead firm (or for each lead firm if a joint venture) and for each consulting firm or independent associate on the team. Item 2) should be a single submittal on behalf of the entire team. Failure to complete a form may be reason for non-qualification of a team.   


SCOPE DEFINITION:

As part of the Yucca Mountain Repository development efforts, the Department of Energy has announced the Caliente rail corridor as its preferred corridor in which to construct a rail line in Nevada, and Carlin as a secondary preference.  If the Department adopts the mostly rail mode in Nevada, DOE will issue a Record of Decision selecting a rail corridor not sooner than 30 days after publication of the preference announcement in the Federal Register dated December 29, 2003.  The primary Caliente Corridor originates at a junction with the Union Pacific mainline near Caliente, Nevada and extends 319 miles to the Yucca Mountain site (see Figure 1), located approximately 90 miles north of Las Vegas.  The corridor is nominally 1/4 mile (400-meters) wide and consists of a "primary" corridor along with "secondary" options. After completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), DOE will identify, in a Record of Decision (ROD), a single rail alignment within the corridor.  

Phases:
Phase 1 - Conceptual Design (Approximately 12 months from a Notice To Proceed)
Potential Options:
Phase 2 (Potential Option)  - Preliminary Engineering/Contract Documents (Approximately 24 months from end of Conceptual Design)
Phase 3 (Potential Option) - Follow on Design Services (Approximately 40 months from start of design/build construction)  


Phase 1 - Subcontractor's Work Performance and Organization:

The SUBCONTRACTOR shall perform at least 80% of the self-performed work (i.e. not third tier subcontracted work) at the SUBCONTRACTOR's offices in Las Vegas, Nevada
The SUBCONTRACTOR shall provide office space, conference room space, furniture, equipment, and other facilities for the exclusive use of SUBCONTRACTOR's own project staff (including third tier subcontractor personnel) for the work scope herein defined and for the general use of the CONTRACTOR's Nevada Transportation project personnel. Such space shall ideally be situated within a 10 minute walking time of the existing BSC offices on Town Center Drive in Summerlin, Nevada, but in no event shall be more than 5 lineal miles from such location. 

The organization shall be lead by a permanent senior technical manager who shall be the principal point of contact between CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR and shall be responsible for all aspects of the SUBCONTRACTOR's work. The senior technical manager shall coordinate, direct and manage all work performed by the SUBCONTRACTOR in CONTRACTOR's office in Las Vegas, at SUBCONTRACTOR's home office and third tier subcontract work wherever performed.

If the Department adopts the mostly rail mode in Nevada, DOE will issue a Record of Decision selecting a rail corridor no sooner than 30 days after publication of the preference announcement in the Federal Register dated December 29, 2003.  The primary Caliente Corridor originates at a junction with the Union Pacific mainline near Caliente, Nevada and extends 319 miles to the Yucca Mountain site, which is 90 miles to the northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (see Figure 1).  The corridor is nominally 1/4 mile (400-meters) wide and consists of a "primary" corridor along with "secondary" options. After completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on alternate rail alignments within the corridor, DOE will identify, in a Record of Decision, a rail alignment within the corridor.

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain support from NESCAUM to perform specialized outreach for ESIB's Combined Heat  and Power (CHP) Partnership, which promotes the implementation  of CHP projects and industrial applications through education, coordination and technical assistance.  NESCAUM  is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement due to the fact that it is the only known non-profit organization that  provides targeted technical information  to environmental regulators in the Northeast, as well as other stakeholders concerning regulatory approaches which recognize pollution prevention benefits of CHP applications. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this  procurement is 541620. It has been determined that because of the ability of NESCAUM to develop, educate and implement output-based emissions approaches and other innovations to air emissions  regulation in the Northeast, as well as its knowledge of specific CHP technologies, it is the only vendor  uniquely qualified to meet this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement  will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PREVIOUS FEDBIZOPS NOTICE W15QKN-04-R-0500 IS CANCELLED AND REPLACED AS FOLLOWS. The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research,Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC),Picatinny Arsenal,  NJ 07806-5000 is contemplating an award of a 100% small business set-aside  requirement to manufacture full scale inert M241and M242 Training Aids that contain sectioned M241 and M242 charges in their corresponding sectioned  metal ammunition storage containers.  The 155mm M241/M242 propelling charges  known as Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) are two different propelling  charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete  zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic  increment.  During development and fielding of the MACS Charge, the U.S. Army  TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale displays  and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction,  packaging and field application.  The M241 charges are used at lower zones  (Zones 1 & 2), while the M242 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3 through 6.  The training aids include production of thirty (30) M242 and thirty (30) M242 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in their metal ammunition storage container.  Since the soldiers will be trained on the  cutaways, it is required that they are of the same quality and construction as the live version using inert materials.  Before submitting the drawing  requirement, the cutaway training aid can be seen at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ by  submitting a request to lchang@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-7402. The offeror is  required to include product marking and assembly drawings showing detailed  design and construction of the M241 and M242 sectioned Training Aids. The  offeror shall also provide a plan detailing receipt of raw materials and  manufacturing of the M241 and M242 Training Aids.  The offeror shall include  drawing(s) and plan in their proposal to the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC for  approval.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical  Technologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to  DoD Directives 5230.224 and 5230.25. Request all information be submitted via  electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil, Margaret Rhinesmith, (973)  724-3050.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firms submitting a proposal must register in the GSA ITSS system prior to closing date for receipt of proposals.   Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Fl is equipping its new Air Traffic Control Tower. This requirement was originally solicited under another solicitation number and cancelled.  Two proposals were received under the cancelled solicitation.  (Previous price quotations received under the cancelled RFP ranged from $260,000 to $279,000).  The tower requires a fully integrated Voice Communications System for Air Traffic Control. This system will provide control of air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communications to include access to radios and public and private telephone networks. This work should meet technical standards set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control tower radios and communication systems.  The system should have superior voice quality and non-blocking access to all audio channels. A touch screen control panel is preferred. Four workstations are required. Three workstations will be located in the tower cab in console locations designated by KSC. One workstation will be installed in the Landing Aids Control Building (LACB). LACB is located approximately 2 miles from the tower. Eight air to ground radio systems are required for the tower. Three radios will be GFE.  Successful offeror will procure additional radios as described below and install all eight systems at the tower location. The work to be performed includes installation of 3 workstations in the Air Traffic Control Tower cab, installation of 5 VHF radio systems in the Tower. Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed VHF radios, installation of 3 UHF radio systems in the Tower. Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed UHF radios, two Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) VHF radio transmitters and receivers will be a Motorola CM 200, one Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) UHF radio transmitter and receiver will be a Motorola CM 200. Workstations in tower cab must be capable of using LACB installed backup radios if a tower radio fails. The task also requires installation of 32 channel DVD digital voice recorder system in the Tower, Installation of 1 workstation in the LACB, training for KSC technicians on new voice system, appropriate documentation in format designated by NASA/KSC following completion of project, systems to be connected to the workstations include 3 Point to Point telephones, 6 FAA shout lines and 5 local radio nets, installation of  provided tunable antenna and run new heliax cable from the antenna to the rear area of the tunable A/G radio located in the tower, for connection of existing A/G radios at the LACB to the touch screen interface, and providing antennas and other necessary hardware for all eight radio systems.  Offeror shall deliver an operable voice communication control system for the NASA Shuttle Landing Facility Air Traffic Control Tower and LACB with installed systems set to KSC designated frequencies.    Facility shall be available from 7am to 3:30pm local time. All contactor employees must obtain KSC badge.  Delivery and installation should be within 90 days of order placement. 
2.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-2 titled “Evaluation-Commercial Items” shall apply.  Technical merit is more important than price.  However, when technical differences become less significant, price will become increasingly more important.   Total proposed price will be evaluated.  Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, may receive no further consideration.  The Government will evaluate technical proposals based on the factors of past experience and technical approach with past experience being slightly more important than technical approach.  Past experience will be evaluated according to the extent to which the offeror’s documented past experience is similar to the nature, complexity, and scope of work described in the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate each offeror’s technical approach for completeness, the extent to which it demonstrates that it will meet requirements in an effective manner, and qualifications of those assigned (if applicable) to carry out the technical approach being offered.    The offeror shall describe its approach for meeting the requirements of the SOW and how it plans to conduct the work.  To support the past experience evaluation, please list the dollar value of similar project, timeframe completed, brief description of your firm’s role in project, etc.  Technical proposals should be limited to no more than 10 pages.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4,Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition 11.

<SOLNBR>ESUP
<RESPDATE>110303
<ARCHDATE>06302005
<CONTACT>Shannon Prince,937-904-4245
<DESC>UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.  Jay Kilpatrick II, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317 or to: ASC/YTA, Mrs. Sally Meyer,  Contracting Officer, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433- 7211, Phone 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-10-03) RELEASE OF 29 SEPT 03 INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: 1) List of Attendees 2) 3 Presentations (ASC/YTA; AETC/XPRU; T38ANTHRO_DRZEHNER) 3) List of Questions and Answers  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  the ESUP Industry Day info noted above please email them to  Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil. ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-3-03) MEMORANDUM FOR REGISTRANT FOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM: ASC/YTA  1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201 I Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 SUBJECT: T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program, Request for Information (RFI)  1.  To assist the government in our market research, we invite your company to  submit an RFI response package.  It is recommended that packages submitted  follow the outline format noted in paragraph 2 below.  You are asked to address  engineering capabilities and modifications necessary to modify the crew station  of 509 T-38 aircraft to fully meet the requirements to (a) accommodate and (b)  safely eject the range of aircrew sizes as specified in Attachment 1.   Currently, there are no developmental funds available.  This RFI is to solicit  industry feedback to aid the government in developing an acquisition strategy  for this program.  It does not constitute a solicitation for proposals and no  contract will be awarded as a result.  Your response is strictly voluntary and  the government will not reimburse your company for costs you incur responding  to this RFI or in providing follow-up information. 2.  It is the desire of the government that any proposed approach meets and/or  exceeds the key performance parameters (KPPs) and other requirements listed  within Attachment 1.  The government is interested in understanding:     a. What is available in today’s marketplace to meet these requirements?     b. What, if any, development an offeror believes is necessary to meet these  requirements.         (1)Hardware development?        (2)Software development?     c. What vendor capabilities exist in the marketplace relative to         (1)Designing        (2)Manufacturing, and/or         (3)Integration of any proposed solution or subset thereof        (4)Specifications and/or other data showing how a proposed approach  meets and/or exceeds the government’s requirements.     d. The rough order of magnitude cost (ROM) associated with your proposed  approach, and;     e. Your recommendations as to the most reasonable/cost effective  acquisition strategy for this program.       f. RFI response packages should also include a description of previous  aircraft modifications you have accomplished involving design, modification,  and/or integration of similar systems.  Should your proposed approach not address all of the areas identified above  your RFI package will still be reviewed. 3.  Your RFI response package should also provide answers to the “Additional  Technical Information Requested” presented at Attachment 3.  The government  understands that not all questions will be applicable to all respondents;  however, you are asked to provide as much information as possible in answering  those questions applicable to your company concerning its  capabilities/expertise.    4. Your package must be submitted within thirty (30) days after publication of  this announcement.  Please provide two (2) paper copies of your response; in  addition, you may also submit in electronic format.  All responses shall be  directed to Capt Jason C. Ortiz, Contract Negotiator, Aeronautical Systems  Center, ASC/YTK, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB,  OH 45433-7211.  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  responding to this RFI please email them to Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil.  FAR  Clause 52.215-3 “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes  (October 1997) is incorporated into this RFI by reference. ///signed/// SALLY L. MEYER Contracting Officer Attachments: 1.Key Performance Parameters 2.System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters 3.Additional Technical Information Requested NOTE:  The Industry Day attendance roster, minutes, and questions from 9-29-03  will be posted the week of 6-10 October.   ///UPDATE END/// UPDATE (9-23-03)  Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>UPDATE (9-23-03) Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to publish the Questions received from Industry, with the Government’s response. Please note, Q7 repeats a question posted on 8 Jan 2004.   A more detailed answer is provided herein.  Q1.  In the Classified Annex, what are the classifications of the parameters and associated values in Tables 1.1 thru 1.5?  A1. UNCLASSIFIED.
Q2.  In Part 1 of 2, "processors with characteristics expected in the operational environment" are called out for both  Breadboard and Brassboard. Can the operational environments differ?  A2.  [1] PRDA USES THE TERM "PROTOTYPE" RATHER THAN "BRASSBOARD".   [2] QUOTED STATEMENT REFERS TO COMPUTATIONAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS.  IN BOTH CASES, ALGORITHM TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING PROCESSORS WITH CHARACTERISTISTICS EXPECTED FOR THE OPERATIONAL DESIGN. FOR THE BREADBOARD CASE, NON-REAL-TIME ALGORITHM DEMONSTRATION IS REQUIRED, VERSUS REAL-TIME IN-FLIGHT ALGORITHM DEMONSTRATION FOR THE PROTOTYPE CASE.  Q3.  In Part 1 of 2, the PDR is stated to be "on/before  01 May 2004". In Part 2 of 2, the PDR is stated to be "as early in Phase 2 as possible, with a goal of having a successful PDR no later than 01 May 2004". Please Clarify.  A3.   THE GOVERNMENT GOAL IS TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PDR WITHIN 30 DAYS OF CONTRACT AWARD.  Q4.  In Part 1 of 2, is the milestone "Demonstrate Automated HRTI 4 production in the laboratory", scheduled for 4Q-FY04, expected to satisfy both the absolute and relative HRTI 4 requirements?   A4. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT EXPECT AUTOMATED ABSOLUTE HRTI RODUCTION THAT EARLY IN PHASE 2, SINCE NECESSARY AUXILLIARY DATA  WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  HOWEVER THE DEMONSTRATED SOFTWARE MUST HAVE ALL NECESSARY  ALGORITHMS  FOR PRODUCING ABSOLUTE HRTI AND BE CAPABLE OF RUNNING IN A SUBOPTIMAL MODE IN THE BSENCE OF NECESSARY AUXILLIARY DATA TO ACHIEVE RELATIVE HRTL 4.  Q5.  On Part 1 of 2 Critical Milestones, "Demonstrate airborne HRTI 4 production" for the Breadboard seems to imply an  on-board processing capability requirement. Please clarify.  A5.  SEE ANSWER TO QUESTION 3  AND BE ADVISED THAT "AIRBORNE" REFERS TO COLLECTION, NOT ONBOARD PROCESSING.  Q6.  In Part 1 of 2 and the PIP, the SOW is stated to be a "pullout attachment". Does the SOW count as part of the 75 page Tech/Mgt Volume limit? Also, does the SOW have to be double-spaced with no font smaller than 12 pitch?  Or, was it meant to be 12 "point" font?  A6.  NO, THE SOW IS NOT COUNTED TOWARDS THE 75 PAGE LIMIT.  TYPE WAS MEANT TO REFLECT 12 POINT FONT.  Q7.  In Part 1 of 2, does the Government intend to provide mission payload requirements and constraints for the C-130, G-4 and/or A-160 as Government-Furnished Information?  A7.  THESE  PLATFORMS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE PRDA AS POSSIBLE OBJECTIVE PLATFORM OPTIONS WHICH BIDDERS MAY CONSIDER IN PLANNING AND PREPARING THEIR PROPOSALS.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PLAN TO PROVIDE ANY PRE-AWARD INFORMATION ON PAYLOAD REQUIREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS FOR THESE PLATFORMS.  FOLLOWING AWARD, DARPA AND ITS TRANSITION PARTNERS WILL WORK WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO DEFINE PAYLOAD REQUIREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS FOR THE ACTUAL SELECTED PLATFORM(S).

THE FACT THAT YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SELECTED FOR A BPA IN NO WAY INDICATES THAT G8SPO WILL NOT CONSIDER YOUR COMPANY AS A SOURCE FOR SOLICITATION OF QUOTES. PRICE, DELIVERY, AND RESPONSIVENESS ARE KEY FACTORS IN DETERMINING AWARD INAL SOLICITATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF AWARD MADE, WHETHER ON A BPA CALL, PURCHASE CARD ORDER , OR PURCHASE ORDER. IN THOSE CASES WHERE A BPA VENDOR PROVES TO BE INADEQUATE OR NON-RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE GOVERNMENT, ADDITIONAL SOURCES WILL BE CONSIDERED.

<CONTACT>Melanie A. Powers, Ph: (360) 315-3384, Fax: (360) 396-7036, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Attn: Supply Department, Code 182, Building 944, 610 Dowell Street, Keyport, WA 98345-7610
<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport is conducting market research to determine the interest and capability of industry for development and integration of an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)/Undersea Warfare (USW) Test Information Management System.  The system will provide information management, data processing, and instrumentation resources.  The ASW/USW Test Information Management structure shall be compliant with DOD Directive 5015.2, Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management-Software Applications, and the relevant Security Classification Guide. This effort encompasses all classes of information associated with life cycle ASW/USW test and evaluation, including prototyping, Developmental Test, Operational Test, Proofing, and In-Service Engineering phases. Information elements are categorized as either programmatic information  or test data, where: (1)Test Programmatic Information includes Test Plans, Test/Work Requests, and Test Reports; and the supporting documentation such as ADCAP and MK54 torpedo and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) Specification Documentation, Test Parameter Requirements (TPR) documents, and instrumentation configuration load files.  (2)Test data is raw, processed, and analyzed range test data available in engineering unit format from a variety of instrumentation or analysis sources throughout the ASW/USW test infrastructure, which includes fixed, portable, and simulation facilities.  It includes digital, analog, video, and audio source data items. Two categories of users are anticipated (1)High Demand Users: Four primary geographically separated locations: NUWC Division Keyport; NUWC Division Keyport, Hawaii Detachment, Oahu, HI; NUWC Division Keyport, San Diego Detachment; NUWC Division Newport.  (2)Lower Demand Users: Government and contractor sites in and around the greater Puget Sound area; Distributed test and training sites throughout the DOD MRTFB infrastructure; Fleet units pier side or underway.  The ASW/USW Test Information Management architecture shall satisfy the following seven objectives.  The technical approach will integrate, to the extent feasible and affordable, each objective.  Solutions proposed may include hardware and software-based upgrades, modification of procedures, and/or any combination of these that clearly integrates each objective area into the over arching Information Management architecture.  Objective 1: Information Exchange, Users will have the ability to exchange, transmit, and receive, programmatic and test data information elements necessary for mission execution.  The capacity and bandwidth of the Test Information Management System  must simultaneously support all end-users using existing Government internet access.  The system will facilitate the test business process in a manner that has been approved by the Government to meet information assurance, and security requirements.  Objective 2: Information Access (1) Within the Test Information Management System, users will have the ability to access and retrieve programmatic and test data information for planning, operations, analysis, and reporting purposes.  All information will be in digital format (where practical), accessible from engineering workstations with Government Internet access.  Search capability will employ DTIC keyword standards and formats; current and archived information will be accessible using standard Government PC software products (i.e.; MS Office Suite, Adobe, Matlab...etc).  Specialized and tailored products will be available from  long-term archives within 24-48 hours; server side processing will be maximized to support data requests within minutes subject to bandwidth restrictions.  Server side processing must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.  Role-based privileges will provide the necessary security and integrity for the system. (2)Operational Availability and Reliability must exceed 95%; local and national backup protocols must be in-place to support downtime periods. (3) Emerging information management concepts, namely "Data Merging" and "Data Mining" are highly desirable attributes if economically achievable within the projected schedule guidelines.  Objective 3: Data Storage (1) Within the Test Information Management System, both test programmatic information and test data must be accessible withi n stated timelines therefore the architecture must have the capability to retain information in both an "immediately accessible" state, and an archived state for long term access.  (2)Based on end-state data management policy; the storage capacity must be readily expandable as further data is collected and legacy information is converted to digital format.  Data storage devices and interfaces must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.  (3)The Test Information Management System seeks to comply, within an acceptable schedule and if proved economically practical and feasible, with common format standards currently in use for ASW/USW systems.  Objective 4: Magnetic and Optical Storage Mediums Within the Test Information Management System, an on-demand capability to retrieve archived leg acy and near term test data from magnetic or optical media will be available to support data requests.  Support turn-around time must not exceed 72 hours from date/time of request.  Conversion and storage of all media must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.  Objective 5: Legacy Non-Digital Data Products  Within: the Test Information Management System, on-demand conversion of legacy ASW/USW programmatic information and test data to digital format is required.  That data must be accessible as described in Objectives 1-3 above.  Keyword search files will be created in MS Word and/or Adobe PDF formats with links to the referenced documents using DTIC guidelines.  Conversion and storage of all paper products must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assura nce guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.  Objective 6: Standardization of Data Products. Within the Test Information Management System, standard data packages will be defined and coordinated with managers and engineers for completeness and quality.  Scripting or other automation mechanisms will be required to support standard data package publication and distribution.  Objective 7: Instrumentation and Data Processing Support.  The Test Information Management System will require integration of many diverse tools, some in use, some being developed, including but not limited to:  (a) Mathworks MatLab with Government sponsored toolkits (e.g. DataInsight) (b) Real time sensor acquisition systems and associated display applications (c) Test/Exercise resource management, planning, and scheduling tools (d) Standard office and publishing tools (Excel, Word, Project, Ad obe PDF, etc.) (e)Document management tools (f)Acoustic and video image processing tools (g)DataProbe/Probe and its derivatives (Charon Probe) (h)Interoperability gateways to accommodate disparate distributed environments. Schedule Objectives are:  (1) FY 2005.  Requirements Definition with parallel Proof-of-Concept Studies; Acquisition, Integration, and Deployment of Tools and Resources. (2) FY 2006.  Integration into the ASW/USW Business Process.  Provide a schedule and/or comments regarding the schedule objectives.  All packages submitted in response to the Request for Information (RFI) should include the following information:  Name and address of company, business size, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, statement of capability, and estimated cost.  The capability package must be clear, and concise.  Capabilities packages must be receiv ed  no later than 3:00 P.M. PST, 2 February 2004.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for a proposal or an invitation for bid, merely a request for information only.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to identify existing commercial off the shelf test information management system, or ongoing or planned development efforts for test data modernization studies.  The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link www.neco.navy.mil and on the Keyport Acquisition homep age at http://kpt-eco.kpt.nuwc.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking any commercial sources capable of manufacturing a kit that provides the ability to position outboard-facing troop seats in the rear cargo bed of the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR).  Capability requested is a centerline seat in the MTVR bed that allows embarked Marines to face outboard.  This capability should not significantly reduce seating capacity nor hinder the ability of Marines to exit the vehicle.

The center seat should be a non-permanent fixture that is stable over rough terrain.  The seat needs to be easily disassembled for stowage on the vehicle and still allow mobile loading of the vehicle.  This proposal may include a reconfiguration of the existing seats, should require minimal or no modification to the vehicle, be able to be assembled and disassembled by a two-man crew, fold out of the way to allow bulk cargo loading without removing the entire assembly, and be used with or without the canvas bed cover.

Commercial firms, which have products with the above characteristics, are invited to submit the following: (1) Product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities and current test results, (2) current GSA contract information, and (3) corporate history. As part of your response, please include information on delivery/lead time (units per month), commercial warranty terms and conditions, and any current GSA or other Government Wide Agency Contracts available to order the supplies.  Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements.  This sources sought / Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Robin J. Kuschel, Bldg. 2201A, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 no later than January 30, 2004.  For further information regarding this RFI or submission of materials, contact Robin Kuschel at (703) 432-3563, e-mail: kuschelrj@mcsc.usmc.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to award a sole source modification for a three-month extension to Texas Research Institute in support of the Nondestructive Testing Information Analysis Center (NTIAC) under contract SPO700-97-D-4003.

Texas Research Institute has the operational capability in place to provide for continuous DoD-wide demand for technical support in the area of Nondestructive Testing/Inspection and Evaluation.  Award to any other source would require transition and start-up time that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling ongoing critical agency requirements.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals.
