The Office of Business Services anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is predicated upon substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The NNSA Service Center requires the use of the SimplyDigi.comcom Learning Management SystemSystem to comply with Federal rules, laws, and regulations, to ensure a well-trained NNSA workforce, and to minimize training cost of NNSA Service Center personnel.  The SimplyDigi.com Learning Management System is proprietary and owned by SimplyDigi.Com, as it was developed by the company.  Therefore SimplyDigi.com is the sole provider of software upgrades, licensing, and support for the SimplyDigi.com Learning Management System.  The applicable NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 611420, with a size standard of $6.5M.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $25,000-$50,000.  Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability by Sept 29, 2007, 2:00 P.M. (MST), to Ms Alicia Williams, Contract Specialist, NNSA, DOE, Office of Business Services, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185; or by E-Mail at awilliams2@doeal.gov.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

I. GENERAL INFORMATION  1. Agency Name  Technical: Naval Health Research Center Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program PO Box 85122 San Diego, CA 92186-5122 Issuing Grants Office: Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Code 230 937 N. Harbor Dr. San Diego, CA 92132-5106 2.  Program Name  Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program 3. Opportunity Title Prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in foreign militaries 4. BAA Number  DHAPP-BAA 07-001  5. Response Dates  Full Proposals are due no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on 30 November 2007.  6. Opportunity Description  6.1 Background  The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support. These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success. The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP.)    DHAPP has successfully engaged over 70 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services. Most recently, DHAPP is a partner USG organization collaborating with the US Department of State, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). DoD representatives participate in PEPFAR country teams, core teams and technical working groups to help formulate the Country Operational Plans (COP) in the assault against HIV. Working closely with US Department of Defense, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on helping countries/militaries implement a program that identifies technical areas in which resources and attention are concentrated, by support of DHAPP resources. DHAPP works with a country and its military based on the following process: •	Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs.  •	Adapt DHAPP support to a countries need for prevention, care, and treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on existing plans and assessments.  •	Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term.  •	Possibly design a program with other country partners who have had successful prevention efforts.  •	Focus on prevention impact through developing country implementation plans.  •	Implement and monitor program to ensure accountability and sustainability.  Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate:  •	Visible support from the military sector  •	Development of plans of action and policies  •	Alignment with PEPFAR strategies and priorities •	Increasing HIV/AIDS awareness within the military sector  •	Country ownership of the activities  •	Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) management, behavioral interventions, prevention and care of other opportunistic infections, and prevention campaigns  •	Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, blood and injection drug use (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission and to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection.)  •	Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and information management.   •	Increasing HIV and HIV/TB care and treatment programs More information about countries DHAPP currently operates in and its existing programs can be found on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/index.html .   6.2 Program Purpose and Plan DHAPP continues to rely upon the vital support of various partners, such as non-governmental organizations, in implementing HIV/AIDS programs across the globe.  Each country has a customized plan to help the country/military bring its HIV/AIDS programs to sufficient scale to help reduce the spread of the epidemic and mitigate its impact.  DHAPP’s current priority activities include the following: -	training of master trainers and peer educators -	“Troop Level” HIV/AIDS prevention education and behavior change communication -	Providing infrastructure and equipment for HIV testing  -	Increasing testing of all military personnel -	Developing HIV laboratory diagnostic capability -	Increasing clinical capability for health care of those infected with HIV -    Effective implementation of monitoring and evaluation procedures This BAA is intended to solicit existing partners and establish new ones in order to expand the DHAPP/PEPFAR program.  Interested sources should submit proposals identifying their plans and capabilities per information in Section IV, Application and Submission information.   Proposals should focus on rapidly extending HIV/AIDS services to additional clients.  Respondents are encouraged to target specific needs with a practical, pragmatic business plan, using small grass-roots organizations to provide community based services as a way to enhance organic capabilities and sustainability. 6.3 Sources of Funding The source of funds is the Department of State’s Global AIDS Program (GAP) to implement the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR.)  The overall program manager for this is the Department of State’s Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), with DHAPP supplying intermediate support for military specific programs.  Countries’ programs supported by PEPFAR funds can be found on the OGAC website: http://www.state.gov/s/gac/.  PEPFAR funds require additional certifications as identified on page 3 of Attachment 1. PEPFAR funds require distinct reports as identified on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/proposals/reporting.html   Respondents should be aware that this BAA covers both programs.  The respondents’ proposals will be reviewed for both funding sources.   7. Points of Contact:  Questions shall be directed to the cognizant Grants Officer, as specified below, who will direct technical questions to the appropriate Desk Officer. Maria Papet Grants Officer Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Code 230  San Diego, CA 92132-5106 (619 532-2559 maria.papet@navy.mil  8. Instrument Type  It is anticipated that awards resulting from this announcement will be grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts.  9. Additional Information: This BAA is soliciting proposals for Fiscal Year 2008.  II. AWARD INFORMATION  Anticipated Award Information is as follows:  For PEPFAR awards:  Grants are expected to be for a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of three (3) years. For each award, the HIV Team anticipates obligating between $100,000-$3,500,000 per year to a partner. Requested program activities and anticipated annual funding levels for each country are provided in Attachment 2.  Funds for this activity are provided through The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (also referred to as The Emergency Plan).  The Emergency Plan is an ambitious five year, $15 billion initiative that aims at treating 2 million HIV infected persons with Anti-Retroviral drugs, preventing 7 million new infections and providing Care and Support to 10 million people living with HIV/AIDS and AIDS orphans worldwide.  The Emergency Plan is being implemented by several USG agencies: Health and Human Services, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of State, Peace Corps, the US Department!   of Labor, and United States Agency for International Development (USAID).   As with all USDOD grants, support is contingent on the availability of funding.  The issuance of this BAA does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the USG, nor does it commit the USG to pay costs incurred in the preparation and submission of any application.  USDOD reserves the right to fund any or none of the applications submitted and to negotiate separately with an applicant if such an action is considered to be in the interest of the USG.  Awards will be made on a rolling basis over a one year time period.  Funding will be approved for the initial year activities and will be subject to the available funding and partner performance for each subsequent requested year of support.  USDOD is planning for a program of up to $26,000,000 per year over the next one to three years. Number of Awards: approximately 30  Award Types: Grants, Cooperative Agreements, or Contracts Anticipated Period of Performance for Awards:  The proposed period of performance will be from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2011 subject to the availability of funding.  However, proposals may describe activities covering no less than one year and no more than three years. Range of Approval/Disapproval Time: Formal proposals are reviewed and selected within six months from submission.  Subsequent awards are usually made within three months from notification. This information is only an approximate estimate and does not obligate the US Government in any way.  Estimated funding amounts may increase or decrease at any times based on current and future appropriations.  III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION  All responsible sources from academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations may submit proposals under this BAA.  No grants may be awarded directly to foreign military establishments.  All respondents must demonstrate the active support of the in-country military in the planning and execution of their proposals.  SEE "Upload Attachment File" for complete package.

<DESC>This is a market survey for support services for the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) Program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with this submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense. This requirement was previously advertised in October 2006, however, we received a very limited number of acceptable/relevant responses from SEDB and SB.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  Since the first market survey was released, the SOW has been revised to show emphasis on the aviation safety aspect of the requirement and the job descriptions and qualifications have been more clearly defined.  Contractors interested in performing this requirement must clearly demonstrate competence to perform in both the aviation safety analysis discipline and the information technology discipline.  It is anticipated that the contract will be Time and Materials - Labor Hour Type contract with fixed hourly rates for each of the labor categories.  Travel and Materials will be cost-reimbursable.   The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all types of businesses to include large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the services required in the SOW. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists among business with the capabilities required in the SOW to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541519, Other Computer Related Services, with a size standard of $21M.    Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: â€¢        Type of services provided by your firm,  â€¢        Size and type of services provided on previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information, personnel qualifications and past performance to include contract numbers and length of contract)  â€¢        Number of years in business 2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.   Attached is a draft of the Statement of Work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.  All responses to this market survey must be received by 28 Sep 2007.   All submittals should be submitted to:  michelle.shaw@faa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).   Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to negotiate on a sole source basis with Agencourt Bioscience Corp 500 Cummings Center, Suite 2450, Beverly, MA 01915 to perform custom sequencing of DNA samples.  By utilizing high throughput sequencing methods this vendor can provide results of identifying gene defects in various patient samples within 2 weeks. This is key as patients present with numerous diseases being studied by Labs within NHGRI.  It would take the NHGRI labs at least one month to process the patient samples, costing more in time, money, supplies and equipment use.  In addition to being able to provide high throughput for quick turnaround time this vendor has custom designed primers for each exon/amplicon of Panels A-E.  This is an advantage because it gives the ability to process or run  any amount of samples with the same primers sets and conditions with no additional cost associated with it.

The sole source determination is based upon the use of this particular custom sequencing services from Agencourt Bioscience Corporation as it relates to the genetic disease studies for the National Human Genome Research Institute.  We must continue to purchase these items in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into the experimental results and to avoid long delays resulting from retesting of products from other potential suppliers.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for laboratory portable spectroreflectometer (1 each). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from AZ Technology. The government requires a portable optical instrument used for quickly measuring total hemispherical spectral reflectance. The instrument makes measurements over the solar region of the spectrum, 250nm to 2800nm, which is a necessary wavelength range for surface measurements of materials encountered by various NASA/Johnson Space Center flight programs.  The measurements are of the absolute type provided by the integrating sphere measurement technique for almost any shape, size or type of surface. The instrument connects to a portable laptop computer and provides a real-time display of the acquired spectrum. The relative light weight (less than 15 pounds) of the instrument allows for portability to the location of the hardware surface. Portability is necessary feature since various flight samples cannot be transferred to automatic measurement scan of the entire wavelength range. Existing market research shows that AZ Technology laboratory portable spectroreflectometer 300 (LPSR 300) is the only instrument that can meet government technical requirements.  AZ Technology is the only vendor that can provide the LPSR 300. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 20, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>DARPA would like to encourage new faculty members at institutions of higher learning to participate in its programs.  This Research Announcement offers a venue by which research ideas proposed by young faculty can be sponsored and promoted within the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) at DARPA.  The Young Faculty Award (YFA) is expected to provide MTO with revolutionary research ideas that are critical to future technology developments.  

This solicitation is for single-author grant proposals for concept development and validation in one, or combinations of, the following thrust areas of interest to MTO: 1) electronics, 2) photonics, 3) micro and nano electro mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), 4) architectures, and 5) algorithms.  Proposers must select one of these thrust areas for their proposal and identify this thrust on the cover page.  Proposed research should focus on innovations that enable revolutionary advances in physics, materials, and devices.  Speculative and high-risk ideas are strongly encouraged.  The proposal should clearly state the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and critical milestones the YFA research activity will address.  Note the problem statement can be broader than the focused effort addressed in the first year of research, but the interrelationship of the two must be clearly articulated.  The initial research should focus on a clearly defined problem which can be answered in a 12 to 18-month activity consisting of critical analysis, design, or experimental exploration.  MTO expects that successful YFA efforts will be a precursor and proof of a concept solution to a larger problem that is sufficiently important and challenging to warrant a follow-on, full-scale DARPA program embodied in a future Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  This solicitation is limited to participation by young investigators as defined in the Proposer Eligibility section.

<DESC>A/B MAC CYCLE 2 ? JURISDICTIONS 6, 11, 14 & 15

Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The MAC?s will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 6 (comprised of the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), Jurisdiction 11 (comprised of the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia), Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and Jurisdiction 15 (compromised of the states of Kentucky and Ohio).    

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of seven stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four one-year options.  CMS anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about August 30, 2007.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four DME MACs under contract to CMS.     The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME PSCs).     These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function.

The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare.

The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to     1. coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); 2. provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; 3. provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; 4. develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs; and, 5. establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations.

The successful offeror must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS.     There are no exceptions to this requirement; offers which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.

In addition, the successful offeror:

- must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days);

- must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame;

- will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier;

- must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors;

- must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and

- must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes.

CMS intends to issue a solicitation for a competitive procurement for the PDAC Contractor - Medicare Administrative Contractor (PDAC MAC). It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<SUBJECT>D -- Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) Contractor to support Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)
<SOLNBR>RFP-CMS-2007-0021
<RESPDATE>082307
<CONTACT>John Webster, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-7229, Fax 410-786-9922, Email John.Webster@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to develop a Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) front-end application for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) claims processing contractors.  

Currently, front end Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing for DME claims occurs in 4 separate systems. Two of these systems are operated by DME MACs and two are operated by data services contractors under direct contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The front-end EDI systems perform edits on incoming Medicare DME claims and forwards the output data from transactions that pass edits to the core of the VMS shared system claims processing environment. Each of the 4 systems used for DME front end transaction processing has been developed as a proprietary system to meet its developer?s own business objectives. Logic specific to Medicare requirements was added to accommodate the Medicare claims transactions.  Also, these EDI environments accept data files from the VMS shared system processing to create transactions to be sent to EDI trading partners (e.g., banks, suppliers, providers, other CMS contractors), in the form of claims payment remittance advice transactions and claims status response transactions.  The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) transactions currently passes through an exchange with VMS for both inbound and outbound transactions.

Since each system is owned and developed by separate entities, variations exist in the way in which individual front end systems process claims and in the results they produce. Accordingly, the results of transaction editing can vary from system to system for a given transaction type and can result in similar transactions being rejected by some systems while being approved by others. This creates confusion with suppliers and beneficiaries. It can also lead to the rejection of eligible claims as well as the payment of ineligible claims depending upon which front end system processed the transaction.

The CEDI DME MAC front-end system shall be discrete to the contractor and shall not be integrated with any other commercial application and processing environment. The primary functions of the CEDI DME MAC front-end system generally will include: 

?	An electronic mailbox system for suppliers to submit claims as well as offer customer support; 
?	Conducts EDI translation activities for all ANSI ASC X12 4010A1 files and future versions adopted by Federal regulation promulgated by DHHS and/or CMS.  The use of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software is preferred, but optional, at contract award; however, the use of COTS software is required before contract option year 2.
?	NCPDP Routing and translation services (optional at contract award but required before contract option year 1);
?	Connectivity support for EDI users;
?	EDI enrollment; 
?	Free Billing Software (FBS) distribution and support; 
?	Submitter profile changes and updates;
?	Transaction testing; 
?	EDI helpdesk support; and 
?	Misdirected claims and acknowledgement transfer service between the 4 DME MACs.

In order to be considered for this requirement an offeror:

?	must be able to demonstrate their experience with, and current and direct access to, VMS shared system claims processing environment.  

?	must currently process DME claims for adjudication and payment in an active production EDI environment.  

There are no exceptions to the requirements listed under the first two bullet points; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.  

?	must possess, at the minimum, Capability Maturity Model? Integration (CMMI) Level II accreditation at contract award.  The offeror must be able to achieve CMMI Level III accreditation before contract option year 2.

?	must be able to determine the best approach for transitioning the workload (68,850,000 annual claims) from the current four DME MAC front-end systems.  

?	must have existing EDI staff familiar with Medicare front-end systems, or show the ability to recruit and train new staff within a short period of time, in order to perform the functions described in this Sources Sought Notice.  The CEDI system must be fully operational for all DME MAC claims in approximately four months from date of award.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the CEDI DME MAC. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a competitive requirement.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 30, 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP) Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) intends to award a sole source Purchase Order to Tekran Instuments Corporation under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures for two Ambient Mercury Trace Level Monitoring Systems and a Mercury Calibration Unit.  Tekran Instruments Corporation is the only known source able to provide the required systems with the following attributes to the  Government:  Ambient Mercury Trace Level Monitoring Systems: 1. The analyzer shall be a self-contained, rack mountable unit, with internal pump, user-serviceable pre-concentration traps, heaters, mass-flow meter & controllers, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence detector, and calibration source.  2. A  portable unit that may be used indoors or in the field to monitor background vapor-phase mercury levels to a detection level in the *sub-ng/m3* regime at a cycle time of 5 minutes or less. 3. The analyzer must be capable of operation without an external data-logger or computer, and should possess  analog, digital and RS-232 outputs to allow it to be integrated with a serial data-logger, PC-based data system or any air quality telemetry system. 4. The analyzer must be equipped with dual, gold-column amalgamation cartridges which allow for true, continuous sampling of an air stream, with no  gaps in the data collected. While one cartridge is sampling ambient air the other is in the process of being analyzed. 5. The mercury vapor cartridges should be made of pure gold, and should be able to withstand many thousands of sampling and desorption cycles without degradation in performance. 6.  The duty cycle must be sufficiently short as to allow for near-real-time data collection, with a minimum rate of not more than 2.5 minutes per cycle. 7. The analyzer must be equipped with an internal mercury calibration source that allows the instrument to re-calibrate itself automatically; thus  allowing unattended operation for extended periods of time. 8. The analyzer must be equipped with a bypass valve that prevents contaminated air from coming in contact with the detector, thus making cleaning operations infrequent. 9. The detector in the analyzer must have an inert gas purge feature  to improve stability, thus necessitating only infrequent adjustments to the GAIN and SENSITIVITY controls. 10. The analyzer must utilize an electronic mass-flow meter or controller to measure ambient air sample flow rate. If using a mass flow meter, the analyzer must utilize a microprocessor  controlled feedback loop between the mass flow meter and pump to ensure accurate sample flow rates and sample volume measurements. 11. The analyzer must use an electronic mass-flow controller to regulate carrier gas flow during analysis, and should automatically shut off gas flow in the event of a  power failure. This allows optimal usage of the UHP Argon carrier gas. 12. The analyzer must use an electronic mass-flow controller to regulate carrier gas flow during analysis, and should automatically shut off gas flow in the event of a power failure. This allows optimal usage of the UHP Argon  carrier gas. Mercury Calibration Unit:  1. Compatible with existing EPA/CAMD mercury sampling equipment, manufactured by the Tekran Corporation. 2. Utilize a syringe to manually inject a precisely known amount of elemental mercury into the analyzer to be calibrated. 3. Interface directly with  digital syringes allowing continuous measurement of volume and instantaneous calculation of injection amount. 4. Rugged and self-contained, and portable to make it suitable for laboratory or field use. 5. Small (less than 16 x 12 x 12 inches) and weigh less than 12 pounds for portability. 6. Draw  less than 2.5 amps max (12 VDC) when operating on battery power. 7. Precisely regulate the temperature of the elemental mercury reservoir with a thermoelectric cooler, not a water bath, and precisely measure chamber temperatures and display them with digital display.  8. Operate with line power or  battery backup (12 VDC). 9. On-board microprocessor to automatically calculate amount of mercury injected based on either measurements or input temperature and volume. 10. Serial port to allow logging of injections, temperatures and other instrument parameters. 11. Contain a pool of liquid mercury  within a Teflon? vessel, entirely enclosed within an insulated isothermal block. A Teflon? backed silicone septum must be used to seal the vessel. 12.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Planmeca USA 100 N. Gary Avenue, Suite A, Roselle, IL 60172, as the only responsible source that can provide the a Digital Panoramic Unit with Cone Beam Tomography that interface with the Planmeca Digital Imaging System as requirement by Naval Hospital Sigonella, Italy. This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 are incorporated.

Naval Hospital Sigonella has a need for an advanced digital panoramic system with a small field Cone Beam Tomography and 3D diagnostic capabilities.  This allows facility to perform normal and advanced panoramic images studies and 3D volumetric Tomography all in one unit.  This technology is ideal for the type of the maxiofacial and orthodontic procedures that this hospital provides.  A standard digital panoramic unit doesn?t have all the required capabilities. The Planmeca manufactured PROMAX digital panoramic device is the only vendor that utilizes SCARA technology as well as a software enhancement capability that is utilized for ?opening the space? of the inter-proximate teeth/overlap of a panoramic x-ray.  The PROMAX in the only panoramic unit that can provide inter-proximal spacing images (bitewing style images).  These can often be the sole radiograph used to diagnose CLASS 3 carries ? thus eliminating the additional requirements for bitewings and exposing the patient and staff to additional radiation.  The PROMAX panoramic unit currently is the only known manufactured device that does NOT require a mandatory ?cool down? between each patient or between each image exposure.  This is extremely important during surge and mobilization events.

A full field cone beam CT (CBCT) units provide more information than is needed at a far greater price.  This unit will be replacing an older Planmeca model that has very similar user interface reducing the training requirements.  Implementing a different system or two separate units (one standard Panoramic unit and one Cone Beam Computed Tomography unit) will require more resources and time to acquire and wire the additional space.   

Items being purchased in this acquisition:
ProMax 3D Panoramic System Complete; ProMax Panoramic - Digital; 3D Sensor Head for CBVT; 3D Reconstruction PC for CBVT (HP); 3D Tube Head Assembly For CBVT; Primary Collimator, 3D; 3D Patient Support; 3D Ball Phantom; Fluorescent Screen for Pan - 3D (5 lines); Romexis (Basic) 3D Software; Wall sensor holder; DIMAXIS 10-User Network License; DICOM License/Soft, Gateway; N-Liten 3D Software Kit; N-Liten 3D Software; N-Liten 3D Server Key; N-Liten 3D Acquisition or Viewing Key; Installation for CBVT ProMax.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339114 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD intends to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(b) with Canberra Industries, Meriden, CT, the Genie 2000 and lab equipment upgrade system. (SYS #:  969179)  The system will upgrade the Genie 2000 the USUHS currently uses.  The existing Genie 2000 will serve as a full backup to the system required by the reactor division.  The reactor division routinely uses the detectors and counters from one set with the mainframe from the other.  This allows the reactor division to ensure that all license requirements are met within the regulatory timeframe allowed.  Over the years, this redundancy has prevented numerous surveillance shortfalls allowing the reactor division to maintain license compliance.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office by September 25, 2007.  Interested parties may send responses to the following address: USUHS, Directorate of Contracting, A1040C, and Attn:  Christina Johnson, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 OR e-mail address:  cjohnson@usuhs.mil.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) intends to award a performance-based, service contract to implement as a pilot program for Chemical Management Services (CMS) at Tinker AFB. The solicitation will be full and open.  The purpose of the Department of Defense (DoD) CMS program is to provide a strategic, performance-based initiative where a CMS provider manages the rapid replenishment of HAZMAT and related services in support of a customer?s requirements.  The goals of this CMS program go beyond invoicing and delivering product to the customer and include the emphasis of optimization of processes, the continual reduction of chemical lifecycle costs, and the reduction of risks and impacts to employees and the environment.  The type of contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), single award in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The contract period is a 3 year base with two potential option periods of twelve months each, for a potential total of 5 years.  Formal source selection procedures will apply.  The CMS provider will be a single point of contact for all chemical requirements at Tinker AFB and is responsible for performing chemical material support functions currently performed by site/base personnel.  Items typically covered in a CMS program are cataloged under, but are not limited to, Fed-Std-313D which includes the following Federal Supply Classes (FSC) containing HAZMAT:  4210, 4220, 6810, 6820, 6830, 6840, 6850, 6930, 7930, 8010, 8030, 8040, 9110, 9130, 9135, 9150, and 9160.  Other FSCs not listed in Table I or II of Fed-Std-313D, which are considered HAZMAT, may be included.  The CMS provider may be responsible for any/all of the following: 1) demand analysis & forecasting, 2) purchasing of HAZMAT, 3) inventory management, 4) distribution to point of use (POU), 5) environmental management support, 6) continual improvement activities, and 7) information technology capability.  CMS transformation involves lean and cellular design whereby traditional large, chemical products and services are centralized and can be tailored to meet site specific requirements.  As part of a CMS objective, the service provider will manage chemical inventories so that a minimum quantity is on hand for customer bench stock and retail inventory is kept to a minimum as well.  Because of this transformation effort, the service provider will need to be responsive, agile, versatile, and reactive to a changing environment for chemical management support.  A copy of the solicitation and all other applicable information will be available at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/UserWeb/FAGA/cms.htm.  The anticipated issue date is late Sept / early October 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, it is the intent of the 21st Cavalry Brigade to negotiate on a sole source basis with Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE), 5750 E McKellips Road, BLDG 100, Mesa AZ  85215 (480) 981-6898, FAX (480) 981-6899.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services. Requirement calls for the purchase of additional Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (TESS) equipment and parts to repair and upgrade current systems to enhance the training of US Army and allied nat ions units equipped with the AH-64D Longbow. This purchase includes upgraded Instrumentation Player Units designed to use the latest satellite technology in support of the Longbow Unit Fielding and Training Program (UFTP), providing better tracking of air  and ground assets during collective training events. These upgraded units will not only increase the tracking capability of the various systems during training events, but also provide improved playbacks during mission After Action Reviews (AARs). The pur chase of Man Worn Tracking Systems will add to the realism of training by allowing the tracking of individual soldiers and aviators during training events. ICE is developing a system that is much lighter, approximately 2 pounds, and is the size of the stan dard issued survival radio, and fits into the currently issued survival vest, body armor, and Load Bearing Equipment. The acquisition of these man worn systems will greatly enhance the capability to track and engage dismounted soldiers and aviators simulat ing being shot down, while also increasing the safety of these personnel by being able to locate them at any given second in time. The Shoot Back Lasers, unique to TESS are eye safe laser weapons that can be dismounted from a vehicle and used by dismounted  troops to engage and destroy aircraft. Presently, that capability does not exist in the brigades arsenal of training systems. The purchase of Hand Held Initializers greatly increases the capability of brigade personnel to electronically load data into,  or reconfigure weapons loads on aircraft and ground systems in an expeditious manner, using wireless technology, before, during, and after training missions, requiring fewer personnel and man hours to perform this task. A major component of the TESS is a training Hellfire missile which is mounted on each aircraft during training events. Each training missile weighs 99 pounds. The purchase of a cart to transport, store, and protect these missiles will aid in reducing the time requirements to transport missi les from the storage area to the aircraft and reduce the potential for damage during transport. The trailer will also provide a protected storage rack between training events. The ground and air TESS systems presently in use by the 21st Cavalry Brigade hav e been in almost continuous use since 1998 with very little or no upgrades or repairs. If these systems are to remain available, and functional, for future training events, they must be repaired, upgraded as necessary, and protected when not in use. The re mainder of this purchase request is for parts unique to the TESS systems and cannot be purchased locally. The approval of this purchase request will greatly enhance the realism of the training provided by the 21st Cavalry Brigade in preparing these attack helicopter crews for future combat operations.

PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for FA8601-07-R-0045, Project Number ZHTV 050033B,  Repair 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC-Phase II ABW HQ , Facility 30010,  Area C,  WPAFB.  Period of Performance is 365 days. The overall estimated  price range is between $ 1M and $ 5M. The solicitation is an unrestricted  acquisition, full-and-open competition.

Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2.

<DESC>A/B MAC CYCLE 2 ? JURISDICTIONS 6, 11, 14 & 15

Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The MAC?s will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 6 (comprised of the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), Jurisdiction 11 (comprised of the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia), Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and Jurisdiction 15 (compromised of the states of Kentucky and Ohio).    

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of four stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four one-year options.  CMS anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about August 30, 2007.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) on behalf of the United States Attorney?s Office Eastern District of Michigan invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 and 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Re-surfacing of System Furniture Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by September 17, 2007 at 12:00 p.m. (EST).  This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on technical capability, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.   The Proposals shall include the following information:

(1) Sufficient detail that demonstrates contractor?s technical capability to meet the requirements outlined in the statement of work.  The contractor must demonstrate the following:

A)	Personnel is experienced and proficient in removing fabric from Haworth Systems furniture panels and corner posts, cutting fabric to fit panels and posts and recovering panels and posts.
B)	Provide sufficient staff during the timeframes described in the statement of work to complete work within the stated period of performance.
C)	Properly dispose of the removed fabric and work area is clean/free from material on a daily basis.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor?s experience demonstrating the contractor?s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT: General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in leasing between 5,900 and 6,150 rentable square feet of space in Bismarck, ND.  The rentable area must yield between 5,098 and 5,340 ANSI BOMA office area square feet.  The space will be occupied by the Census Bureau for operations associated with the 2010 Census enumeration.  The Census Bureau intends to occupy the built-out space by September 2, 2008.  The Lessor will be required to fund the tenant improvement costs and amortize the cost over the term of the lease.   

LEASE TERM:  Two (2) years and four (4) months fully serviced with cancellation rights after twenty-three (23) months.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS: The Government prefers that the space be contiguous and located on one floor.  If the offered space is located on two floors, the upper floor must be contiguous and configured in such a way that it is stacked directly above the adjoining space on the lower floor. Space cannot be located on more than two floors or be non-contiguous.   If the space is located in a building with two or more stories, the Government requires that the building provide at least one elevator, which must be a handicap accessible public elevator with freight capability.  The space configuration shall be conducive to an efficient layout.  Consideration for an efficient layout will include, but will not be limited to, the following: size and location of interior fire (support) walls, size and number of columns, column placement, bay depths, window size and placement, convector size and placement, electrical and telephone accessibility, any angles, curves or offsets that will result in an inefficient use of space.  The following space configurations will not be considered: space split by a public corridor; space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a commercially zoned area and shall not be located near railroad tracks or other land uses that negatively impact normal business operations.  Space shall not be located within a flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  Space should not be 1) located in a building housing federal, state, or local law enforcement, tax authorities, courts and associated court-related services,  immigration services, or social service agencies; 2) located in a building housing a US Department of Homeland Security agency; or 3)  located in a building housing drug treatment or prisoner detention. The agency shall have access to its space 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The Government requires a fully serviced lease including the provision of possible overtime utility service with the number of hours required to be established by the Government. The Government requires a loading dock (or acceptable alternative such as a scissor lift) and adequate maneuvering room for ongoing truck deliveries.  The Government requires a total of three (3) parking spaces in close proximity of the space for employees included as part of the lease.  In addition, there must be at least fifty (50) parking spaces available for free, fee or lease within three (3) blocks of the building with handicap parking availability.  Parking spaces in commercial lots shall be available throughout the day, and be within commercial rates.   The space must be located within three (3) blocks of public transportation and a variety of dining establishments.

LOCATION: The space must be located within the following boundaries:

Interstate 94, Tyler Parkway, and Century Ave to the north
	
Centennial Road, Industrial Dr and N Bismarck Expressway (810) to the east

Bismarck Expressway (810), Airport Road, and East Wachter Ave, to the south

S Washington St and Bismarck Expressway (810) to the west.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 1) Building name and address, 2) One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, 3) BOMA Square footage offered, 4) Method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet, 5) Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted, and 6) Evidence of authority to represent the owner.  

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS: In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to explore commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to aircraft cargo loading/unloading in a minimum amount of time.  The system proposed should have the capability to handle a total of 18 463L pallets at one time.  Through this RFI, the US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is requesting information concerning mature technologies that meet these requirements.       

This system is being evaluated as part of a C-17 pit-stop operation designed to reduce over-all ground time to quick-turn aircraft.  The unit must be mobile with the capability to be moved into place behind the aircraft and allow rapid unloading of the entire cargo bay area (up to 18 pallet positions of cargo at a max pallet weight of 10,355 lbs.).  Once the cargo is loaded, the unit must be able to be moved rapidly to a position 25' beyond the wingtip and be capable of rapidly transferring cargo to another cargo handling unit such as a Tunner (60K).  This unit should be designed with as much automaiton as possible to move cargo on and off the unit with minimal personnel.  The cargo handling unit will be required to operate in all seasonal weather conditions encountered at McGuire AFB.  Reliability and maintainability are key design considerations.  Other design considerations: Catwalks along the edge with removable safety rails to allow personnel to work around cargo pallets in a safe manner.  Length of each segment must be capable of holding a 6 pallet position train.  Adjustable height deck (at minimum the aircraft-interface area) with capability to adjust to the angle the aircraft may be parked on.  Capability to spin the pallets.  Cargo could be loaded long or short-wise on the aircraft.  Safety devices to prevent the pallets from rolling off the deck.  i.e. pallet stops.  Capability to approach with an aircraft loader from minimum 3 sides.  Wide enough with adjustable pallet rails to load pallets on the deck in either length.  Easy to replace all weather rollers.  Motorized deck to move pallets.  Lighting capability for night-time ops. Under deck storage for spare equipment, tie down, shoring (wood), and maybe even some aircraft maintenance equipment (i.e. ground wires, wheel chocks, etc.)
Forklift tine access to load/unload the deck. Pallet locking capability. Built with shaped metal decking to allow traction when manually pushing loads (better than non-skid paint that wears over time). Applicable safety warning devices.


This Request For Information (RFI) may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.   SUBMISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until 22 Oct 07.  White papers should not exceed five pages and should include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to include level of effort and labor catagories.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Battlelab at battlelab@mcguire.af.mil.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS CAPT JOHN YERGER.  You may contact Major Honsinger with any questions at (609) 754-7608.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL AMB INFORMATION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.  GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:     The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals.   Point of Contact Questions on the objectives or preparation of the white paper and/or technical proposal should be addressed to Capt Jessica Williams, Air Mobility Battlelab, 5656 Texas Ave, Ft Dix, NJ 08640, Commercial (609) 754-7938, battlelab@mcguire.af.mil. Questions related to contracting or cost issues should be directed to Ms. Karin Quagliato, karin.quagliato@mcguire.af.mil, Commercial (609)-754-2525 or Mrs. Roseclair Thompson at roseclair.thompson@mcguire.af.mil, Commercial (609) 754-5927.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes.  The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

The 526 ICBMSG/PKA, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential sources to modify the Air Force Airborne Procedures Trainer (APT), associated with the Minuteman III Weapons System. This modification would result in upgrading the APT trainer to match the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCC) modifications being made by the US Navy to the Airborne Command Post (EA6B). The APT is a TEMPEST-certified caged classroom trainer used to train (ground-side) crew members in ICBM-related ALCC procedures. In this action the government is seeking to locate alternate sources (to the Prime Team) which would be qualified to bid for this FY10 modification project. The current APT includes a partial Battle-Staff right-hand console, a Communications Integrator Cabinet, simulated EA6B aircraft features, instructor areas, computer equipment to drive the simulation and trainer software and hardware. These modifications, defined in an AF 1067, would replace the current Digital Airborne Intercommunications Switching Set (DAISS) with an upgraded version, would add an interactive Intelligence Officer Station and would also incorporate new Battle-Staff consoles, keyboards and trackballs. 

The ICBM Prime Team of Northrop-Grumman Corporation with The Boeing Company is the only currently qualified source, and currently performs support, maintenance, and operation of the APT. The Government seeks alternate sources to the ICBM Prime Team to perform the APT modification effort (only).  The alternate source should provide qualifications responses to each of the 16 numbered requirements below, and also describe how it would propose to manage the APT modification program, describe the qualifications and relevant experiences (to the ICBM program) of its management, engineering and technical personnel, who would work on the APT program, and describe the corporate facilities relevant to the APT modification. Subject to the Governments consideration, a viable alternate source should submit a concise, APT program-specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they possess necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements (below), and that they have facilities and employees with satisfactory qualifications, experience, and ICBM-specific experiences to perform this activity without undue technical, schedule or cost risks. In addition, any viable alternate sources, not currently qualified, would be required to conduct a demonstration of capability prior to contractor certification as a source for the APT modification effort. The alternate source is requested to describe the plan (and schedule), that demonstrates the alternate sources capability to perform all tasks required.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract would be based upon responses to information received, and would be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All sources would be required to satisfy the following requirements, as a minimum, in accomplishing the APT modification: 1) re-host the current hardware and software simulation, based in ADA and operated in a VAX 4000 environment, to a current computer technology and operating system (i.e. SUN Solaris/UNIX, Micro-Soft Windows, etc.), and to adapt this computer equipment & operating system to the new or retained trainer hardware; 2) re-host all existing training scenarios and script and develop new scripting of intelligence and other modifications-related scenarios, messaging and aircraft features to accommodate EA6B aircraft modifications, as related to communications and other modification actions affecting the current APT; 3) work off-site in their own qualified facilities to develop this modified simulation suite, perform DT&E with test plans and procedures at this site, and then  4) deliver, perform modifications, installations and acceptance testing, with directives, plans and procedures for the new and modified functions and the overall system test at the APT site, observing all TEMPEST and facility requirements, and providing other support (CAP, configuration management, hazardous waste management, MILSTRIP, etc.) as required to fulfill the perspective contract, 5) provide a user manual for all new, modified and existing functions and scenarios, 6) train the Prime subcontractor (Boeing) and USAF instructor team in the use and maintenance of the re-hosted and modified simulation suite, and 7) establish the parts and spares involved in this modification action list and make overall maintenance (hardware and software) and repair recommendations for the new COTS and other AF and APT-unique items, 8) provide T.O updates, new and revised hardware drawings, and other necessary documentation, as required, and in coordination with the Prime Team. The following requirements and experiences are generalized to this trainer modification design activity: 9) certain members of the development team would be required to hold Top-Secret clearances in order to be granted access to certain APT program materials, 10) the development team would be required to have proven experience in the development and maintenance of large-scale ADA programs (Size: 1+Mlines of source code with FORTRAN/C/VAX control language and extents) hosted in VAX 4000 systems and other operating systems as necessary to select and design the proper computer platform and software suite for this application. The perspective source would have experience in developing ADA software applications, using COTS systems, with special-purpose hardware, large control scripts & client-server applications (with multiple users and interrupts), large military databases, and fielding/testing of instructor & scenario-controlled military trainer systems. The alternate source would have active experience in: 11) ICBM and ALCC procedures, functions and operations, emergency procedures, EAPs and messaging, and NPES, 12) AF airborne and satellite intelligence and operations, 13) AF airborne and satellite communications and operations, 14) AF global information network including NIPRNET and SIPRNET, 15) cryptographic systems, 16) aircraft ground-side trainer management, development, operations and maintenance. 

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).  In addition to providing the above information, firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address, and indicate business size status.  The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.

Responses may be mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, Rm 26, Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, Attention: Kirk Dean.  Responses must be received no later than close of business (COB) 2:00 PM Nov. 15, 2007.  Please identify your response with the corresponding Program Title: Sources Sought: Airborne Procedures Trainer.

General Information  Document Type: Sources Sought Announcement Posted Date: 9/14/07 Response Date: 9/19/07 Classification Code: D - Information technology services, including telecommunications services NAICS Code: 541512  Computer Systems Design Services Contracting Office Address:  ACA, ITEC4-West, 2133 Cushing St, Bldg. 61801, Room 3212, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613-7070 Description of Action:  The Government intends to award a contract for Standardized Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software under the authority of 10 U.S.C. §2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy age ncy requirements, Application for brand name description. The COTS software licenses and software maintenance and support will be utilized to support Enterprise Level requirements of added functionality and upgrades to existing licenses in support of the B rooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) IMD Customer Service Desk. Description of Supplies/Services:  Standardized COTS software is required for trouble ticket management for network operations for BAMC to track and manage mission critical services, communications network events, outages, restorations and requests for net work services.  Remedy software provided by BMC Software is currently used to provide these functions.  BAMC requires additional functionality and licenses, beyond what is currently provided in the Remedy software, to support emerging requirements for the BRAC-mandated consolidation with Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC).  This additional functionality will be provided through an upgrade to the Remedy software currently in use, in conjunction with additional licenses purchased.  This software will provide BAMC with operational tools to share information and work orders with WHMC, as well as all other Army and DoD components, if required.  The software upgrade will also provide improved service for all aspects of incidents, problems, assets, services, and cu stomers enterprise-wide. Reason for Authoriy Cited:  BAMC has used the Remedy software identified above, and earlier versions, since 1998, to serve as the local enterprise solution for its area of responsibility.  As a result, this software is thoroughly integrated, compatible and  interoperable with its existing systems as well as other BAMC enterprise-level systems.  This software is also utilized within the Joint community (e.g., DISA and Combatant Commanders), which gives DoD the capability for total net-centric operations.  As such, this Remedy software has become the de facto standard for trouble ticket management for network operations, enterprise-wide, to track and manage mission critical services, communications network events, outages, restoration and request for network se rvices. NOTE:  This is only a Sources Sought Announcement.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name for Cisco SAN Switches
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure  brand name Cisco SAN MDS9000 switches to support existing Cisco hardware infrastructure that is installed and in production for the USPTO?s automated information systems (AISs). This announcement is considered a brand name justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing USPTO?s existing ID/IQ contracts.  A solicitation will not be released to any other vendors. Specifically, the purchase is to expand the USPTO?s Data Facility West.  These switches will allow storage to remain centralized in the Data Facility East while supporting the Data Facility West. This expansion is necessary to provision storage located in the Data Facility East for the Patent File Wrapper (PFW) environments in the Data Facility West.  Maximum efficiencies for a successful infrastructure spanning multiple data centers are to acquire specific native mode protocols from a single manufacturer.   Cisco networks hardware is the USPTO?s established standard based commercial product for its AISs in accordance with the USPTO?s Technical Reference Model (TRM).   It is essential that the USPTO acquire Cisco switch products to maintain the continuity of the network traffic and business processes and maintain compatibility. In addition, purchase of the same Cisco hardware will reduce and/or share the cost of spares with other network projects, and reduce the maintenance cost by not having to maintain different similar functioning products.  Purchase of different hardware will require additional engineering design and training, component testing, system testing, etc. to ensure reliability and compatibility testing which will delay the mission critical project time and increase the costs beyond the budget limits.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name for Cisco SAN Switches
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name Cisco MDS9000 SAN switches to support existing Cisco hardware infrastructure that is installed and in production for the USPTO?s automated information systems (AISs). This announcement is considered a brand name justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing USPTO?s existing ID/IQ contracts.  A solicitation will not be released to any other vendors. Specifically, the purchase is to expand the USPTO?s Data Facility West.  These switches will allow storage to remain centralized in the Data Facility East while supporting the Data Facility West. This expansion is necessary to provision storage located in the Data Facility East for the Patent File Wrapper (PFW) environments in the Data Facility West.  Maximum efficiencies for a successful infrastructure spanning multiple data centers are to acquire specific native mode protocols from a single manufacturer.   Cisco networks hardware is the USPTO?s established standard based commercial product for its AISs in accordance with the USPTO?s Technical Reference Model (TRM).   It is essential that the USPTO acquire Cisco switch products to maintain the continuity of the network traffic and business processes and maintain compatibility. In addition, purchase of the same Cisco hardware will reduce and/or share the cost of spares with other network projects, and reduce the maintenance cost by not having to maintain different similar functioning products.  Purchase of different hardware will require additional engineering design and training, component testing, system testing, etc. to ensure reliability and compatibility testing which will delay the mission critical project time and increase the costs beyond the budget limits.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Micro Magnetic Systems (MMS) Request for Information
<DESC>Description

Recent work in three-dimensional micro fabrication, such as work performed on DARPA's 3-D Micro Electromagnetic Radio Frequencies Systems (3-D MERFS) program, has demonstrated the ability to create complex 3-D micro-scale structures. Though the 3-D MERFS program was targeted at creating air-core rectangular coaxial transmission line structures, the same fabrication technology can be used to monolithically fabricate complex arrays of high-performance inductors and/or magnetic coils. Similarly, other programs and organizations are developing 3-D micro fabrication technologies that offer the geometric flexibility need to create arrays of inductors and magnetic coils.
This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for suggestions as to how the ability to create micro fabricated coils and magnetic structures could best serve the needs of the Department. Potential applications might include gas or chemical analysis systems, miniaturized microscopy systems, analog RF signal processing systems, acoustic and/or seismic sensors, high voltage or high power control systems, etc. 
DARPA solicits potential performers to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the government in formulating a formal Micro-Magnetic Systems (MMS) solicitation. DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential device that could be fabricated; estimate the anticipated performance of the device in terms of performance, size, weight, power, and reliability relative to existing systems; describe technical challenges that must be overcome to successfully realize said device; and outline the performers approach to overcoming those challenges. 
This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a formal solicitation will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of responder's information.  Should the Government wish to issue a formal solicitation, it is estimated that this would occur approximately during the first quarter of calendar year 2008 for design and demonstration of novel Micro Magnetic Systems (MMS).
Responses should be limited to five pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. RFI responses should be received no later than COB October 15, 2007. 

RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to:

<SUBJECT>F--Invitation for Offer- Federal (Open Market) Crude Helium
<CONTACT>Cynthia S. Martin Contracting Officer 8063561005     Cindy_Martin@nm.blm.gov;
<DESC>Expiration Date:  September 30, 2008 INVITATION FOR OFFER - FEDERAL (OPEN MARKET) CRUDE HELIUM  IFO NO.  BLM-2008-OMCHS-001 October 2007 - September 2008 Introduction The purpose of this IFO is to continue implementation of the terms of the Helium Privatization Act (HPA) of 1996 dealing with the disposal of the Conservation Helium Reserve.  The HPA requires the Department of the Interior (DOI) to offer for sale, beginning no later than 2005, a portion of the Conservation Helium stored underground at the Cliffside Field, north of Amarillo, Texas.  The DOI, in consultation with the private helium industry, has determined that private companies, with refining capacity along the crude helium pipeline, will need a supply of helium in excess of that available from their own storage accounts and that available from crude helium extractors in the region.   Given the current market, Conservation Helium sold in this sale will cause minimal market disruption.   This is the sixth in a series of sales that the Department will conduct to dispose of the Conservation Helium stored underground at the Cliffside Field.  The annual sales  are being conducted in a manner intended to prevent pure helium market disruptions from occurring to end users; shortages of crude helium to pure helium refiners; and an oversupply of crude helium on the market for crude helium extractors.  Subsequent sales may be adjusted as needed. The volume of helium available for this sale is 2,100 MMcf and will be offered in four equal quarterly increments of 525 MMcf.  In accordance with the HPA, this volume was determined by dividing the total volume of stored Conservation Helium less the statutory required reservation of 600 MMcf for Government purposes less estimated In-Kind Crude Helium transfers for 12 years divided by 12.  This volume represents a straight-line basis for offering the helium for sale in accordance with the HPA. The Conservation Helium will be sold at the same price as In-Kind Crude Helium.  In accordance with the HPA, this price covers helium debt repayment and its escalation by the Consumer Price Index since the helium debt was frozen in 1995.  Additionally, the price includes administrative and storage costs associated with the Conservation Helium calculated on a per Mcf basis.  For Fiscal Year 2008 that price is $60.50 per Mcf. Before submitting an offer, you will need to know the definitions of certain terms used in this IFO.  These terms are defined at the end of the IFO. The first request for purchase of helium and other documentation as required in this IFO must be sent by certified mail to:   	 Bureau of Land Management, Amarillo Field Office 	 801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500 	 Amarillo, TX 79101-3545 	 Attention: Crude Helium Sales Analyst You may call Connie H. Neely, (806) 356-1027 with questions about this IFO. Subsequent requests can be emailed to connie_neely@blm.gov. Term  Submit your request for purchase and other documentation, as required, according to the following schedule: "	First Quarter Offering - September 15, 2007 through September 30, 2007 "	Second Quarter Offering - December 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 "	Third Quarter Offering - March 1, 2008 through March 31, 2008 "	Fourth Quarter Offering - June 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008. On the next business day after the request to purchase Conservation Helium for the Quarter is received, it will be opened and evaluated.  Upon evaluation of all offers, volumes of this Conservation Helium Sale will be apportioned and allocated according to the sale rules described in this IFO. Successful requestors will be notified in writing by BLM no later than one week after the end of the request period. Offers You must submit the following information to the BLM, Amarillo Field Office: "	Billing address information and name(s) of principle officers of the company. "	Proof of being an entity qualified to purchase Conservation Helium at this sale as defined in Consideration of Offers.  Documents such as invoices for sale or purchase of helium, Helium Storage Contracts, or other relevant documents may be submitted as proof of qualification. "	The amount (in Mcf) of Conservation Helium requested. "	Check, Credit Card, or money order in the amount of $1,000 made payable to the Bureau of Land Management.  This money will be used to cover administrative expenses to conduct this sale and is nonrefundable. "	The above information only needs to be submitted the first time a prospective purchaser submits a bid. "	Prospective purchasers are not required to submit bids every quarter and may participate in only the quarterly sales they deem appropriate. Consideration of Offers Any person, firm, partnership, joint stock association, corporation, or other domestic or foreign organization operating partially or wholly within the United States who meets one or more of the following requirements is qualified to submit a purchase request: "	Operates a helium purification plant within the U.S., or "	Operates a crude helium extraction plant within the U.S., or "	Is a wholesaler of pure helium or purchases helium for resale within the U.S., or "	Is a consumer of pure helium within the U.S., or "	Has an agreement with a helium refiner to provide its helium processing needs, commonly referred to as a "tolling agreement." All entities requesting participation in the Non-Allocated Sale must submit proof of being qualified to purchase Conservation Helium and must either have a Helium Storage Contract with the BLM or have a third party agreement in place with a valid storage contract holder so that all Conservation Helium sold to the Bidder will be properly covered by a Helium Storage Contract (including associated storage charges). Payment The purchaser is required to pay for the full amount of the quarterly helium purchase according to the following schedule: "	First Quarter request by December 20, 2007 "	Second Quarter request by March 20, 2008 "	Third Quarter request by June 20, 2008 "	Fourth Quarter request by September 20, 2008 Partial payments will be accepted as long as full payment is made according to the above schedule.  After receipt of payment, the BLM will transfer the helium to the purchaser's account on the first day of the month following receipt of payment, unless purchaser requests a delay in the transfer. Make checks payable to the address above. Allocated Sale Those who meet the definition of Crude Helium Refiners are allowed to purchase Conservation Helium in the allocated sale portion of this sale.  An allocated sale is that portion of the annual sale volume of Conservation Helium that is set aside for purchase by the Crude Helium Refiners.   The amount of conservation helium available for the allocated sale will be 94 percent of the total volume of the Annual Conservation Helium Sale - 1,974 MMcf, or 493,500 MCF per quarter. The apportionment of the Conservation Helium will be apportioned to each Crude Helium Refiner based on their percentage share (rounded to the nearest 1/10th of 1 percent) of the total refining capacity as of October 1, 2000 connected to the BLM crude helium pipeline.   If a refiner or refiners request an amount other than their share of what is offered for sale then: "	Any helium not sold during the First, Second, or Third Quarter sales will be carried over to the succeeding Quarter and reallocated. "	If one or more refiners request less than their allocated share, any other refiner(s) that requested more than their share will be allowed to purchase the excess volume based on proportionate shares of remaining refining capacities. "	Requests by the Crude Helium Refiners that are in excess of the amount available above will be carried over to the Non-Allocated Sale and considered a separate bid under the Non-Allocated Sale rules.  Any excess volume not sold to the Crude Helium Refiners will be added to the Non-Allocated Sale volume. For a  hypothetical example of an Allocated Sale, please contact Connie Neely at (806) 356-1027 or through email at connie_neely@blm.gov. Non-Allocated Sale The non-allocated sale is that portion of the annual sale volume of Conservation Helium that will be offered to all qualified Bidders.  The minimum volume that can be requested is 5 MMcf.  The total volume of Conservation Helium available for the non-allocated portion of the quarterly sale is 31,500 Mcf per quarter plus any additional helium that is not sold as part of the Allocated Sale. The ratio of Allocated to Non-Allocated Sale volumes are determined according to the terms of the HPA, the BLM must conduct the Annual Conservation Helium Sales in a manner not to cause undue helium market disruptions; and therefore, the majority of the Conservation Helium is being offered as part of the Allocated Sale.  Currently, the Crude Helium Refiners have refining capacity roughly double what can be supplied through the Annual Conservation Helium Sales.  Although there are other crude helium supplies available to the Crude Helium Refiners, these supplies are declining each year.  The BLM must be sensitive to the Crude Helium Refiners requirements while maintaining a balance with other helium industry requirements.  The exact ratio of Allocated to Non-Allocated Sale volumes may change for subsequent Annual Conservation Helium Sales.  The Conservation Helium will be apportioned equally in 1 Mcf increments among the Bidders with no prospective Bidder receiving more than its request. If a request is made for more than what is made available for sale then: "	If one or more Bidders request less than their apportioned amount, any other Bidder(s) that requested more than its apportioned amount will be allowed to purchase equally apportioned amounts of the remaining volume available for this sale. "	If all Bidders request more than their apportioned amount each Bidder will receive its apportioned. "	Any bidder requesting less than the calculated apportioned volume will receive the amount of their request and amounts remaining will be reapportioned. For a  hypothetical example of a Non-Allocated Sale, please contact Connie Neely at (806) 356-1027 or through email at connie_neely@blm.gov. Liquidated Damages The BLM must receive payment for helium purchased by a company during a quarterly offering before the company is allowed to purchase additional helium under the rules of this IFO.  Additionally, the company will be assessed penalty interest in accordance with the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 951-953 for payments received after the due dates for full payment listed in the "Payment" section.

When the cost of performance of this contract is increased or decreased as a result of the change, the equitable adjustment increasing or decreasing the contract price shall be in accordance with the ?Changes? clause rather than under this clause, but the resulting contract modification shall state that it is made pursuant to this clause.  The contractor is requested to identify specifically any information contained in the engineering change proposal which the contractor considers confidential and/or proprietary and which the contractor prefers not be disclosed to the public.

NOTE:  BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 

Currently, WinRunner/LoadRunner/TestDirector (and add-in's) form the existing baseline of licenses used by TSO Pensacola for functional and regression testing of multiple applications that are constantly evolving and are required to work in diverse environments.  WinRunner fully integrates with LoadRunner for load testing and TestDirector for global test management.  DFAS TSO-Pensacola has invested in Mercury licenses over a period of years.  Upgrades have been provided for WinRunner/LoadRunner/TestDirector licenses covered under maintenance.  These licenses are essential to the on-going enterprise testing effort at TSO-Pensacola and are in synch with the DFAS architecture and infrastructure.

Procuring another alternative product in lieu of renewing the license and maintenance for the current product would result in substantial duplication of costs and it is not likely to be recovered through competition among other products.  

Continuation of maintenance support for WinRunner/LoadRunner/TestDirector licenses previously purchased, implemented and being used by DFAS users is considered to be a logical follow-on.  WinRunner and add-in(s) appear on the DMI Approved Software List.  WinRunner appears on the DFAS Standard Products List for Windows automated testing.

This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 

Encase Enterprise Forensic software provides USSOCOM Headquarters the capability to monitor, investigate, remediate and protect all networks against malicious intrusion, security incidents and cyber attacks.  The software allows USSOCOM to meet the following requirements:
	More rapidly and thoroughly investigate computer incidents occurring on any and all nodes within USSOCOM?s network, regardless of its location (SIPRNet, NIPRNet and JWICS), unique closed networks and standalone systems
	Respond to IDS alerts to verify whether machines have been compromised
	Identify deviations from system baselines during INFOCON support to identify and verify integrity of critical workstations and servers
	Dramatically reduce the time and costs related to investigating and resolving network wide incidents while dramatically increasing the security posture of the information and information systems contained therein
	Ensure policy compliance on all workstations and servers
	Proactively and reactively locate and eliminate classified data spillage that has strayed to a network of lower classification.
	Proactively identify and address internal and external network security, information assurance, and counterintelligence threats before they erupt into significant events.
	Locate, analyze, and capture data in a forensically sound fashion from any network-connected node.
	Identify unauthorized active programs running on the network, such as peer-to-peer communications, covert channels, and alternate data streams.
	Coordinate more effectively with criminal and counterintelligence investigators when investigating an incident.
	Comply more thoroughly and at lower cost with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the resulting NIST interpretation detailed in the Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. 

The acquisition of the maintenance support for the current key licenses will ensure that USSOCOM continues to have the ability to provide operational forensic analysis and remediation at a level of acceptability required by DISA and DoD directives/mandates. The Encase Enterprise software provides a highly specialized capability surpassed by any other application available to resolve, isolate and cleanup contaminated areas dealing with security incidents and events of interest on or within our networks at a level and scope required to support USSOCOMs networks.  Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued performance of a highly specialized service/software

The Encase Enterprise software allows the analyst/technician the ability to access multiple files/folders across an array of servers storing terabytes of data, in a limited amount of time to isolate data needed to be extracted and cleaned to meet NSA, DIA and DISA standards for proper handling of data spills.  No other tool on the market can provide this level of discovery and remediation.  The Encase software that is being used has also been embedded as a module interface in a DoD/Joint Staff downward directed program that will be implemented within USSOCOM this year, which will allow us the ability to further enhance our current capabilities by also protecting workstations and devices on the network.  

United States Special Operations Command believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $466,086.00, as outlined in the table below.  These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees.  

	Qty	Cost	Total
Offsite training	6hrs.	$1,995.00ea.	$11,970.00total;
  Manhours expended	160hrs.	$106.00ea.	$16,960.00total;
  Travel (TDY expenditures)	6hrs.	$1,050.00ea.	$6,300.00total;
Installation 	1hrs.	$15,000.00ea.	$15,000.00total;
  Basic edition - manhours expended	192hrs.	$106.00ea.	$20,352.00total;
  IA Suite - manhours expended	64hrs.	$106.00ea.	$6,784.00total;
Extended Onsite Group Training	120hrs.	$106.00ea.	$12,720.00total;
Initial Cost and 1 year Maintenance	2hrs.	$188,000.00ea.	$376,000.00total;
Total			$466,086.00total;

The cost that would not be recovered through open competition involves resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: 

********EMC Documentum Content Server, (QTY. 6469) Period of Performance, 10/01/07-9/30/08*********

********EMC Documentum Records Management Administrator, (QTY. 200)  Period of Performance, 10/01/07-9/30/08*********

This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 
EMC Documentum Records Manager 5.3 SP4 is a DoD 5015.2 certified software application designed to manage electronic, non-electronic, and e-mail records to include classified records.   EMC Documentum 5.3 Records Manager extends Documentum?s existing Content Management functionality by adding features and functions specific to records management such as corporate file plans, retention policies (RPS), file- and field-level security along with the ability to manage and declare records.  This solution, which is USSOCOM?s chosen DoD compliant Electronic Records Management application, is operated on our internal network and manages HQ USSOCOM and our components official records.  In order to continue to operate this system, we are required to pay a yearly maintenance fee on our current licenses.  Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued production of highly specialized equipment.  

To award to another source would result in substantial cost, delays and ultimately serious mission degradation.  The table below shows costs required to integrate a new system into the current USSOCOM enterprise architecture.  This cost estimate is based on initial licensing, license maintenance, consulting services, training and travel/TDY costs.  The cost does include other factors like additional server licenses, lost manpower hours, data migration costs, end user training, and system down-time to the command.  Additionally, it would directly affect and negatively impact other systems that are currently being fielded at USSOCOM and require this application:


Expenditure	Qty	Cost	Total
RM Administrator Licenses	200	$250.00	$50,000.00

<DESC>This is a combined/synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, F3ZT907190A005,  is issued as a request for quotation.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  (FAC) 2005-05 and Defense DCN 20050913.  The solicitation listed here is 100% small business set aside.  The Federal Supply Class (FSC) 5999.  The associated Standard Classification (SIC) is 3571.  The North American Industry Classification System is 334510 and the size standard is 500 employees.  The government intends to solicit and award this purchase order for the following products:  1 EA Horizon GS Large Format Dry Imager with Accessories and 1 EA Direct Vista Blue Film.  This is a sole brand name requirement, so only the above mentioned products will be accepted. The following is the brand name justification signed by the contracting offier:  
1.Requiring Authority: 60 EMS/MXMG TSgt Daniel G. Dowell
2. Description of Requirement: Horizon GS Large Fonnat Dry Imager
3. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition: FAR 13.106-
1(b) (1). For Federal Supply Schedule Items (GSA, VA): FAR 8.405-6(b).
4. Justification or Authority for action:
A. The Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory currently operates a Virtual Media
Integration Inc. (VMI Inc.) digital x-ray unit. This unit is used to x-ray the heavy-lift
aircraft and their associate components.
B. The NDI Laboratory researched potential suppliers of dry imager printers. After
discussions with VMI Inc., VMI infonned us that the Horizon GS Large fonnat Dry
Imager printer was the only fully capable and fully compatible unit that could fit our
Laboratory's needs for the digital equipment we have on hand.
C. The Horizon GS Large fonnat Dry Imager will be used with the VMI Inc. digital
x-ray machine. The imager prints high quality images of x-rays used in aircraft
and equipment repair.
D. The Horizon machine is the only known brand available that meets the capability
(both hardware AND software) of producing the high quality images of x-rays
that is needed. The Horizon GS unit is the machine that the primary digital x-ray
equipment manufacturer, VMI Inc., uses for its dry imager printers, and both
software and hardware are FULLY COMPATIBLE. In fact, Codonics, the
company that makes the Horizon GS, was sub-contracted by VMI Inc. to produce
a dry imager printer for their digital x-ray equipment.
E. After contacting two other dry imager companies (Kodak and Fuji), neither one
could guarantee software compatibility. Ifwe (the government) buy another dry
imager printer from someone other than Codonics, then there will be no guarantee
that the printer in question will be fully compatible with the hardware/software of
the digital x-ray equipment the NDI Laboratory currently owns and operates.
F. The proposed sole source company, Codonics, is the only known source that
produces the Horizon GS Large fonnat Dry Imager printer which will satisfy the
government's requirement.
G. If this product is not procured, the NDI Laboratory will have no ability to print
high quality x-ray pictures.
Delivery wiil be made to 60 EMS Fabrication Flight, 350 Ragsdale St, Travis AFB, CA 94535.  The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition.

Line item 0002 is not-separately-priced for Lot Testing Data IAW Data Item Description (DID) DI-NDTI-80809B.

The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items with addenda:  a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) and Production Lot Test Plan is required to ensure the material will meet the requirements in MIL-DTL-46077G;  the provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items with addenda:  The Government intends to award Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type contract resulting from this solicitation.  Contract award shall be made to the offeror(s) whose proposal is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements and is determined to represent the best value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the major areas, listed in descending order of importance:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government may split the award of the total quantity to obtain required delivery dates.  Contractors should price the 5,000 lbs, 7,000 lbs, and 8,000 lbs separately and combined. Offerors are not required to bid on the entire 20,000 lbs.  Technical is significantly more important than Past Performance.  Past Performance is significantly more important than Price.  The Technical and Past Performance areas when combined are significantly more important than Price. Failure to comply with the instructions identified herein or mere acknowledgement or restatement of a requirement or task is not acceptable and may be cause for rejection. Each proposal will be evaluated to determine best overall value to the government, price and other factors considered.  The Technical Area will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor will supply a technically compliant, quality product within the required delivery schedule.  The Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor has provided timely, quality products on previous contracts which would indicate their ability to meet their obligations on this requirement.  Competition will determine the reasonableness of price.  The Government will make appropriate trade-offs when required.  In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the government that might result in making only one award, split awards, or no award; particularly the risk to the Government from a delivery, technical integration, logistics, and administrative cost perspective. The Government may award a contract(s) on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror(s) best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  Absent an immediate award, a competitive range determination will be made in accordance with FAR 15.306(c) to limit discussions to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated.  Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offeror. The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts, a single contract, or no contract. In order to be considered for award, offerors must clearly demonstrate the ability to meet at minimum the requirements identified herein and Detailed Specification MIL-DTL-46077G; the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and the offeror must include a completed copy of this provision with their proposal.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region.  The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.  The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.
       
The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program will support the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  The FTI plans to engage the Government of Pakistan's FS and Political Agents as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs.  The FS and its representative Agency structures will constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program.  The FTI effort will require close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including, but not limited to, community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights.  Excellent inter-personal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary.  Experience in contract/grant oversight is required.  Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and management of program operations in a conflict environment is preferred. 

The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.

The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program in FATA.  Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.  Depending on the situation, USG-provided housing in Peshawar may be shared with one other permanent USAID/OTI field staff.  The Country Representative will:

* Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, Government of Pakistan Officials, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;

* Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other relevant agencies and organizations.

* Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, various USG entities, and other donor organizations;

* Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of field-based OTI staff;

* Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

* Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) to ensure that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;

* Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;

* Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS;

* Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

* Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

* Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;

* Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;

* Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government, as appropriate;

* Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the USG personnel in Pakistan, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate. 

* If required, travel to other or potential OTI field locations and/or Washington, DC to provide consultations on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region.  The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.  The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.
       
The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program will support the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  The FTI plans to engage the Government of Pakistan's FS and Political Agents as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs.  The FS and its representative Agency structures will constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program.  The FTI effort will require close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Country Representative - Pakistan.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This is a middle management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition.  The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants.  S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships.  S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Near East Regional Team and will be based in Peshawar, Pakistan.  Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.  Depending on the situation, USG-provided housing in Peshawar may be shared with one other permanent USAID/OTI field staff. 

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;

* Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;

* Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups - many of which have not previously had international funding;

* Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;

* Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;

* Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;

* Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;

* Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop Political Transition Grants;

* Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;

* When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

* When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting country representative in his/her absence, for example;

* Mentor/train other OTI field staff as required; and,

* Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will report to and be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

While in Peshawar, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires extensive travel throughout Pakistan, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The reference solicitation number is NHLBI - PB-HG-2007-260-KLW

This acquisition is in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedure authorized in FAR Part 13, and as a result, a purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisitions Circular 05-19.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 Million.

This requirement is being conducted on a non-competitive sole source basis and is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement as 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The Government?s anticipated delivery date is sixty (60) calendar days after contract award.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, Maryland.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The reference solicitation number is NHLBI - PB-HG-2007-268-KLW

This acquisition is in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedure authorized in FAR Part 13, and as a result, a purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisitions Circular 05-19.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 Million.

This requirement is being conducted on a non-competitive sole source basis and is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement as 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The Government?s anticipated delivery date is sixty (60) calendar days after contract award.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, Maryland.

Market research conducted by the Government has determined that Genetic Analysis Systems are manufactured in sufficient quantities by at least three (3) manufacturers which confirm the commercial market.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), office of Acquisitions (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intend to award a single fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of the SpectraMax M2e Microplate Fluorescence and Absorbance Spectrophotometer.  This spectrophotometer is an automated microplate reader.  Which will be used for microplate assays including ELISA assays, protein level assessments and cell viability assays.  Utilizing the microplate provides the ability to run many assays on one plate which saves time and reagents over a longer period of time. 

Description:

?	Must be a dual monochromator-based system with Top and Bottom reading capacity for dual mode (fluorescence & Absorbance) in 1cm cuvette port and in 6- to 384- well microplate.
?	Must have dual monochromators for turnable fluorescence wavelength selection between 250nm and 850nm for excitation wavelengths and 250nm to 850nm for emission wavelengths.
?	Must have turnable absorbance wavelength selection between 200nm and 1000nm.  No wavelength filters are required for purchase in the future when additional assays are added to laboratory.
?	Must have agitation and temperature control from Ambient +4C up to 45C
?	Must read up to four EX/EM wavelength pairs per microplate for multi-fluorophore assay design.
?	Must have fixed fluorescence spectral bandwidth of 9nm for improved resolution between EX/EM components.  Narrow bandwidth is critical when designing multi-fluorophore assays or when using narrow Stokes shift fluorophores.  
?	Must have a fixed absorbance bandwidth of less or equal to 4nm. 
?	Must have full wavelength scanning capability across the entire spectral range for defining actual EX and EM maxima.  Can perform spectral scan in user-defined increments as small as 1nm, and then can select assay wavelengths for actual maxima.  It does increase sensitivity for assay by working at actual conditions rather than using literature references.
?	Must have automatic PMT setting adjusts the optimum voltage for each well sample concentration and then normalizes the raw data to show RFU values.  Wells are selectively reread at the optimal PMT setting.  Photo-bleaching is eliminated because wells are not illuminated unnecessarily.
?	Must have patented PathCheck sensor.
?	Must offer compliance support tools including: a) software validation package b) IQ/OQ/PQ documentation c) physical validation test plates for absorbance and fluorescence
?	Must ship with software that provides microplate reader data acquisition and analysis support for both Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems.
?	Software must have ability to design custom assay protocols or customize existing protocol to create meaningful reports, graphs, and multi-plate summaries, including trend analysis.  Also be able to save protocol as a menu-available choice so that one touch of the read button will allow completion of data report in final format.
?	Software must allow for the ability to auto save multiple copies of assay data in all desired formats: SoftMax Pro native; .TXT files; .XML files; .PDF files (Mac OS X)
?	Software must allow the following data analysis tools: Evaluation of multiple standard curves simultaneously; ability to easily graph multiple plots on multiple graph sections; 4 and 5 parameter curve fitting with Parallel Line analysis; BOOLEAN operators If, And, Or, Not, False, True
?	Software must support regulatory compliance requirements such as FDA 21CFR part 11, GLP, GMP etc.
?	Software must have control over virtually every aspect of the microplate reader resolution to meet these ?GxP? regulations.

DESCRIPTION: FCI Sandstone, Sandstone MN, operates a rear gate sallyport system consisting of two sliding gates with J operators and interlocks.  Each gate has a vehicular and man gate component.

The control panel at the Control Center is connected by approximately 1500 feet of wiring bundle to the gate systems, which includes a relay cabinet located in the sallyport.  The operating mechanisms of the inner sallyport gate are inoperative.  The clutch, track wear plate, pulley, drive motor, and sensor switches of the vehicular component of the inner gate system have failed.  

SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work is to replace the J operator and gate, including new overhead track and all associated clutch, track wear plate, pulley, chain, and motor mechanisms, for the inner gate.  The existing gate panel, track, and gate posts may be re-used.  Existing power circuits in the sallyport area will need to be extended to the new operator and Control Center as needed.  New relays will be installed as necessary at either the sallyport relay cabinet and/or control center panel.  Motor mechanisms will include overload protection and provision for manual operation of the gate system.  Gearbox systems will include heaters to ensure continuing lubrication capability of lubricants contained within.  Motor gearbox will be locked with a prison lock.  Detention quality hardware and tamperproof screws will be used in securing access panels, covers, hatches, and other points of entrance to the overall system.  The existing gate panel is approximately 14ft. x 14ft.

Statement of Work (SOW):
Purpose ? 

NIST currently is utilizing software that was written in-house using the LabView programming language.  The current software adjusts electrical current in NIST?s test apparatus using a feedback signal from a positioning sensor.  The software reads the measured value of the electrical current from a multimeter, room temperature, and room humidity and displays the values onto an LCD monitor.  The purpose of this statement of work is to modify and add to this existing software to:

1)	Acquire data from an Agilent model 1826 D/E/F Laser Interferometer Positioning System and associated Agilent multimeters such as the Agilent 3458 that works with a personal computer to accurately position a mass artifact.  
2)	Control hardware and electronic controllers to perform special functions such as setting feedback parameters to the computer interface boards that control the interferometer system, and physically move the apparatus to the user?s desired distance.  
3)	Control electro-mechanical hardware and electronic equipment to perform mass comparisons with a Mettler-Toledo, model AX1005 commercially available mass balance using a NIST designed moveable portable vacuum chamber that will allow transfer of masses from an experiment that is under vacuum to the AX1005 balance without venting to atmospheric pressure.

The web site for this is:     http://www.ccr.gov/      There are two evaluation factors     (1) Hourly Rate, and  (2) Experience.     Experience is more important than price.      (1)     Price requires submittal of a fully loaded hourly rate.      (2)     Experience requires discussion of your:      *     Formal education.      *     Time employed in related tasks.      *     Web site addresses (URLS) of web sites you have worked on, and your role in their development.      *     References with phone numbers and e-mail  addresses.      Submit your discussion of the above Experience factors within the body of your e-mail message to the Contracting Officer, COL Patti Woods at patti.woods@us.army.mil not later than September 24, 2007 1100 CST.  Information provided will be treated as confid ential material and released only on a need-to-know basis.     After award, your hourly rate may become public information.      Confidentiality of Past Performance Information:     The Government may use past performance information obtained from other sources.     The Government reserves the right to maintain the confidentiality of the past performance information provided by the references listed by the offeror, as well as references obtained by other means.     By submitting a proposal for consideration under this solicitation, the offeror agrees that it shall not seek to discover from any source the contents of such communicatio ns.     The offeror releases the Government from any obligation to divulge the source of any information relied upon in its evaluation.      Award of Contract:     Award will be made to the offeror, (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government.     Cost or price is more important than any individual technical f actor.     However, evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are cumulatively more important than cost or price in the award decision.     The critical factor in making any cost / technical trade-off is not the spread between technical s cores, but rather, the significance of that difference.     The significance of the spread in scores will be determined on the basis of what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it.     Award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilit ies that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work.     The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and advantageous to the Government.      Awards may be made without further negotiations.     Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.     However, the Government may, after evaluati on of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate, with all offerors whose proposals are within a competitive range.

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide the Attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an OTI Deputy Country Representative - Pakistan, in Peshawar, Pakistan

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide the Attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE NUMBER NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-206P-DCH.

The combined synopsis / solicitation is herein amended to:
1.	Cancelled the pre-proposal site visit scheduled to be held the week of September 17, 2007, at the delivery and installation location.   

	Due to unforeseen circumstances the installation site has yet to be determined.  Therefore, a pre-proposal site visit is no longer required.

2.	The proposal receipt date is extended to October 15, 2007, 5:00 p.m. at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,  Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902.   Attention Debra C. Hawkins, Contracting Officer, (301) 435-0367.  Proposals may be submitted electronically to hawkinsd@nhlbi.nih.gov or by FAX to (301) 480-3345.   The electronic transmission and fax transmission must reference the solicitation number: NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-206P-DCH.

The Offeror is expected to submit its proposal for the Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner equipment.   The costs associated with the turnkey installation and room renovations will be determined after contract award.   


This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-206P-DCH

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).

This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Item procedures and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-19.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  

Market research conducted by the Government through FedBizOpps has determined that there are no reasonable expectations of obtaining two or more small business offers.  Therefore, the acquisition is being conducted on a competitive unrestricted basis, with no set aside restrictions.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees. 
 
The Government?s anticipated delivery date is not later than February 2008.   

The delivery point is at a location to be determined at The National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland campus.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), intend to award a single, fixed priced contract for the purchase of the Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner.

Background Information - The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures.  This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery.  The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions.  

Computed Tomography is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body.  The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods.  The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients.  This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium.  One disadvantage of current generation MDCT scanners is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors.  Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body.  To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts.  This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.

Objectives - This contract requires delivery of a detector CT scanner and installation that meet the requirements below, which will also require room renovations, in the NIH Heart Center at Suburban Hospital.  This equipment purchase will support pre-clinical and clinical research using high resolution CT scans to study myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability, coronary calcium, coronary artery stenosis, catheter-based interventions, and robotic surgery.

Services to be Performed.  General Requirements - Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services and perform the work set forth below.

All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, whose position is defined elsewhere in this contract.

Specific Requirements - The contractor shall be responsible for delivering, installing, providing maintenance and training for a MDCT scanner.

Mandatory Specifications - The instrument must be a detector capable of acquiring 256 rows of data simultaneously for reconstruction into 3-dimensional CT images of the body whereby 11cm of the body can be imaged in half of a rotation around the body.  The range shall be large enough to cover many organs such as the brain and the heart within a half rotation of the scanner.  

Gantry rotation time is specified to be at least: 400ms indicating that cardiac images can be obtained with half rotation times of approximately 200ms.

MDCT Scanner Specifications - The system will include all hardware and software necessary to acquire and reconstruct images for a wide range of applications including but not limited to coronary calcium, contrast enhanced CT coronary angiography , angiography of other blood vessels, chest, brain, body, and other general CT applications.

<DESC>Combined synopsis/solicitation, for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6

The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  North American Industry Classification System Code 541511 and Size Standard not to exceed $23M.  A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated.  The anticipated award date is two weeks after response/closing date.  

Requirement: 

CLIN 0001 1 each Polyanalyst analytical support software V 6.0 or equivalent 

The government is seeking a software suite to support research, indexing, text mining, and data extraction from commercial databases and internet searches.  Commercially available products such as Megaputer's Polyanalyst, or a combination of software tools that provide similar capability are sought.  The government requires 6 copies for installation to networked workstations and 2 copies for installation on laptop computers which will be used in a stand-alone capacity.  Any software licensing should be tied either to the organization or to the individual machine.  The government will require training for 10 people with the initial delivery.  Maintenance and recurring training and support costs should be proposed as an option.  

Evaluation Criteria: 

The evaluation criteria for this requirement is Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  

To be technically acceptable the successful offeror must propose a software application or combination of applications which will meet all the attached technical capabilities.

Delivery: 

FOB destination and delivered to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico

Delivery is 2 weeks after receipt of order.

Submission Instructions: 

Responses must be emailed to both of the following email addresses: david.baum@disa.mil and Nag.Contracting@kirtland.af.mil. Responses must be received no later than 11:00 AM local time (Arlington, VA) on 17 Sep. 2007. 

Additional Questions/Answers: 

Question 6. For the first six copies of PolyAnalyst, is the government seeking the server/client configuration with six PolyAnalyst clients connected to a single server? Or six standalone seats of PolyAnalyst are required? 

Answer 6: A client/server configuration would work, but would require two servers: one for the acquisition side of the network and the other for the analysis side (these networks are physically separated).

Question 7. Should we include an estimate for standard travel expenses in our proposal? Or will travel expenses be reimbursed separately?

Answer 7: The training cost a vendor proposes should include all costs associated with presenting the training, including materials, travel, per diem, and lodging

Question 8. Will the government have available an IT system administrator who can install and configure the PolyAnalyst Server? Could we remotely support this administrator with the installation and configuration of PolyAnalyst? Or should we plan to carry out the system installation and configuration ourselves at the customer location?

Answer 8: We have an IT shop.  If the installation is such that a typically trained system administrator can conduct the installation with remote assistance, then that would work.  If it is more complex, then the offeror should plan an on-site install and propose travel and labor accordingly.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to modify a combined synopsis solicitation posted to FedBizOps September 5, 2007. Please note that the response date of September 17, 2007 at 11:59 PM remains unchanged QUESTION:  Assembly of drawing AL56008 to AL56007  the tolerances on both parts would indicate that this is not a press or interference fit.  Tolerances are wide enough that the parts would essentially be loose.  Is the intention that these parts should b e manufactured within tolerances so that they are assembled as a press fit or is it possible to assemble using a loctite binder? ANSWER:  The clearances between the explosive billet and body (0.00196 inches) as well as the body and base plate (0.00098 inches), are small enough that glue or sealant is not required.  The desired fit for these parts is a tight, sliding fit.  Heating or  cooling of parts to aid in assembly is permissible and at the discretion of the offeror. The fit between the PIC and the base plate is a sliding fit.  The desired fit would allow the PIC to be disassembled and stored separately from the remainder of the warhead.

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME FOR QUOTATIONS REMAINS UNCHANGED.            QUESTION 1.  Question 17 revisited: ASME N510, Section 6, Duct and Housing Leak and Structural Capability Te sts provide the procedure for performing the duct/housing leak tests, not the acceptance criteria.  ASME N509, Section 4.14.2 states that The system designer (Engineer) shall determine leakage criteria and allowable leakage to meet governing Codes, Standar ds, regulations, and plant-specific requirements.  ASME AG-1, Article HA-4531 and SA-4531 state that the Owner or designee shall establish the allowable leakage to ensure ventilation, temperature, and contamination control functions are achieved.  Please e stablish the allowable pressure boundary leak rate so we know we are providing what is required.             ANSWER:   0.0005 CFM/cubic feet volume  The maximum leakage rate in CFM = (0.002 x V) / 60 minutes. The rate is measured by pressurizing the housin g to 10 inches water gage and then monitoring the pressure and temperature after 5 minutes or more.                 QUESTION 2. With regard to the aspect ratio question:  2.1 Since the FIF is now rated for 2000 CFM, the 5000 CFM system will require six FIF 's (three in parallel x two in series.  We need confirmation that APG wants the FIF's stacked one on top of the other so that the overall dimensions for one FIF section is 50 inches wide by 76 inches high by 24 inches deep.                ANSWER:  The Gove rnment is providing 8 FIF housings for the 5000 CFM system.  Please integrate the 8 housings Four in parallel and Four in series.  Allowed to stack two high two wide which requires access from both sides for filter change out.  2.2 Since the FIF is now rat ed for 2000 CFM, the 3000 CFM system will require four FIF's (two in parallel x two in series).  We need confirmation that APG wants the FIF's stacked one on top of the other so that the overall dimensions for one FIF section is 50 inches wide by 48 inches  high by 24 inches deep.            ANSWER:  The Government is providing 6 FIF housings for the 3000 CFM system.  Please integrate the 6 FIF housings three in parallel and three in series.  Allowed to stack three high with access from one side. The two FIF  systems are for a special chamber where excess gas absorption capacity is desired.
