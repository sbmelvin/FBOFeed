<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to purchase native shrub seedlings (spiny hopsage, antelope bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, wyoming big sage, snow buckwheat and tansy aster) for the Handford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife refuge which lies in the Columbia Basin Ecoregion of Eastern Washington State.  This ecoregion is in the "rain shadow" of the Cascade Mountains and is the hottest and driest part of the State.  Rainfall values for the area average 6" annually.  Temperatures often exceed 90o F during the summer, while winter temperatures hover near freezing.  Windy, drying conditions are normal for the region.  Soils are alluvial deposits from ice age lakes, and river channels.  Soils tend to be sandy, with little organic material, and do not generally retain significant moisture.   Due to these conditions, plant materials adapted to the site conditions are essential for restoration purposes.  Plant materials derived from the local ecoregion will have a competitive advantage during establishment and have a higher probability of survival once established, than material that is not from the local ecoregion.
Plant Materials:
o	Seed source for growing plant material should be Hanford or Columbia Basin Ecoregion derived.  The Columbia Basin Ecoregion is defined as that area of land and associated plant communities that lie in and around the Columbia River basin of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  Seeds that produced plant materials must have their origin in this area.
o	Shrubs may be grown as bareroot stock in nursery beds, or as container stock in 4", 6", or 10" tublings.	o	Plants must be a minimum age of 5 months old.	o	Bare root stock should be a minimum of 15 cm height, with a minimum root length of 15 cm	o	Container stock roots should completely fill the containers	o	Plants should be cold hardened for dormancy prior to delivery.		Pricing shall be FOB destination to Northern Benton County, Washington, at the U.S.F.W.S. facility on Midway Road at the BPA substation, just south and west of the Vernita Bridge.  The approximate expected Delivery date is between 17 November and 15 December, 2008.  Return of any containers/shipping cartons must be specified in bid. 
Basis for award will be low price.  Solicitation number: 101818Q502 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov".

BACKGROUND.  One of the primary missions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as managers of the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge (HRNM/SMNWR) is to protect, manage and restore the native habitats and biodiversity of the Columbia Basin shrub-steppe ecosystem.  To accomplish this mission, it is essential to attempt to replace an over story of native shrubs in areas where shrubs have been eliminated.  Sagebrush, Rabbitbrush, Bitterbrush and other native shrubs are a critical part of habitat for various wildlife species that use the Monument.  Upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration has been identified for areas previously impacted by repeated wildland fires.  Specifically, impacts to shrub-steppe habitat related to the "Overlook" fire of July 2007 will be addressed through this scope of work.  The "Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation Plan (BAER)" for the Overlook Fire provide for the planting of native shrubs (e.g. sagebrush) for rehabilitation.  The BAER plan indicates that the purpose of these activities are to protect and restore the ecological integrity and site productivity of shrub-steppe plant communities on the Monument in accordance with established management plan guidelines.  In addition, restoration activities comply with directives established in USFWS - BAER policy for the protection of ecosystem health, threatened and endangered species, and Native American cultural values.  
	OBJECTIVES.  To plant approximately 640,000 native shrub (e.g. sagebrush) seedlings within specific upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration sites on the Hanford Reach National Monument.
	REQUIREMENTS.  The Contractor shall provide all labor and equipment to perform the restoration planting as described below. 
	PRODUCT: Provide planting of 640,000 native shrubs on upland areas of the Monument, as identified by the staff of the HRNM/SMNWR.
	ITEMS FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT:  The U.S. Government will provide: Plant materials, maps of the areas to be planted, marking (flagging) of areas to be planted, plant storage, plant transport, oversight of planting activity and coordination with other management activities at the HRNM/SMNWR.  
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS for Native Shrub Restoration Planting 2008, Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge
1.  Sagebrush Planting.
1.1  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Provide all labor, tools, equipment and materials to perform all work in strict accordance with the specifications, plans and timing identified in this document.
2.  AREA DESCRIPTION:  Specific upland sites of the Hanford Reach National Monument, in Grant and Franklin County, Washington.  Staff of the HRNM/SMNWR will identify (flag) specific areas on the ground within these areas.  Approximately 600 to 1400 acres will be planted, in up to 7-10 discrete locations.
3.   PLANT MATERIAL;  Plant material will be supplied by the Government.  Plants will meet technical specifications for plant materials, generally plants a minimum of 5 months old, with roots minimum of 15 cm and maximum of 40 cm, and shrub height minimum of 10 cm.
4.  PRINCIPLE ITEMS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED:  Plant approximately 640,000 native shrubs (e.g sagebrush) seedlings, within specific upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration sites on the HRNM/SMNWR. The following sub-paragraphs identify specific sub-tasks to fulfill the requirements of this project.
4.1  Upon receipt of the notice to proceed, The Contractor shall plant the shrubs by hand using planting shovels to properly place, space, and compact around each shrub as specified.  Notice to proceed shall be based upon sufficient soil moisture, and will be determined by HRNM/SMNWR personnel.  Ultimately, the planting shall be accomplished in such manner as to provide the shrubs the best opportunity for survival (i.e. full soil to root contact, proper planting hole depth and orientation to prevent "J-rooting", proper plant spacing, etc.).  Holes will be large enough and deep enough to insert plant roots without bending or crushing root fibers.  All plant roots will be inserted vertically into the hole, with roots straight to avoid "J" rooting of seedling plants (roots bent at the tip due to shallow hole). Plant roots will be completely surrounded by soil so that no roots are exposed to air. Soil around plant roots will be loose enough so that roots will thrive and grow, yet compacted enough so that there is no air contact to roots.   Attempts will be made to keep any unnecessary soil disturbance to a minimum. Plant materials will consist of approximately 600,000 bare root stock shrubs and approximately 40,000 containerized shrub seedlings.  Shrubs shall remain in cold storage until the day they are planted to maintain dormancy.  Any extra plants not planted will be stored in cool, dry location each day.  
4.2  Spacing and planting patterns.  The Contractor shall plant the shrubs in several patterns as determined and directed by the staff of the HRNM/SMNWR.  Spacing of the plants shall be on 10-30' foot centers (depending on pattern specified by HRNM/SMNWR staff) and planted in rows, triads, islands, or patches.   Staff from HRNM/SMNWR will identify specific sites and planting patterns to be used.  Field crew will be instructed on the location, plant spacing, direction of travel, and distance for each plot planted, prior to planting.  The goal of this effort is to re-establish a mosaic of shrub colonies that can provide natural regeneration of larger areas, and to provide specific habitat requirements within these areas. 
4.3  Other work as necessary to accomplish the above items.
5.  INTERFACE WITH OTHERS:  Government use of the facilities in this project area is anticipated while the work of this contract is being performed.  The work shall be planned and accomplished so that there will be a minimum of interference and inconvenience to other operations taking place on the HRNM/SMNWR.  The Contractor shall coordinate with staff of the HRNM/SMNWR to determine what other operations are scheduled to occur in areas effected by this project and to plan planting efforts in coordination with other management activities on Monument lands.
6.  TECHNICAL ITEMS:  
6.1  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION:  All operations performed by The Contractor shall be conducted in compliance with all pertinent federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any and all waste products generated while fulfilling this contract (except as specified by HRNM/SMNWR staff).  All packing materials shall be recycled at local area recycling station when possible.  All other wastes shall be disposed of by The Contractor at off site location.  Contractor shall utilize existing roads to access planting areas, and shall utilize existing staging areas in the field.	6.2  PROJECT AREA: Wahluke Unit, Hanford Reach National Monument, Grant and Franklin Counties, Washington.
6.3  QUALIFICATIONS:  Personnel involved with the execution of this contract shall be experienced and qualified in the type of work required.  Contractor shall provide a written work plan summary, with contract bid, including how they will accomplish the project.  Work plan should be concise.
7.  TIMING:
7.1  Timing of this shrub planting project shall be between 10 November 2008 and 28 February 2009. Planting dates will be determined by staff of HRNM/SMNWR.  Soil moisture must be greater than 10% prior to planting.  There must be some precipitation before and some predicted following the planting dates.  Upon issue of notice to proceed, the Contractor shall have 2 days to mobilize and begin planting of the shrubs. The Contractor shall complete planting within 20 calendar days after given the notice to proceed.  This narrow window of performance is required to take advantage of optimum soil moisture opportunities and to ensure that shrubs retain their integrity.   This performance window is subject to potential weather conditions that may prevent planting (i.e. frozen ground).  The performance window may be modified based on weather conditions in coordination with, and with approval of, Monument staff.
7.2  It is anticipated that the Contractor will have to plant approximately 32,000 shrubs per day in order to meet the timeline proposed.  Contractor would be well advised to consider the appropriate labor requirements to meet the 20-day performance window.  Additionally, daylight hours during November and December are limited (sunrise at approximately 07:30 am and sunset at approximately 16:15).
