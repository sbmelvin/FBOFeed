<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide a Fair Lending Review of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSE) Underwriting Systems. The Period of Performance is a base period plus 4 one year option periods. Performance of the work shall be done onsite, located at HUD Headquarter, Washington DC
<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for reviewing and commenting on the underwriting and appraisal guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two major government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the conventional secondary mortgage market, to determine their compliance with federal fair lending laws.HUD conducts regulatory reviews that examine the fair lending implications of all aspects of these guidelines, with particular focus on the automated mortgage scoring systems that have been implemented by the GSEs and made available by GSEs to lenders for use in mortgage underwriting.<br /><br />HUD's regulatory review includes detailed examination of the structure of the mortgage scoring models used within the GSEs' automated underwriting systems, the process through which the models were developed, and the GSEs' use of the models. Automated underwriting systems make a quantitative evaluation of creditworthiness based on borrower credit history; information about the mortgage loan and property; and the borrower's financial status. The review includes examination of the GSEs' own analyses of the systems for possible discriminatory effects, and examination of the impacts of the models based on data collected over the past few years. It includes components that will better define appropriate fair lending performance criteria for secondary market enterprises and develop appropriate methodology for assessing performance. Finally, it will identify an appropriate program of HUD long-term monitoring to address key issues, such as risk-based pricing.</p>
<p>Support HUD staff in its regulatory review of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's automated underwriting systems. Participate with HUD staff in examining information from the GSEs on the structure of their automated underwriting systems, their development of the systems, their application of the systems in the mortgage loan purchase process, the possible discriminatory effects of the systems, and their business purposes. Assignments range from developing statistical models for fair lending compliance analysis to assisting HUD in reviewing files and documents gathered during the review process.</p>
<p>HUD will assist in determining the GSEs' compliance with federal fair lending laws. HUD will provide guidance on the legal standards for establishing liability under these laws. Develop a comprehensive and detailed methodology for analyzing the information and data received from the GSEs to determine whether these legal standards have been met. The approach should be well-grounded in the existing economics literature on lending discrimination and may involve examining the practices used by regulatory agencies and the GSE to measure fair lending compliance.</p>
<p>The type of work to be performed may include:<br /><br />Development of research methodologies at the conceptual and applied levels;<br />Developing and testing economic models;<br />Cleaning and/or entering data provided by HUD;<br />Statistical analyses of data ranging in sophistication from simple cross-tabulations to multivariate techniques;<br />Evaluation and synthesis of analytical results at both the technical and policy relevant levels;<br />Providing literature reviews to HUD on relevant fields.<br />Providing industry know-how and industry expertise in assisting HUD in the review.<br /><br />Review of GSE Analyses <br /><br />HUD staff will jointly review GSE descriptive information and supporting analyses in order to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the GSEs mortgage scoring systems, recent changes in these systems, and any implications for regulatory issues or the in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Some key elements of the review of descriptive materials and supporting analyses include:</p>
<p>What data bases were used to develop the scorecard and the coverage, geographic and otherwise, of those data bases;</p>
<p>The process by which the GSEs selected variables for possible inclusion in the scorecard; whether the data on which the mortgage scorecard was developed represent the likely mortgage applicants, the extent to which minorities were represented in the data; and identifying variables that may raise fair lending issues such as geographic variables or other variables highly correlated with protected classes.</p>
<p>What analyses the GSEs conducted of the impacts of the mortgage scorecard and its components on minority groups and the findings of those analyses; and</p>
<p>The process for selecting cutoff points for the different risk classifications (e.g., "accept," "refer with caution").</p>
<p>The extent to which the scorecard serves the GSEs' business purposes such as by predicting default risk, and the GSEs' documentation of its effectiveness.<br /><br />Analysis of Loan-Level Quantitative data<br /><br />While this list is not comprehensive, it illustrates the issues and questions that HUD seeks to address with the loan level data provided by the GSEs. <br /><br />a)Mortgage scorecard development analysis. Such an analysis could cover several basic questions about the operational impact of the scorecard. Some examples include:<br /><br />What is the distribution of mortgage scores and risk classifications by borrower and neighborhood characteristics (race, income, neighborhood)</p>
<p>What is the distribution of loan and underwriting characteristics by race? This descriptive information will be very helpful in any analysis of disparate impact.</p>
<p>What are the most important component variables (i.e., credit history scores or mortgage application variables such as LTV) in the mortgage scorecard? Do the credit history variables have different impacts than the traditional mortgage application variables? How do the credit history data vary by race and other borrower characteristics?</p>
<p>Essentially, this descriptive analysis could cover issues such as those in the Federal Reserve studies of credit scoring.</p>
<p>b) Testing for alternative model specification that could be used for scorecard. This is to examine whether some alternative model specifications, such as adding different variables or interactions could succeed in reducing adverse impacts on minorities yet maintain the overall productiveness of the scorecards.<br /><br />c) Testing for alternative cutoff levels that could be used for scorecard decisions. This is to examine whether some alternative cutoff levels used in scorecard decisions could succeed in reducing adverse impacts on minorities yet still serve the legitimate business requirements of the GSEs.<br /><br />d) Overrides. Do overrides (ad hoc adjustments to the model) to the model result in improper discrimination? Do they serve a business purpose?<br /><br />e) Manual Underwriting. Perform a direct analysis of loan-level data on those loans that are purchased by the GSEs without use of automated underwriting systems to determine operational impacts of manual underwriting in terms of loan and borrower characteristics for purchased loans.</p>
<p>f) Examine variations in interest rates and guarantee fees. The data should reveal the degree that guarantee fees vary, and if they do, how they vary across borrower and neighborhood characteristics.</p>
<p>g) Examine the agencies' lending for multi-family properties. This includes, among other tasks, identifying differences from the underwriting standards for single family properties, identifying fair lending issues raised by multi-family lending standards, and testing for improper discrimination.</p>
<p>h) Examine the GSEs' purchase of loans secured by properties on Native American land.</p>
<p>i) Business Purposes. Key issues include how well the scorecard predicts mortgage defaults, and whether the scorecard is equally predictive across races.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE FHA ANALYSES</p>
<p>At HUD's discretion, this contract may be extended to cover a fair lending review of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Support HUD staff in its regulatory review of the FHA's automated underwriting system (the "TOTAL scorecard"), its manual underwriting processes, and other aspects of its mortgage underwriting. HUD anticipates that any FHA review will mainly consist of smaller, discrete tasks such tasks as fair lending analyses of FHA Mortgagee Letters which announce changes in FHA lending standards and policies.</p>
<p>Work products include project management and planning documents such as a Management and Work Plan, Monthly Management Reports, and a Research Design and Analysis Plan; written presentations of research findings and recommendations in the form of memos, draft reports, interim reports, and final reports; statistical tables and figures; computer code, data sets, and documentation; and briefings and presentations to HUD, GSEs, and other stakeholders</p>
<p>Qualifications may include a doctorate in economics or a related field; knowledge of advanced economic and statistical methods; a record of producing high-quality research and technical reports; and extensive knowledge of the mortgage industry, as demonstrated by business, regulatory, or research experience.</p>

<CONTACT>Jesus Lugo JR, 9042321051

<a href="mailto:jesse.lugo@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Jacksonville</a>
<DESC>SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT  <br>  <br> 1.  Introduction  <br>  <br> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District intends to award a sole source contract to Desert Research Institute, of the Nevada System of Higher Education, Reno NV  <br>  <br> 2.  Description of Services <br> The overall objective of the Modified Waters Delivery Project is to improve the timing and volume of water deliveries from existing conveyance structures to the Everglades National Park.  This requires operation of pump stations to transport water to the Everglades National Park, but also to maintain flood protection to adjacent developed areas.  A two-year operational test of the S-356 pump station on L-29 Canal will be conducted to evaluate surface water conveyance and seepage management along L-29 and adjacent areas in the Everglades National Park.  Hydrogeologic conditions prior to and during the operational test will be monitored at existing instrumented wellfields located north (along the L-30 canal and Water Conservation Area-3B) and south (along the L-31N canal and Everglades National Park) of the pump station.  Monitoring wells are equipped with sensors to measure groundwater level, flow velocity and direction, and temperature.  Sensors that measure groundwater flow velocity and direction were developed and constructed for this project application, and are not available as commercial off the shelf (COTS) technology.  Groundwater sensors in two wells will be upgraded to accommodate newer components of the data acquisition system.  Sensors transmit data via existing telemetry to an internet-based portal for real-time evaluation of raw data.  Subsequently, raw data are evaluated using a quality control process approved previously by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The components of this Groundwater Monitoring Study are integrated, consisting of sensors for measurement, transmission, real-time presentation, and quality control evaluation.  Based on this information, the Geotechnical Branch is requesting this Groundwater Monitoring Project to be conducted from 2015 to 2017.  This work will be contracted as a one-year base with one-year option. <br>  <br> The NAICS code is 541620 <br>  <br> 3.  Authority  <br>  <br> DFARS 206.302-1, Only One Responsible Source <br>  <br> 4.  Reason for Sole Source   <br> (a) Background: Groundwater level and flow data have been measured at the L-30 and L-31N instrumented wellfields since September 2010, in support of several different U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Projects.  Between September 2010 and November 2011, data were acquired by the main contractor, Cardno-ENTRIX with web portal and data quality control activities subcontracted to the Desert Research Institute.  Between October 2012 and August 2014, project lead activities were contracted to the Desert Research Institute with field sampling and field operations and maintenance activities subcontracted to Cardno-ENTRIX.  It was anticipated that the operational test of the S-356 pump station would occur during the 2012-2014 period, but the test was delayed due to unresolved legal issues.  Those issues are now resolved, so the 2015-2017 Groundwater Monitoring Project will acquire data that can be compared to baseline conditions defined during the 2010 to 2014 projects.  It is important that the proposed monitoring effort be conducted by the same field team in the same manner, using the same personnel, equipment, methods of data acquisition, and data quality control processes.  This approach will reduce the risk of variability in results, and is more cost-effective than initiating this project with a new, untested team.  Previous contracts are Contract W912EP-06-D-0015, task order 0006 awarded to Cardno ENTRIX on 26 September 2009 as a task order on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to Cardno ENTRIX.  Contract W912HZ-12-C-0048 was awarded to the Desert Research Institute on 27 September 2012 in response to Broad Area Announcement BAA 12-5022. <br> (b) Justification: The Desert Research Institute (DRI), the non-profit research campus of the Nevada System of Higher Education, is a world leader in environmental sciences through the application of knowledge and technology.   DRI is the only organization that is qualified to lead the maintenance and data acquisition of the groundwater velocity measurement systems in place at this study area. These measurement systems are not COTS instruments but were designed and built by scientists who are DRI employees specifically for measuring aquifer hydrodynamics. DRI personnel have developed the procedures and written software code to calculate groundwater velocity and direction from this system. The familiarity of the DRI scientists with the instrumentation combined with ready access to the data stream in real time enables them to diagnose malfunctions, calibrate sensors, assess data quality, and implement corrective actions by field staff. Other potential sources in the environmental monitoring industry do not have the system or operational knowledge of the instruments as this knowledge is proprietary information.  DRI personnel have also developed the Acuity System that integrates data telemetry, storage, quality control, and visualization into a single service. This integrated service streamlines the ability of project personnel to manage data, including providing easy to use tools to perform regular data quality adjustments and web-based access to all real-time data by project personnel with more limited access by the public. <br>   <br> 5. No solicitation package will be issued. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 PM Eastern Time on June 8, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to jesse.lugo@usace.army.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.  <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. <br>

<p><em>*</em>Small requirement for the first year of the BPA, but historically required an additional 660 mice per year<br />**No current requirement but previously used<br /><br /><em>Delivery Location:</em><br />AFRRI Loading Dock<br />Include PO Number on Packing Slip<br />8901 Wisconsin Avenue<br />Building 42<br />Bethesda, MD 20889-5603</p>
<p>The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed priced (FFP) BPAs to the offeror(s) representing the best value, using tradeoffs, to the government based on the evaluation factors listed below.  The Government reserves the right to add BPA holders at any time during the life of the agreement. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first.  The government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors.  The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Factors (Listed in order of importance):<br /></span></strong><br /><strong>1.	Corporate Experience: </strong>Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in supplying mice and rats for research purposes.  Experience in providing the specific strains include in the estimated requirements spreadsheet may be considered more desirable by the Government.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 3 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>2.	Technical Experience:</strong> Offerors must submit literature for the quoted animals and provide a description of the housing for the animal and the transportation method. At a minimum, the literature must demonstrate that the animals quoted meet the minimum specifications. Offerors must also provide literature on their breeding program and how they maintain adequate levels of stock for the mice and rat strains identified. Offerors must also provide delivery lead time after receipt of order.  As part of evaluating corporate experience, USU reserves the right to visit the offerors' facilities prior to award.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 7 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>3.	Past Performance: </strong> The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years.  Offerors must provide two (2) customer references for similar work performed.   The Government reserves the right to select which reference(s) to contact.  The following must be provided for each listed reference:<br />&bull;	Name of client and address<br />&bull;	Name of current point of contact including telephone number , email address and title<br />&bull;	Contract number<br />&bull;	Contract value<br />&bull;	Contract period of performance<br />&bull;	A clear description of the supplies/services provided</p>
<p>USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a Neutral/Unknown rating for past performance.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references.  Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 2 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>4.	Price:  Offerors are required to complete the highlighted cells in the pricing Excel spreadsheet provided as Attachment 1.</strong> Prices will be evaluated by calculating the total cost of all five years of pricing provided in the spreadsheet.  For evaluation purposes, the cost of shipping will be evaluated using 10 deliveries per year.    Offerors must provide a fixed price unit cost and total cost for the full duration of the BPA.   Offerors are requested to include prices for other available strains of mice and rats that can be incorporated in the BPA.  Offerors must include all applicable costs (Example: Animals, Containers, Shipping) in their quote.  Prices can be reevaluated annually on the anniversary of the date of award and can be adjusted to a mutually agreeable price.  If the presented price is determined not to be fair and reasonable, the Government reserves the right to not utilize the BPA.</p>
<p>The quantities listed are estimates only and are based on the traditional five percent increase in rodent purchases.</p>
<p>See attached list for applicable provisions and clauses for this requirement.</p>
