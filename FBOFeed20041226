6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			USAID/Armenia/DSRO 	  				
8: POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.        Background
 
Due to the immediate and dramatic needs of Armenia following its declaration of independence in 1991, USAID’s interventions in the social and health sectors focused initially on the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance.  Throughout the Mission’s 1999-2003 strategy, USAID/Armenia refocused its humanitarian assistance programs towards longer-term development efforts in the social and health areas.
Under the new country strategy (FY2004-2008), USAID/Armenia’s Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) oversees work of three Strategic Objectives (SOs):  democracy/governance (SO 2.1), health (SO 3.2), and social protection (SO 3.4).  The “improved social protection” strategic objective will be achieved through three intermediate results (IRs):  improved social assistance services for targeted populations, reduced need for government subsidies, and established operationally viable social insurance systems.
The new strategy does not represent an abrupt break with past activities, but rather a forward-looking, results-oriented and longer-term development focus that is based on solid evidence of past results, lessons learned, evolving needs and new technologies.  For health and social protection activities, there has been a smooth transition as the Mission’s new strategy went into effect in October 2003.  Many of the previously-established activities are being continued, others have been refined and modified, and those which have reached their goals were closed out. 
The Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, the primary host government ministry with which the Advisor is expected to interact, is like most Government of Armenia (GOAM) entities, weak institutionally, resource poor, and suffers from severely inadequate budget levels.  This grim reality underscores the need for social sector reforms leading to the development of sustainable systems for social insurance, welfare and pensions for the most vulnerable populations within this country, where an estimated 55 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.

II.	Duties and Responsibilities

The Social Sector Advisor will serve as the Team Leader for the SO 3.4 team.
The incumbent will advise on general responsibilities to meet USAID’s strategic goals, provide policy guidance, and review work in terms of overall accomplishment of desired results.  The Advisor is expected to function as a senior professional, and carry out his/her work with minimal supervision, providing technical guidance to FSN staff, other contractors, partners and customers in the development, implementation and monitoring/evaluation of program activities.

The Social Sector Advisor will be expected to draw upon experiences from a wide range of disciplines in performing his/her duties.  New activities in the social sector area are expected to be fully integrated with other strategic priorities in the Mission’s portfolio, including economic development, short-term employment generation, civil service reform, alternative service provision, and local government/non-governmental organization development.
 
The Advisor will be required to provide accurate and informed advice to the Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of social sector issues with particular emphasis on policy reform.  She/He will provide leadership in the technical and policy reform area to Mission Management, Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, partners, counterparts and customers.  The counterparts and customers will look to the Advisor to present viable and pertinent options to social sector issues.
   
The incumbent has the following duties and responsibilities:
 
•	The Advisor will provide substantive technical and advocacy leadership for USAID/Armenia’s social transition program.  This will include, but not be limited to: 1) identifying achievable development results in collaboration with USAID customers; 2) establishing dialogue with and obtaining/maintaining support from partners, customers and stakeholders; 3) obtaining Washington agreement on development results and related financing; and 4) obtaining Mission level approvals for initiating development activities.
 
•	The Advisor will facilitate achievement of social transition program goals to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.  This includes the planning, management, reporting and budgeting responsibilities for SO 3.4 activities. 
 
•	The Social Sector Advisor will be responsible for ensuring the acceptable performance and completion of contract scopes-of-work (SOWs) for technical assistance and commodity procurement, terms of reference (TORs), work plans, delivery orders, budget tasks, and specifications by the short and long-term technical advisors as well as institutional contractors.  He/she will make periodic project site visits and write reports with observations and recommendations.
 
•	The Advisor will meet with host country officials and customers to determine needs for assistance in the sector, as well as meet periodically with other donors to report and coordinate programs and activities.  The Advisor will be responsible for identifying opportunities for USAID/Armenia to leverage other donor resources in support of USAID/Armenia’s social sector reform agenda.

•	She/he will assist in the development of a program of training and exchanges for social sector policy makers and professionals in Armenia.

•	The Advisor will be responsible for the recruitment, training and career development of competent social sector development FSN professionals, as required.
 
•	Other job-related duties as assigned.
 
 III.          Supervisory Controls 
 
This position will be supervised by the Director, Office of Democracy and Social Reform or his/her designee.   
 

IV.       Skills and Qualifications

•	An in-depth knowledge of the concepts, principles, techniques, and practices of a professional field, in or directly related to the social sector, in particular social insurance, social assistance, and education;
