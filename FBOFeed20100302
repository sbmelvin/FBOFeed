<SUBJECT>58 -- JOINT STARS MISSION AREA ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES (AOA) RFI
<SOLNBR>R2350
<CONTACT>David Knox david.knox@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:david.knox@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>Joint STARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONTHIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.The Air Force is undergoing a re-assessment of their "Joint STARS Mission Area" requirements.  The "Joint STARS Mission Area" refers to a wide area airborne ground surveillance capability (detection, tracking, and classification of ground and surface movers), and the associated Battle Management and Command and Control (BMC2) capabilities necessary for real-time exploitation of the sensor data, sensor management, processing, display, and communications to enable F2T2EA (find, fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess) of mobile ground and maritime targets.  Operations over the past several years have revealed areas where improved capabilities for ground moving target surveillance are required.  These requirements are being captured in the "Joint STARS Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)", currently in DoD coordination.  Key areas of improvement are tracking individual movers through high traffic density conditions, ground/surface moving target classification, and detection and tracking of dismounts.    The United States Air Force is planning to conduct a survey in the near future to evaluate options to meeting the Joint STARS Mission Area capability needs (represented by the sum of the Joint STARS ORD and the Joint STARS Mission Area ICD).  Options considered will include enhancements and upgrades to existing systems and/or development and deployment of new systems. The survey will have a specific focus on the sensor and platform operational effectiveness, suitability, and life-cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy established capability needs.The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify contractors that will be proposing potential Sensor/Platform System solutions in support of a future acquisition activity to deliver capability in support of the Joint STARS Mission area. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI.  The Government requests interested sources that intend to propose a Sensor/Platform solution submit an information package with respect to the topics below.  All responders must have Personnel, facilities and storage with SECRET clearances. The information packages must indicate the source's intent to define/provide a Sensor/Platform solution or whether your interest relates to developing/providing elements (i.e., engineering services and/or components of hardware/software) of a solution.  Potential offerors should also identify if they qualify as a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business and whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Information packages should describe the following 
1.  Offeror's experience with respect the Joint STARS Mission Area2.  Offeror's experience on Programs that required the design, development, integration, and test of large-scale and complex airborne sensor and command and control systems. 3. Offeror's experience on Programs that required experience with military command and control operations 4. Offeror's experience on Programs that required experience with developing Sensors that meet the open systems architecture principles, processes, and practices.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this RFI.
Responses must be submitted via CD-ROM along with two paper copies.  The Government requested that Offeror's provide a synopsis, of no more than 10 single-sided pages, 12-point, Times New Roman font, minimum one-inch margins, in Microsoft Word format.  In addition to the synopsis, a cover page or cover letter may be included for offerors interested in defining/providing a Sensor/Platform solution or whether your interest relates to developing/providing elements (i.e., engineering services and/or components of hardware/software) of a solution.  Request that your RFI response be submitted on or before 15 March 2010.  There will be an Industry Day scheduled to occur within 30 business days after RFI responses are submitted.  Further information on the Joint STARS Mission Area AoA Industry Day will be provided via the HERBB.  We anticipate having one-on-one meetings with offerors at the Industry Day to provide you an opportunity to discuss your RFI response and any other necess! ary information.  We will be forthcoming with the final details for Industry Day, please continue to monitor the HERBB website for information.Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

<CONTACT>Jerrod T Whittington, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 226-1940, Email jwhittin@aoc.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Architect of the Capitol is the creator and caretaker of the US Capitol complex and for more than 200 years has applied ingenuity and craftsmanship to serve Congress, preserve history, and sustain the home of American democracy.   

The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible to the United States Congress for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the Capitol, Congressional office buildings, Capitol Visitor Center, the Library of Congress buildings, the Supreme Court building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and other facilities.

AOC.gov is comprised of approximately 600 pages and serves as the public face of the Agency for more than 3 million visitors to the site each year. Approximately 70% of the visitors are from the United States and 30% are from sites around the world. 

AOC.gov is also the top site within Google for high profile searches such as Capitol and US Capitol. 

SYNOPSIS:  The AOC anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for redesign of AOC.gov.  This RFP will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about 1 April 2010 on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov). Please be advised the 1 April 2010 date for solicitation posting is estimated and the actual posting date may be after the estimated date. Please address any questions to Jerrod Whittington, Contract Specialist, via email at jwhittin@aoc.gov. Telephone inquires will not be acknowledged or accepted.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project seeks to transcend the typical, and reinvent AOC.gov, with an award-winning design, to become as visually stunning and as memorable as an in-person visit to the U.S. Capitol. This project will enhance the design of AOC.gov to be reflective of the stature and symbolism of the buildings of the Capitol and surrounding campus. The project will enhance the visitor experience for the wide-range of audiences accessing the site.

Following an analysis and recommendation for design based on site metrics, audience profiles, and client goals, the selected vendor will develop web design templates for AOC.gov based on AOC brand standards that can be applied to the existing AOC.gov web content management system (PaperThin CommonSpot v.5). This design will include colors, fonts, layouts and navigation structure/information architecture for the AOC.gov home page and related sub-pages. 

The design shall support the mission of the AOC.gov site to inform and educate AOC stakeholders and the general public about the history, current operations and future plans for the Capitol Campus.
 
An additional option within the project will be the application of the client-approved design templates across the AOC.gov site and assistance in search engine optimization/metadata to assist key audiences in accessing the content they are seeking.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, intends to award a contract modification under contract W15QKN-08-C-0062 to Canadian Commercial Corporation on behalf of General Dynamics Ordinance and Tactical System Valleyfield, the only manufacturer currently qualified to produce the M31A2 Triple Base propellant, to support manufacture of M232A1 propelling charges, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B).

The anticipated modification would cover additional quantities up to 6,130,000 pounds of M31A2 propellant. This effort would be in support of MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System) program. The 155mm M231/M232 series propelling charges, know as MACS, consist of two (2) different propelling charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete zoning solution for 155mm Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic increment.  The M231 charges are used at lower zones (Zones 1 & 2), while M232 series charges are used at progressively higher zones as required.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL), Aug. 1996.  Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751, ET SEQ) and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and 5230.25.

<DESC>The Directorate of Contracting, Fort Hood, Texas intends to procure maintenance services for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 USC 2304(1) as implemented  by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Government intends to enter into a firm fixed price bridge contract with Shane Gelling Company, 98 Prospect Avenue, Seacliff, NY 11579 for a period of 6 months from 1 April 2010 through 30 September 2010.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 561621 Security System Services with a size standard of $12.5M.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE  QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued.   This proposed bridge contract will allow the Government time to pursue a competitive, long term contract action.  Initiating a separate competitive action for a 6-month bridge contract would not outweigh the benefits to the Government. Time does not permit a phase-in period, therefore, there is not a reasonable expectation a new contractor will successfully perform without critical delays and/or interruption of service. Questions should be directed to Rebecca Coon via email to: rebecca.coon@us.army.mil or the Contracting Officer, at susheep.oden@us.army.mil.

To execute this mission, MTO supports revolutionary research in electronics, photonics, MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new capabilities to sense, communicate, energize, actuate, and process data and information for the war fighter.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">MTO regularly publishes Broad Agency Announcements requesting responses to specific program topics. This announcement seeks revolutionary research ideas for topics not being addressed by ongoing MTO programs or other published BAA solicitations. This BAA is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research (Studies) that may lead to larger, focused, MTO programs in the future. Studies are defined as single phase efforts of short duration (&lt; 12 months) costing less than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whereas proposers are strongly encouraged to submit Studies to this BAA, Multi-Phase Efforts will also be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts are efforts with more than one phase that may span longer than 12 months and that may cost more than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts must also cover discernable research topic areas that lead to clearly defined, quantitative technical metrics.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08272011
<CONTACT>Dr. William Harrod, Dr. William Harrod, Email DARPA-BAA-10-37@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of computer system research and development. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.
<p>To address these concerns the UHPC program will pursue, but will not be limited to: <br /><br />1) development and optimization of ExtremeScale architectures, technologies, execution models, and the critical co-design of hardware and software;</p>
<p>2) low-energy architectures and protocols for logic, memory, data access, and data transport;</p>
<p>3) dynamic systems that adapt to achieve optimal application execution goals;</p>
<p>4) dependable computer systems including resiliency and security at all system levels;</p>
<p>5) concurrency management and the efficient use of massively parallel resources;</p>
<p>6) locality-aware architectures to reduce data movement;<br /><br />7) self-aware OS that manages real-time performance, dependability and system resources.</p>
<p>The UHPC program will develop solutions for radically new computer systems that overcome energy efficiency, dependability, and programmability challenges. The UHPC vision includes:</p>
<p>Efficiency: New system-wide (hardware and software) technology approaches to minimize energy dissipation per operation and maximize energy efficiency, without sacrificing scalability to ultra-high performance DoD applications.</p>
<p>Programmability: Develop new scalable system architectures and technologies that do not require application programmers to explicitly manage system complexity, in terms of architectural attributes with respect to data locality and concurrency, to achieve performance, time to solution and other goals.</p>
<p>Dependability: Develop a system-wide approach to achieve dependability through fault management techniques enabling an application to execute correctly through both failures and attacks, and to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information, while achieving the user's goals. These goals could include performance, time to solution, energy efficiency or power consumption. Dependability across all levels of a UHPC System Design that is nearly transparent to the user and hardware performance.</p>
<p>To realize this vision requires reinventing how computers process and manage data and how applications are developed and executed. UHPC System Designs that merely pursue evolutionary development will not be considered.</p>
<p><br />The UHPC Program will pursue research and development efforts that will explore the technologies and architectures required to enable the development of revolutionary computing systems and overcome "business as usual" advances. Scaling current technology and justifying this approach with feature size reduction arguments cannot accomplish the goals of the program. This can only be achieved via dedicated investment, hardware-software co-design, integrated design techniques that utilize open innovation. Since creating an open innovation environment will be a critical element throughout the UHPC program and heavily weighted in all program evaluations, it should be an important consideration in team formation and plans for working with researchers outside of the proposed team. It must be noted that innovation for the sake of innovation will not be sufficient; proposers must demonstrate the viability, applicability and value to the overall UHPC System Design. Computers based on a UHPC System Designs will deliver extreme scale performance for modern DoD computational applications. It is assumed that system designs developed under this program will be scalable to systems ranging from embedded terascale systems up through at least single cabinet petascale configurations.<br /><br />Full Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is attached.</p>

<DESC>The US Forest Service (USFS), Willamette National Forest, Detroit Ranger District, intends to issue a sole source contract to purchase a replacement floating restroom for Detroit Lake from Western Fabrication, 92334 Riekkola Rd, Astoria, OR, 97103-6654, the only vendor fabricating this State approved facility design.  Detroit Lake is the highest boating use lake in the State.  There is a need to have adequate sewage facilities at the reservoir to protect water quality that downstream municipalities depend on.  The existing floating restroom has passed its useful life span, and has health and safety concerns.  Currently, there are no other comparable floating restroom designs or fabricators that build this design that meet State and Federal standards for stability, safety, durability, barrier free accessibility, environmental precaution measures, and regulatory agency approval.  The Oregon Marine Board's floating restroom design has been accepted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for containment and collection of sewage on the water.  The barge component of the floating restroom has been stamped and approved by an USCG Naval Architect and the superstructure (toilet/mechanical rooms) has been stamped by a Civil Engineer.  There is no other floating restroom design that uses a water ballasted barge system that ensures stability, which is necessary for conditions at Detroit Lake. This provides a higher level of security and safety for the user.  The U.S. Forest Service, Willamette National Forest, intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract for the supply stated. 

This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6-302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. 

The solicitation number assigned to this effort is AG-04T0-S-10-0006 and it will be issued on or about fifteen (15) days after release of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>RECOVERY The National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth (Data Coordinating Center)   This Project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) action. Receipt of award is contingent upon the offeror's meeting the requirements of Section 1512 (reports of use of funds) of the Recovery Act.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Contracts Management Branch, Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a sole source modification to the contract with Clinical Trials and Surveys Corp., Contract HHSN275200800003I/HHSN27500001.  The contractor currently supports the study for the National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth and is required to establish standardized data collection for the study.  In addition, implement laboratory specimen tracking mechanisms and working with the project officer to implement a randomization plan for the assignment of subjects in the study.  The contractor is also responsible for statistical support, the accuracy of the data collected and the analysis of clinical data.    

The primary purposes of this study are: (1) to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) to create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth; (3) to improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation; and (4) to construct an individualized standard for fundal height.  This multicenter, prospective study, which officially commenced on September 26, 2008, is being conducted at four clinical sites in the U.S.  The study involves the recruitment and follow-up of (1) 2,400 low-risk, normal weight women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; (2) 600 obese women; and (3) 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimentinoal (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.  Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.  After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will be carefully taken.  Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.  Recruitment began on July 15, 2009 and is expected to last at least two calendar years.  

The planned modification will require the contractor to meet additional requirements as they manage, coordinate and monitor potential additional clinical sites in the study.  
The contractor will also be required to collect additional images associated with the added twin component of the study, and assist in the continuous quality control procedures for all ultrasound measures.  Nutritional surveys will be administered to all study participants (rather than only a portion of the participants as is done now); consequently the contractor will be responsible for the collection of the additional data.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interests and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received with 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  This Project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) action. Receipt of award is contingent upon the offeror's meeting the requirements of Section 1512 (reports of use of funds) of the Recovery Act.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate a sole source modification(s) with Columbia University (HHSN275200800013C), the Medical University of South Carolina (HHSN275200800014C) the University of California, Irvine (HHSN275200800028C) and Northwestern University (HHSN275200800012C).  The Government is currently conducting a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth. The study aims to recruit (1) 2,400 low risk women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; and (2) 600 obese women.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive five scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3 dimensional (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.   Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.   After delivery neonatal anthropometic measures will be carefully taken.   Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.   Blood samples will be collected at enrollment, at 16 to 18 weeks, 24 to 28 weeks in all subjects and at 6 weeks postpartum in selected subjects.  Placental tissues will be collected in selected subjects.  

The planned modification will permit the current contractor sites to add twin pregnancies to the study population and enhance the investigation of nutritional factors on fetal growth by administering the dietary questionnaires to all participants within a 24 month period.  Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the FAR 6.3201-1, Only one Responsible Source.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition of this requirement unfeasible.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interests and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.
The project is located at the King Gillette Ranch, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, California.  
THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN PROCUREMENT.  The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract  based upon a two-phase selection procedure.  The project solicitation consists of two (2) phases.  This Pre-solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process.  To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220 and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 million.  This project is available to all responsible Design-Build contractors nationwide meeting the above-referenced NAICS code under FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
The Scope of Work (SOW) includes a design/build project to rehabilitate an existing 6000 square foot building for a visitor center and construct a new 1000 square foot restroom structure.  The project also includes a new 50-car parking area, entry plaza, paths and related site work.  The new facility will be a showcase for sustainable design and construction.  Features include a 70kw photo voltaic system, a ground and water source heat pump system, a wetlands-based sewage treatment system, an incandescent-free lighting system, and numerous other green building features.  It will achieve a LEED Platinum rating and function as a net-zero energy use facility by producing all of the annual energy needs onsite via the use of renewable energy sources, thus having a zero carbon footprint for facility operation.
The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design (SD) drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two).  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions may be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  The project process will follow National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ).
The estimated price is between $ 5,000,000.00 and $7,000,000.00, including all design and construction services.  The contract provides for preparation of Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CDs).  ARRA funding has been secured for this project.
For Phase One, all Design-Build (D-B) firms that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit qualifications until 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), March 17, 2010.  Qualifications will be evaluated based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance:

1.  Demonstrate experience in designing and constructing similar facilities (visitor centers, museums, or welcome centers)
2. Past Performance
	a.  Demonstrate past performance on  design/build projects, especially experience that the offeror's current A-E/construction company partnership has working together.  Include any examples that demonstrate proven performance in meeting tight project schedules.  
	b. Demonstrate past performance in providing innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost; 

3. Demonstrate experience in completing LEED-certified projects.  Demonstrate an understanding of how to create a "net-zero" energy use facility.
4. Demonstrate experience with specialized sustainable technology installations, including photo-voltaic systems, ground and water loop heat pump systems, extensive day-lighting treatments, ultra low energy-use equipment, and on-site wetland based sewage treatment systems.
5. Demonstrate experience and ability to use project management tools and techniques such as MS-Project, resource-loaded scheduling, fast-track scheduling, Critical Path Method and earned value analysis.
Design-Build (D-B) firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit qualifications to the office indicated below for Phase One evaluation.  
The Brooks Act does not apply to this procurement as the acquisition is NOT for Architect-Engineer Services.  However, a Standard Form (SF) 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications may be used to submit qualifications, but is not required.  The SF 330's are formatted for Architect-Engineer (A-E) and related services, but this form can be used for both design and construction qualifications.  The SF 330 can be downloaded from the forms library section at following website:  http://www.gsa.gov.

(Mountain Time Zone), March 17, 2010, will be evaluated further.  Up to Four (4) of the most highly-qualified Design-Build (D-B) firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this Design-Build selection process.
In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent the Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the NPS Schematic Design Drawings, project requirements narrative, Performance Technical Specifications (PTS), and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.  Offerors will be asked to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposal.  The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal.  A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals for Phase Two.  Large business contractors will be expected to submit a sub-contracting plan and subcontract at least 19.5% of the award total to small businesses.
Short-listed offerors will be asked to submit both a technical and price proposal based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP.  Award of a single contract will be made to the "Best Value" offeror by approximately June 15, 2010.  Debriefings will be made available after contract award.

<DESC>NAVFAC SW, San Diego, CA, is preparing to release an RFP for Habitat Enhancement Services at various locations in Arizona, California and Nevada.
This procurement is a 100% Small Business (SB) set-aside with the intent to award a single firm-fixed indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for Habitat Enhancement Services. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  The aggregate total of all task orders issued under the resulting contract shall not exceed $15,000,000.  
The habitat enhancement services are primarily focused on native habitat restoration and erosion control activities including site preparation, revegetation, installation of erosion control features and materials, and exotic plant control at various locations in Arizona, California, and Nevada. Work includes but is not limited to propagating native plants; site recontouring; seeding and/or planting of disturbed areas; maintenance of planted areas until successful; mapping and control of exotic plant species using chemical and/or mechanical means: ripping, blocking and replanting excess trails; the establishment of a variety of revegetation plots and the development of new techniques and approaches.  Projects may occur in areas with rare or federally listed species so that biological, mapping, biomonitoring, and fencing for resource and species protection may be required.  The work completed under this contract is vital to the sustainable land management on military installations and thereby ensures the continuation of realistic military training on the installations.  
Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable. The contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract. 
A pre-proposal site visit/meeting for proposed Task Order 0001 will be conducted at the Remote Training Site, Warner Springs, California.  The exact date and location will be provided at a later date.  All firms interested in attending the site visit must submit the following information by email no later than 11 March 2010 to Ms. Elia Ram at elia.ram@navy.mil or Fax at (619) 532-1155:  Full name of individual(s) attending, social security number, date of birth, citizenship, drivers license number and state, company name, phone and fax numbers, vehicle information:  year, make, model, color, and license plate number.  Due to space limitations, participation is limited to two (2) representatives from each prime contractor. It is highly recommended that firms interested in attending the pre-proposal site visit bring a four-wheel drive vehicle capable of driving along unpaved roads that receive limited maintenance.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.
The Government reserves the right not to award Proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract.
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors and sub-factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance/Safety, Factor 2 - Technical Experience, Factor 3 - Scenario, Factor 4 - Technical Approach to Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001, and Factor 5 - Price.  Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 are of equal importance to each other.  Within Factor 1, the Sub-factors 1.1 - Past Performance of the Offeror and Offeror's Team, and 1.2 - Past Performance Safety of the Offeror and Offeror's Team are equal in importance; and within Factor 2, the Sub-factor 2.1 - Technical Experience of the Offeror and Offeror's Team, 2.2 - Technical Experience of key Personnel, and 2.3 - Business Plan are equal in importance.  Factor 5 - Price is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined are significantly more important than Factor 5 - Price.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  
The solicitation will be available by electronic media only and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://neco.navy.mil or http://www.eps.gov under pre-solicitation notice N62473-10-R-0803.  There will be no paper copies of this solicitation issued.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will be the only method of distribution; therefore, it is the offeror(s) responsibility to check the web site periodically for any amendment to this solicitation. Offeror(s) must be registered in the Contractor's Central Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov in order to participate in this procurement.   
The solicitation issue date is on or about 17 March 2010. The closing date set for receipt of proposals is 16 April 2010, 2:00 PM local time.  The primary POC for this solicitation is Elia Ram at 619-532-3074.  Site visit information and questions should be submitted by email to elia.ram@navy.mil or faxed to 619-532-1155.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: SEE SUBCONTRACTING GOALS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN. 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), renamed by Executive Order in 1999, is located in Washington DCs Presidential Park, immediately west of The White House. This National Historic Landmark (NHL) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, the EEOB was built between 1871-1888 to house the growing staff of the Departments of State, War, and Navy, and is considered among the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. Restoration of interior building spaces began in 1983. Since then, main corridors, libraries, stairwell domes, stained glass rotundas, and certain offices have been restored. Originally known as the State, War, and Navy Building, the EEOB housed the three departments associated with formulating and conducting the nations foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century  the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed many of the nations most significant diplomats, politicians and military leaders and has been the scene of many historic events. 

Due to its proximity to the White House, the EEOB houses a majority of the White House Staff offices.  The building houses the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, White House Counsel, and numerous other offices critical to the Presidential Administration. The EEOB is currently undergoing a 3 phased multi-year modernization and security upgrade. As the modernizations programmatic requirements evolved, it became clear that a new ADA compliant security screening facility and entrance was needed for employees, guests, and dignitaries. However, the exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project are still under discussion and exploration. The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on government estimates and projections.  GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the constraints of this project, its complex environment, historic preservation requirements, and the potential impact on contributing historical resources, GSA will require the services of our nations most talented lead designer for performance of architectural bridging design document services.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural bridging design document services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.

The proposed facility will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by EOP OA and USSS UD, the design of the facility and site must meet stringent federal security requirements. The screening facility will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The White House Security Guidelines and the United States Secret Services Technical Security Division have determined the classification level for this project. All judgments and proposed amendments to stated classification determinations must be presented to and approved by the United States Secret Service and White House Security.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

The project may provide approximately 800 GSF of new construction and adaptation of a National Historic Landmark. The intent of this project is to serve the needs of tenant agencies by providing a new ADA compliant building access and security screening facility. The new facility will function as a screening, credentialing, and holding area for employees, guests, and dignitaries wishing to gain entrance to the EEOB. A satisfactory outcome will meet tenant agency requirements with new construction that relates successfully to the surrounding urban landscape, architecture and historical context.  The scope of architectural bridging design documents services will include: architecture; civil; historical preservation; interior design; urban site and landscape design; and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. Due to the sensitive nature of the proposed facilitys location and function, this Design Excellence opportunity will ONLY ADDRESS THE ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT of the facility. These Design Excellence architectural bridging design documents shall be categorized as Sensitive but Unclassified.  All mechanical, electrical, plumbing, communications, IT, security, fire protection, physical security, and all other sensitive components of the facility will be integrated into the bridging design documents by the subsequent design-build firm. A design firm, which holds proper facility clearances, will be utilized as an advisor for any coordination or implementation issues during the architectural bridging document development that involve classified systems or details. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 

The goals for this procurement are as follows: complete a client program evaluation defining the project and programmatic requirements and provide architectural bridging design document services.  A design-build contractor, under a separate solicitation, will use the architectural bridging documents as bases for a full design. This procurement is to address the architectural bridging design only and will not address classified systems, components, or processes. 

All conceptual/bridging design work will be required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation.  Design submissions will include: an illustrated preservation report identifying all relevant design details, potential conflicts with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards and solutions for preventing all adverse effects, as defined in the NHPA, while achieving project goals. The Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO) must evaluate each design concept for compliance with all applicable preservation standards. The RHPO may request and coordinate additional design reviews based on their interpretation of each design submission. The lead designer and A/E team will 1. Participate in design consultations and presentations for project approvals by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA); 2. Fully engage  tenants in the planning and design of the screening facility and its thoughtful integration into the EEOB, its historic landscape and urban context- the Presidential Park precinct; 3. Develop an architectural bridging design that maintains and enhances the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; 4. Balance historic preservation with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting, and 5. Respect, incorporate, and interpret the significance of the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildings past, and that of Pennsylvania Avenue; 6. Subscribe to the Design Excellence goals; 7. Produce an architectural bridging design capable of achieving  a  level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet or exceed the United States Green Building Councils (USGBC) Silver LEED rating; 8. Plan and design to promote reciprocal natural views and sightlines from Pennsylvania Avenue to the EEOB; 9. Engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities which will accomplish preservation of adjacent historic setting and urban context and 10. Integrate basic operational and physical security elements within the Presidential Park precinct.

<p><br />William Saad<br />Managing Director, IHS (Nigeria) Plc.<br />19 Bishop Aboyade Cole Street<br />P.M.B. 80167, Victoria Island<br />Lagos, Nigeria<br />Phone: +234 12 800 790<br />Email: william@ihsnigeria.com</p>
<p>The Grantee, IHS (Nigeria) Plc., invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Solar Powered Communications Towers Technical Assistance Project.</p>
<p>The Grantee is a publicly traded Nigerian company that serves as a neutral third-party infrastructure manager, making it possible for competing telecommunications operators to collocate their equipment, a practice which translates into significant cost savings. The Grantee constructs communications towers, buys existing towers, leases tower space to clients, and manages tower sites on clients' behalf.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee their customers adequate, uninterrupted power, the Grantee powers all of its sites with diesel generators. Sites must be refueled on a weekly basis, which accounts for over 50% of the Grantee's operating costs. This dependence also exposes the Grantee to market fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel, making cost management and financial forecasting extremely difficult.</p>
<p>To mitigate the vulnerability and high costs associated with diesel generation, the Grantee is interested in deploying solar power and other alternative energy solutions at its tower sites. This Technical Assistance is intended to assist the Grantee in evaluating energy alternatives, developing performance specifications for its tower sites, and arranging a technical visit to the United States for the Grantee to meet with U.S. companies offering renewable energy solutions. The Grantee hopes to use this opportunity to attract a U.S. company to establish a pilot demonstration at one of its tower sites in Nigeria in order to verify the proposed solutions' technical viability and cost savings in the Grantee's operating environment, and to develop an implementation plan for scaling up the solution to a larger number of the Grantee's tower sites.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $162,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal electronically, in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local time on April 2, 2010 at the above e-mail address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.The Department of Veterans Affairs, West Palm Beach intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source task/delivery order for Architect/Engineer Services with EMTEC Corporation for the design of installation of fan coil unit cooling systems in 30 telephone/data closets.  The proposed task/delivery order will be issued against the current open-ended Architect/Engineer Contract with EMTEC, V548P-1209.  The existing contract was previously competed.EMTEC will design a project to install units in the 30 most critical telephone/data closets in the medical center.  Currently the telephone/data closets are cooled using the air handler units feeding the Medical Center.  Engineering implemented Time of Day Programs for the air handlers for areas that are used only Monday-Friday.  Air handlers shut off in areas where there are no occupants.  Since the telephone/data closets now contain processer/computers controlling telephone and data, the time of day programs cannot be used due to overheating of the computer equipment.  Installing fan coil units in these closets will allow for time of day programming on the main air handlers and these smaller fan coils will allow 24/7 cooling in these closets.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  All information received by 12 noon EST, 8 March 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  NAICS code is 541310, with a size standard of $4.5M. No solicitation documents are available.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Interested parties may e-mail information to debra.becht2@va.gov .

<DESC><p>This notice seeks information on potential sources for a contemplated, firm-fixed-price contract in support of the 46th Test Group (46TG) effort to assess Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) missile damage on large aircraft engines. The purpose of this planned contract involves predicting MANPADS damage effects on rotating General Electric (GE) manufactured CF6-50 engines. Tasks include consulting with the 46TG concerning the CF6-50 engine as it relates to MANPADS testing, verifying that the two CF6-50 test engines (owned by the 46TG and located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) are correctly configured for test operation, providing expertise for selection of a shotline, and generating LS-DYNA predictions of MANPADS damage with and without warhead detonation with the given shotline. Damage predictions must be delivered to the 46TG by 15 December 2010 and a detailed technical report concerning the predictions is due by 15 March 2011. The Government will provide the SA-7 MANPADS Missile Model as Government Furnished Property.<br />In addition to the technical challenges of this planned contract, proprietary data is involved for which the Government has only limited rights. Therefore, the Government does not have a technical data package it can provide potential offerors relative to the CF6-50 aircraft engine or the CF6-50 engine model (LS-DYNA). <br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, with a small business standard size of 500 employees. Interested and capable sources are encouraged to respond to this synopsis with a Statement of Capability detailing similar efforts, evidence of the ability to obtain proprietary data from General Electric, and an explanation of your ability to perform the above tasks. In addition to a Statement of Capabilities, firms responding to this announcement should include company name, CAGE code, point of contact, address, and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Please limit your Statement of Capability to no more than 10 pages. If e-mailing your Statement of Capability, please send it in a PDF or MS Word format. Responses should be submitted to Colin McCranie, Contract Specialist, by e-mail no later than 16 March 2010 at colin.mccranie@eglin.af.mil or by facsimile to (850) 882-4651.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the purpose of conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet Air Force needs in designing and building a dual-band (X/UHF) radar system capable of performing persistent, wide-area surveillance. The Gotcha radar concept is an airborne, wide angle, staring radar that provides significant improvements in several ground surveillance functions. The data is collected in a single radar mode, but is processed into several different data products such as video Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) with Minimum Detectable Velocity (MDV), Coherent Change Detection (CCD), Super-resolution 2D imagery, and 3D SAR imagery. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.
<p>The objective of the Gotcha Spiral II Radar System program is to create a radar system capable of Gotcha mode processing techniques over a wider "city-sized" area of 10km (threshold) to 20km (objective) diameter spot. This system will also be able to support near real-time data distribution for ground processing. Utilizing a dual, high/low band radar configuration will improve CCD and enable foliage penetration (FOPEN).</p>
<p>The program consists of 2 phases:<br />--Phase I (System Design)<br />--Phase II (System Build - including testing and demonstration)</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOCs) reflecting their interest and capability in meeting the above requirements. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical areas under consideration as outlined above, and on each of the following qualifications:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - provide an outline of projects, specific work previously performed, or any-in house research and development effort or similar type work that is currently being performed.</p>
<p>(2) Personnel - provide the names, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists, engineers, and technical personnel (i.e. principal investigator, project officer) who may be assigned to perform in the technical areas under consideration.</p>
<p>(3) Facilities - provide availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.</p>
<p>(4) Security - provide a statement regarding industry security clearance.</p>
<p>(5) Other - provide any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.</p>
<p>Please include the following information with your response: name and address of firm, point of contact and telephone number, business size (i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, HBCU/MI - historically black colleges and universities/minority institutions).</p>
<p>Statements of Capabilities are due electronically to the Air Force no later than 17 Mar 2010, and shall be forwarded to the following e-mail address: gail.nyikon@wpafb.af.mil. Address contractual questions to Gail Nyikon, Contract Negotiator, (937) 255-5402, or Doug Covey, Contracting Officer, (937) 656-9003 and technical questions to Tom Lewis, Sr. Electronics Engineer, (937) 255-6427 x4347, or John Reynolds, RF Systems Engineer, (937) 255-6427 x4349.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought for a Sodium Treatment System Design
The Department of Energy-Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is considering issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) as a small business set-a-side for the design of a Sodium Treatment System. Large and Small Business concerns may participate as teaming partners, provided that they meet the small business standards at FAR Part 19 and other applicable requirements.  Firms that are currently teaming partners under contract DE-AC07-05ID-14516 are excluded from participation in any award resulting from the subsequent RFP in accordance with FAR Part 9.
This system must be designed to treat remote-handled radiological waste containing primarily sodium and some sodium potassium (NaK) materials to render it non-reactive for disposal purposes. DOE-ID may issue a contract for partial system design with options for final design, fabrication and installation in an existing hot cell at the Idaho National Laboratory. 
The waste is in about 230 containers (including eight cold traps and two nuclide traps) with approximately 1,500 gallons of bulk sodium and 90 gallons of NaK in total. Dose readings on contact range from 0.1 millirem per hour up to 15,000 rem per hour. About 26 of the containers have transuranic constituents. The small qualified concern should have experience designing and installing similar systems that treat radiological waste with sodium and/or NaK, or be able to specifically demonstrate the capability to perform the work. 
If your firm is interested and you believe you are qualified, please provide the following:
1)	A statement describing the company?s interest in performing the work2)	Brief background of capabilities3)	Previous relevant experience4)	Demonstrated ability of treating radiological sodium and NaK containing waste5)	Primary contact person name with contact information.
DOE will only review submittals with 10 pages or less

Questions may be posted on Fed Biz Ops until close of business on March 15, 2010.  All answers will also be posted on Fed Biz Ops.  
Responses must be received at DOE-ID by Friday, March 19, 2010 at 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time by e-mail (not through Fed Biz Ops) to Ron Fellows at the following email address:	 Fellowrg@id.doe.gov

<p class="MsoNormal">The NAICS code for this project is 541720.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The small business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: black;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Over the past few decades there has been an increase in the number of initiatives funded by both governmental and non-governmental agencies to solve complex societal, environmental, and public health problems. These large initiatives require collaborative work and cross-disciplinary inquiries, which has contributed to a pronounced shift from individually-oriented research behaviors toward team-based scientific endeavors.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), National Cancer Institute (NCI) has funded several large transdisciplinary center initiatives since 1999, tackling complex health problems in an array of domains. <span>&nbsp;</span>DCCPS seeks support for its mission to </span>study the methods and processes associated with team science and determine ways to define, track and measure efficiency and success of such initiatives.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this project is to conduct innovative bibliometric studies to assess the value and productivity of the Transdisciplinary Research in Energetics and Cancer initiative (TREC). There are four major objectives to achieve: 1) to assess TREC research productivity using a rigorous research design; 2) to assess the evolution of the TREC publications and their unique contribution to the overall landscape of the energetics and energy balance field by utilizing scientific mapping and visualizing techniques; 3) to examine the relationship between collaborative antecedent and process factors and the TREC research outcomes; and 4) to incorporate qualitative methods for assessing the quality, impact, and level of transdisciplinarity of TREC publications.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with OEWaves Inc., of Pasadena, CA, to modify an existing Purchase Order to include the purchase of a system upgrade for an existing model OE8000A PM-Noise Measurement System.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for a system upgrade for the model OE8000A PM-Noise Measurement System which is an automated phase-noise measurement rack/module and controller using a novel, highly specialized "homodyne" measurement technique capable of 6 GHz spans without the need for a low-noise tunable reference synthesizer or high-purity oscillator to cover at least 24 - 40 GHz. NIST's OEWaves System OE8000A is the only instrument that can measure at the required NIST levels and accuracy using NIST's fixed-frequency standards while measuring such a large frequency span. The upgraded instrument must provide direct phase-noise measurements in oscillators at the highest possible accuracy and lowest noise &lsquo;floor' at in 6 GHz spans to at least cover 24 - 40 GHz. This modification, which implements what is called the &lsquo;cross-correlation' technique, enables the existing NIST instrument to achieve accuracy and noise floor at 24 - 40 GHz per the original OEWaves specification. OEWaves has exclusive license rights under various patents and is the only company that can upgrade and extend the frequency range of its System. Delivery date shall be 110 days ARO.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: 
National Park Service - Chaco Culture National Historic Park, Denver MABO 
2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: 
The telecom system that provides voice service and voicemail to the park needs to be relocated as a result of renovation of the Visitor Center.  
3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): 
The services required are the disassembly, migration, and re-installation of the Business Communication Module, Integrated Voice mail, switches and phones.  Additionally, the system has to be configured with a compatible wireless device since the new trailers do not have cabling to supply data or telecom.
Estimated value is between $25,000 and 50,000
4.  Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4))
6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: 
This park is basically paying for the phone project twice due to the sequence in which the work has been done.  It is inefficient and costly.  However, with the initial project the park paid for a 15 month warranty.  If another contractor comes in and works on / moves the system the park loses that 15 month warranty.  Making this a sole source acquisition allows the government to keep the 15 month warranty and thus decreases the inefficiency slightly.  
6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2, and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies: 
We have made no attempts to solicit from other potential sources.  We contacted the vendor who did the original work (who still holds our warranty), and we were informed that if another company performs the work done for this contract the warranty for which the government has already paid will be null and void.  Since the work required for this contract is directly related to the previous contract under which goods and services were purchased by the government and those services will be adversely effected if another company performs the work exception (11) listed in 5.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) applies in this case.
7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable, and the basis for that determination: 
The costs to the Government is considered fair and reasonable based on Previous purchase of these items and Contracting Officers knowledge.  
8. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition FAR 6.303-2(a) (9)): 
This acquisition in non-Competitive form is advantageous to the government.  It can be implemented on an expedited timeline, without risk to park wide communications and emergency response.  
9. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 
Hi Country Wireless and Telephone, Arvada CO
10. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: 
From the requestor's perspective there are no barriers to overcome in order to make this a non-competitive procurement.  We did not look at other vendors.  Please refer to paragraph (5) for an explanation. 
CERTIFICATIONS: I, hereby, certify that this requirement does not exceed the Government's minimum needs or scheduled requirements, and that the basis for award under other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief:

This is a Sources Sought Notice only and vendors will not be compensated for the information provided. No solicitation will be issued at this time.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems and to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To support this mission, TSA is evaluating Enterprise Vulnerability Scanning System (EVSS) products/solutions that can provide the ability to scan, identify, report, and resolve information technology vulnerabilities across the entire TSA environment. The product/solution should allow authorized users to perform routine and ad-hoc scans across different types of infrastructure, track and report identified vulnerabilities, integrate with Security Information and Event Management tools, and allow TSA leadership access to information as needed. <br /><br />Please provide a detailed description on how the product works and what differentiates it in the Enterprise Vulnerability Scanning market space. Please include at a minimum the following information:<br /><br />&bull; Describe how your product manages and performs Enterprise Vulnerability Scanning across multiple types of information technology systems. Please provide specific information on scanning capabilities for operating systems, databases, software applications, email servers, web applications/web servers/ web services, firewalls, routers, middleware/ Enterprise Service Bus(ESB)/SOA, SaaS/PaaS/IaaS, and any other system/platform that your product can be used to identify and remediate software and system vulnerabilities.<br /><br />&bull; Describe the scanning mechanisms that are used, the typical load that is placed on the target system during scanning, approximate time that scanning takes on a per host/software scan basis, and anticipated network load for scanning activities. Does the scanner have the capability to exploit identified vulnerabilities? Does the scanner operate in an agent or agent-less basis? Does the scanner require a privileged account to operate on the system?</p>
<p>&bull; Describe any mechanisms and product capabilities to identify previously unknown vulnerabilities and 0-day vulnerabilities. Discuss how the product addresses vulnerabilities that have not been previously identified. Does the system have the ability to perform near-real time updates from other product deployments and quickly identify newly found vulnerabilities on TSA systems with the updated information?<br /><br />&bull; Describe mechanisms used to exclude previously identified "false-positive" scan information on periodically recurring scans. Are there any structures in your product to allow for known vulnerability exceptions on a per system basis, or some mechanism to establish an expected baseline configuration?</p>
<p>&bull; Describe any product functionalities that allow the delegation of vulnerability findings to another user who can remediate the vulnerability. Please describe any functions used to manage and control information in the system, and any other options for users to manage/track vulnerability information. Discuss integration options that are available to Change Control Software/Service Tracking packages. Describe any Role Based Access Control (RBAC) structure your product supports.</p>
<p>&bull; Describe any knowledge base that is available for identified vulnerabilities and research of false-positives. Please describe your organizations methodology for incorporating/updating vulnerability information into your scanning tool, the frequency of updates the scanning tool, and the frequency of updates for vulnerability information on your knowledge repositories.</p>
<p>&bull; Describe the reporting functionality that the product provides, and the extent to which it can be customized to provide unique and customizable reports. Describe reporting dashboards that are available for Sr. Management reporting and monitoring.</p>
<p>&bull; Describe authentication and authorization (A&amp;A) mechanisms including Single Sign On and multifactor authentication mechanisms your product supports. Describe any remote access mechanisms that your product provides.</p>

<DESC>Subject:  DMOL3 and the Materials Studio Visualizers Software Maintenance Agreement
Purchase Request Number: 
NB4844080-A-03978
Notice Type: 
Special Notice 
Synopsis: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Optical Technology Division intends to negotiate with Accelrys Software, Inc from San Diego, California on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a single source, to procure a one-year software maintenance agreement contract with Accelrys Software, Inc.
The intention of this procurement is to acquire software maintenance services for DMOL3 and the Materials Studio Visualizers.  DMOL3 software from Accelrys is a program used to perform quantum mechanical calculations using density functional theory on molecules, surfaces, and solids. DMOL3 is also an all electron code, and does not require the use of less accurate pseudo potentials or muffin tins to describe core electrons.  NIST requires that the results be accessible through the Cerius2 and Materials Studio visualizers and interface softwares, which NIST already have in-house.

DMOL3 is NIST primary computational instrument, and have been in use for several years to generate results.  NIST need to be able to compare the numerical results from new calculations with the old DMOL3 results, otherwise NIST have to repeat many years worth of work because of numerical differences between methods 

Based on the above information, Accelrys Software, Inc provides all the services required by NIST which are described below:

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to acquire the processing capability, storage, networking, software, services and facility housing/services in support of operational activities associated with the Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing System (WCOSS) program. The Government intends to negotiate on a competitive basis to acquire two years of service, 01 October 2011 through 30 September 2013, of a total HPC solution that delivers equal or better performance than the existing high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by DOC/NOAA/NWS/NCEP under contract DG133W-02-CN-0013 with IBM Corporation.  The purpose of the bridge contract is to acquire a bridge HPC system that allows the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to support its operational mission for two years while it prepares for a transition to a new HPC system under a new, longer-term contract.  The solicitation for services under the longer-term contract is anticipated to be released in FY2010, concurrently with the solicitation for services under the bridge contract.  The intent is to run parallel operations of the bridge HPC system concurrently with the new HPC system to allow a smooth transition between systems.  The Government may extend the bridge contract solely at its discretion. The Government desires to include small business at either the prime or subcontract level. A description of the current system and the required performance metrics for the bridge system follows.  This synopsis serves to notify the public of the proposed contract action.<br /><br />
<p>The HPC system currently utilized by NCEP directly supports NOAA's strategic goals in Climate, Weather and Water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth's weather, climate and ocean. The existing HPC system was designed by IBM to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but disk storage and tape storage associated with both operational clusters and infrastructure to access supercomputing and tape archive resources associated with a Research and Development (R&amp;D) contract. The current NCEP HPC system consists of two operational supercomputer clusters, Stratus and Cirrus, with identical configurations and a test and evaluation system, Altus. Each operational system is an IBM Power6-based system containing 156 nodes (32 processors per node), 4 GB memory/physical processor and IBM's AIX-based high performance computing parallel environment including GPFS. Each system is capable of delivering 73TF as measured by Linpack benchmark code. Each operational system employs an IBM TS3500 tape library for user data via TSM archival software and network. Each operational system supports a 320 TB disk storage subsystem providing sustained performance of not less than 9 GB/sec for write and 10 GB/s for read. The test and evaluation system is configured using components (hardware and software) identical to the operational systems and consists of a 6-node Power 6 cluster with a 6 TB disk subsystem. IBM provides 7X24X365 system administration and other system related support services via a team comprised of four system administrators servicing Gaithersburg, one system administrator located in Fairmont, WV, one system administrator/software engineer troubleshooting recalcitrant applications/application optimization and one quarter-time software engineer dealing with optimization and meteorological model design.</p>
<p>The operational systems are located in IBM's Business Continuity and Recovery Services facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland and in NASA's Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) facility in Fairmont, West Virginia. The test and evaluation system is located in Gaithersburg. IBM provides its facility as part of its total solution, including all utilities, Uninterruptible Power Supply, backup electrical generators (sufficient to provide "N+1" redundancy), all associated facility infrastructure (such as electrical switch gear, water-cooling plumbing, etc.) and 7X24X365 support sufficient to meet NCEP's on-time requirements. Gaithersburg lies within the Washington, DC metro area Federal communications cloud, thereby lowering communications costs.</p>
<p>The bridge HPC system must provide a continuation of operational performance at least equivalent to Stratus and Cirrus, including support of the IBM GPFS parallel filesystem. It must meet NCEP's strict dependability guaranteed performance of 99% operational use time, 99% on-time product generation and system switch (between Stratus and Cirrus or vice versa) of 30 minutes. The bridge system must also provide an equivalent test and evaluation system.</p>
<p>The HPC systems must be fully supported by system administrators and maintenance provided on a 7X24x365 basis. The HPC system must continue to support full integration with the existing R&amp;D computing and HPSS tape archival system. In addition, the HPC system must be integrated into NCEP's local area network and NCEP's wide area network, supported by industry standard communications hardware/software. Both Verizon and Quest have points of presence within the Gaithersburg and Fairmont facilities.</p>
<p>The estimated budget for this requirement is $39 Million. NOAA anticipates leasing the hardware, software and services to include maintenance (7X24X365) under fixed-price terms. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a production-ready system.  A production-ready system is one capable of meeting the previously cited requirements and a facility to support that system. Seamless integration of the HPC system into the existing infrastructure is required. Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of system transition and integration with zero disruption of NCEP's operational Weather and Climate forecasting activities. Vendors must include in their response an explanation, in detail, of its plan to transition, implement and manage integration with the existing HPC and communications systems. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Responses must be submitted by e-mail to the following address: richard.parkerson@noaa.gov with RFI-NCEP2010 noted in the subject header. Affirmative responses must be received by 12:00PM EST on 01 April 2010.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for a Request for Information only and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to purchase or acquire systems or services.  The Government will not pay for data or time expended on this RFI and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request.  This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with Sybase, Inc. for renewal of annual maintenance and support for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) software products.  Sybase, Inc. is the only source that has been identified as capable of satisfying the SECs requirement.  The majority of the SEC's most critical enterprise applications, such as EDGAR, NRSI and HUB are built on the Sybase ASE DBMS.  Therefore, Sybase maintenance is needed.  Due to licensing, warranty, and compatibility issues, it is not possible for another source to meet the SECs requirement.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The SEC intends to award a contract to Sybase, Inc. on or about March 8, 2010. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals.  A competitive solicitation will not be issued.  However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-10-AA06 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAICS is 334516, business size is 500 employees. This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.
<p>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has need to lease with option to purchase an Automated Discrete Analyzer.</p>
<p>The following will detail the specific requirements.<br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The automated discrete analyzer will be used to automate and standardize various chemical tests we run on soil and plant materials. These assays currently require an enormous amount of technician time and throughput is impeded by the necessity to stop and regenerate enough glassware to continue our "macro" methods. The equipment will also allow miniaturization of the assays for nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate that will greatly reduce the amount of chemical waste produced from the methods currently used. Technician time devoted to those assays will also be greatly reduced, and reproducibility of results will also improve. In addition, the equipment eliminates the currently used Kjeldahl method which is hazardous.</p>
<p><strong>Technical specifications for an automated discrete analyzer:</strong> (1) detect ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and ortho-phospate in diverse soil and plant extract matrices. (2) quantify analytes with at least low ppm concentrations. (3) operate over a wide dynamic range (wide linear response). (4) automatically detect over-range samples, dilute, and re-run. (5) utilize microliter amounts of reagents (minimizing wastes). (6) utilize non-hazardous reagents where feasible. (7) generate auditable calibrations; generate reports in Excel, text, and common LIMS formats. (8) allow development of novel analyses. (9) user-friendly software for calibration, monitoring sample processing, and troubleshooting malfunctions. (10) minimize cost of consumables. (11) operate reliably with minimal intervention. (12) Maintenance Agreement. (13) Delivery, set-up and training.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong><br />Base Year: April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011<br />Option Year 1: April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012<br />Option Year 2: April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013<br />Option Year 3: April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014<br />Purchase price at the end of lease.<br /><br /><strong>Please price the base and option years as separate line items. The Government prefers to pay quarterly in arrears but monthly is acceptable, please specify in your proposal. Please include maintenance agreement in the price of the lease.</strong> Contractor shall furnish, deliver and set-up the Automated Discrete Analyzer to the USDA, ARS, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, 2413 East Business Highway 83, Weslaco, Texas 78596. Include literature sufficient to determine conformance of the instrument to meet or exceed the technical requirements.

In order to be considered for award offerors shall provide a quotation on company letterhead and include with the bid schedule detailing the unit pricing and references for the proposed item. References must have received the proposed item within the last three calendar years (Government references preferred but will accept commercial references) shall also be provided for the item quoted.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma, intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the acquisition of material listed below. THIS ACQUISITION IS A SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT.</p>
<p>Proposal Submission Information:<br />Quotations are due by 08 March 2010, 12:00 pm, Tinker AFB OK Central Standard Time (CST). Contact the following individual for information regarding this solicitation: <br />NOTE: Emailed proposals are preferred<br />Jason Shirazi<br />Contracting Specialist<br />Jason.Shirazi@tinker.af.mil<br />Facsimile proposals will be accepted at (405) 734-1142</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF RESPONSES:<br />Award will be conducted and evaluated under the provisions of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The responsible offerors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) database (available at: http://orca.bpn.gov/) system per FAR 52.212-3, and submit a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quote. Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1. Lack of registration in CCR will qualify contractor as ineligible for award. All responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to this solicitation, which shall be considered. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), for a firm fixed type contract. The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (best value).</p>
<p>Number of Contracts to be Awarded <br />The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals/quotes and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>FBO Note 22 Applies:</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Phillip  Harrell, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-8635, Fax 410-786-9088, Email phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov - Louis P. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-5564, Email Louis.Anderson@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><br />The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), intends to award under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a sole source purchase order to Comanche Nation, 584 NW Bingo Road, Lawton, OK 733507-1214 for the following services, under NAICS Code 921150. The purpose of this effort is to award a purchase order to a Tribal College and University (TCU) to provide a 12-month training program that will lead to the certification of new health insurance billing coders and re-certification of existing billing coders. As part of this initiative, CNC will provide necessary outreach to enroll students in the program, and identify their individual coding skills as advanced, intermediate or beginner. Individuals to be targeted for the outreach and training are those who work for tribal providers as billing coders or perform related tasks. This training is necessary to meet the demand for coding services created by the growing utilization of Medicare and Medicaid programs in tribal communities and the ongoing policy and procedural changes made in these programs that impact payment and billing practices. The TCU will provide students skills in ICD9 and CPT4 coding to achieve certification through one of the billing coding certification entities such as the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC). The TCU will also be available to conduct training to permit existing coders to maintain certification by providing the latest information on procedural and policy changes and the concepts of the ICD10 coding system. By making adequately trained billing coders available, CMS will contribute to improving timeliness of payments to HIS and tribal providers and assuring that payment is made for all the covered services they provide. These improvements will allow fledgling Indian Health Services (IHS) and tribal providers in rural, remote and frontier areas to have funding available to maintain health care services needed by their patients. While IHS providers are also in need of this training, this effort will focus on tribal providers for two reasons: (1) IHS has an existing training program for its providers and (2) the number of tribal providers is increasing sharply as more tribes use the authorities available to them to operate their own programs. Interested students who are neither employees of a tribal provider nor HIS employees can also participate in the training. This procurement should be awarded to the Comanche Nation because no other sources will satisfy agency requirements given the unique nature of the Presidential Executive Order requiring Federal agencies to assist TCUs in accessing Federal resources. This purchase order will focus upon establishing and continuing a program to train billing coders within tribal communities using TCU and tribal resources within those communities. CN is the most capable of providing these trainings in these communities given that many of the tribal colleges are very small institutions and do not have sufficient staff support to meet the demands of a project such as this without extensive startup funding. CN has a proven track record of success with CMS of conducting such training and effectively using its current administrative capacity. One of the critical factors in this training program is acquiring an adequate number of students in order to institute the training program. Because CN is located in Oklahoma, where the largest number of tribes in the continental United States is located, it has access to a large potential student pool necessary for this effort. CN also has strong relations with other tribal colleges located in Oklahoma and can thus make arrangements to train students at other locations other than on the main campus of the college while at the same time remaining firmly within the tribal community. Additionally, CN has proven access to staff trained in the provision of billing coding with an emphasis on CMS issues. All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency. Expression of interest and statement of capabilities must be emailed to Phillip.Harrell@cms.hhs.gov. Statement of capabilities must be received within 5 days from the published date of this notice. In addition, all interested contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at the following website: http://www.ccr.gov. <br />

<p>Environmental Compliance. Offerors are reminded of the environmental requirements contained in the solicitation to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental statutes and regulations. In addition to the scrutiny of civil environmental regulatory and enforcement agencies, environmental compliance incidental to Air Force activities or on Air Force property is subject to Air Force scrutiny. The Air Force routinely investigates environmental violations and cooperates fully with civil authorities to secure remedies and discourage future violations. Failure to comply with environmental statutes and regulations can subject the contractor to criminal and civil penalties and/or contractual sanctions including, but not limited to, termination, suspension, and debarment, and adverse past performance assessment. Contractors can obtain specific information regarding environmental compliance mandates in 316 WG/CC Memo "Andrews AFB Environmental Standards" dated 19 Oct 2006. Additional information can be obtained by contacting the base environmental flight.</p>
<p>316 CONS-007<br />PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />AFI 31-501 (27 Jan 2005)<br />The contractor shall not employ any person for work on this contract if such employee is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the installation and its population, nor shall the contractor employ any person under this contract who has an outstanding criminal warrant as identified by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). NCIC checks will verify if a person is wanted by local, state, and federal agencies. All contractor personnel must consent to NCIC background checks. Contractor personnel who do not consent to an NCIC check will be denied access to the installation. Information required to conduct an NCIC check includes: full name, driver's license number/state issued/expiration date, social security number, and date of birth of the person entering the installation and shall be submitted in conjunction with the contractor's request for vehicle passes. Completion of a successful NCIC check does not invalidate the requirement for an escort when contractor personnel are working within controlled or restricted areas.<br />Contractors shall ensure their employees and those of their subcontracts have the proper credentials allowing them to work in the United States. Persons later found to be undocumented or illegal aliens will be remanded to the proper authorities.<br />The contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation for delays or expenses associated with complying with the provisions of this clause. Furthermore, nothing in this clause shall excuse the contractor from proceeding with the contract as required. The contractor shall flow this clause down to all subcontracts.<br />5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Diane Dade, AFDW/SB, 1535 Command Drive Suite E-210, Andrews AFB, MD (301) 981-7342, fax (301) 981-6538, email: Diane.Dade@afncr.af.mil . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332313 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***


*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase Flexible Borated Shielding. ***

Background:  The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  A large portion of the design effort centers on the placement of neutron and gamma ray shielding such that unwanted radiation doesnt interfere with personal safety, degrade the quality of data gathered, or cause damage to equipment and instrumentation.  A typical shielding arrangement is a matrix of various materials, chosen for the way that the various forms of incident radiation react upon contact or penetration.  

One form of radiation requiring attenuation is thermal neutrons.  These can be absorbed by 10B, an isotope of boron that represents about 20 percent of the atoms in naturally occurring boron.  The challenge in using 10B (a powder) is in achieving a uniform areal density surrounding the thermal neutron radiation field.  Placing the powder in metal canisters is very costly, engineering intensive and subject to settling due to gravity (and leaving an open pathway for thermal neutrons).  Mixing the boron in epoxy has met with limited success, but the epoxy can be difficult to cast into the appropriate shapes and is susceptible to radiation damage.

In the last 10 years, the NCNR has had success using a flexible polymer matrix containing boron that has been enriched to give a high percentage of the 10B isotope.  The flexible polymer matrix provides an excellent method for placing 10B where it is needed without causing secondary radiation problems and provides a uniform dispersion of the 10B atoms.  Additionally, the material can be cut to size easily with shears.

This product (borated shielding) may also be referred to as boronated shielding, particularly outside of the United States.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Flexible Borated Shielding, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

(see attachment for specifications.)

FOB Destination delivery terms are requested.  FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

 Under the technical capability factor, stronger consideration will be given to a quoted product that includes the following:  higher attenuation factors; longer lengths.

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all technical requirements, and clearly documents that the offered product meets the technical requirements stated above.

<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to subscribe to a content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>

<p>(i) Technical capability <br />(ii) Past performance<br />(iii) Price</p>

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov.

Offerors are required to submit on-line Reps & Certs (see https://orca.bpn.gov/).  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation:   52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008).  The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:

Note 1:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:

1)  FACTOR 1:  Technical Capability - The offeror shall submit the following information for technical evaluation:

a) Describe your technical approach for satisfying the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Seminars A and B, including any topics that you intend to address in each seminar that are in addition to those required by the PWS. 

b) Describe how you will recruit and hire qualified seminar instructors.  Resumes shall be submitted for project manager, alternate project manager, seminar instructors and any proposed alternates.

2)  FACTOR 2:  Relevant Past Performance - past performance information shall include at least three references to support the proposal to include contract number, type, value, description, contracting officer and technical points of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers.  Past performance will be evaluated for relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

2100 2ND Street, SW STOP 7112

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008). 1. Parties responding to this solicitation who believe they can provide this requirement, may submit their offer in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g. on company letterhead, formal quote form, etc.) but must include the following information: 1) companys complete mailing and remittance addresses, 2) discounts for prompt payment if applicable 3) cage code, 4) Dun & Bradstreet number, 5) Taxpayer ID number. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009) with their offer. 


(viii) 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  This is a commercial item acquisition. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 13.106 apply. 
The award will be made to the responsible offeror  whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most  advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

1.	 The directory of companies that have achieved registration and/or ISO 9001:2008 after being audited by the prospective registrar.  Describe the type of industry categories these companies belong to; an evaluation will be made to determine whether these companies are in the ship repair industry.   

2.	Based on the resume and experience of the Lead Auditor, a rating will be determined regarding the working knowledge of the Lead Auditor of the ship repair industry (other than CG YARD).  This is a critical element for this contract because the lead Auditor needs to be able to evaluate the Quality Management System (QMS) at the CG YARD with similar facilities in the ship repair industry.

3.	The prospective Audit Team must be able to function safely in a heavy industrial situation when interviewing all levels of the CG YARD personnel to determine implementation of the QMS.  Familiarity with personal protective equipment is crucial and interviewing of employees must be done on the work site only when it does not interfere with production.  Describe for us the policy for interviewing our employees and the Audit Teams knowledge of the use of personal protective equipment.

4.	The contractor will provide a tentative audit schedule at leas 30 days prior to the start of each audit (one re-certification and five surveillance) that specifies particular members of management to be interviewed and wheat functional shop areas are to be audited.  The CG YARD will be given an opportunity to suggest the tentative schedule.  Provide an example of a tentative schedule for review.

5.	The Lead Auditor will conduct an opening meeting and closing meeting for the CG YARDs Top Management to summarize audit results, note difficulties, and give a draft report with recommendations for the continued certification.  Provide an outline of typical opening/closing meetings.

6.	The contractor shall have a multi-layered appeals system system through which the CG YARD may appeal any ruling, determination, or action of the Contractor relating to the auditing and registration processes.  Explain how the appeals process works including how long each step should take.

7.	Corroboration that contractor is a Registrar accredited through the American National Accreditation Program for Registrars of  Quality Management Systems as administered by the American national Standards Institute ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANSI-ANAB).  The scope of this accreditation shall include North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 92811, 336611, and 336612 for ship and boat building repair.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(3) "Domestic end product" means--</p>
<p>(i) An unmanufactured end product that has been mined or produced in the United States; or</p>

The cost of components includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that--</p>
<p>(1) Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or</p>
<p>(2) It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act; or</p>

<p>(A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.</p>
<p>(B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(9) "South Caucasus/Central and South Asian (SC/CASA) state" means Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, or Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end products in the Buy American Act--Balance of Payments Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(d) The contract price does not include duty for end products or components for which the Contractor will claim duty-free entry.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>A. Place of Delivery</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to subscribe to a content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>
<p>C. Online Subscription Requirements</p>
<p>1.

<p>2.2 The contractor shall provide a product to allow the government to use data provided as well as directly copy and promulgate this data to the NBIS federal partners.</p>
<p>2.3 The contractor shall provide a product via the RSS feed through the World Wide Web <br /><br />2.4 The contractor shall provide a product to allow simultaneous use of the system by three (3 or more) NBIC staff members.</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability <br />(ii) Past performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>The technical evaluation factors (technical capability and past performance) are approximately equal in importance. The technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The basis of award will be a best value tradeoff determination.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to subscribe to a content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>

<p>The technical evaluation factors (technical capability and past performance) are approximately equal in importance. The technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The basis of award will be a best value tradeoff determination.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

<p>III. Description of Requirements</p>
<p>A. Place of Delivery</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to receive content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements in order to test and evaluate the suitability and applicability of a content aggregator's compatibility with the NBIC.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>

<p>4. 3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest. (JUN 2006)<br />(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage.

<p><br />VI. Evaluation</p>
<p>A. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition as described below:</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability <br />(ii) Past performance<br />(iii) Small Business (SB) participation <br />(ii) Price</p>
<p>The technical evaluation factors: The evaluation criteria are stated in descending order of relative importance. When combined, technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than Price, which is non-rated. As the overall rating of technical criteria among quotations tends toward equality, price becomes more important in making the award determination. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that paying a price premium is warranted due to the evaluation of technical criteria. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that paying a price premium is not warranted. While price is not a rated criterion, it is significant.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>
<p>VII. List of attachments<br />A. Attachment one: FAR 52.212-3 incorporated in full text. <br />B. Attachment two: Past Performance survey. <br />C. Attachment three: Small business participation</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis of a requirement in support of the National Guard. This is not a solicitation. A complete RFP package will be available approximately on or about 19 March 2010.
The acquisition is being managed by the US Department of Interior (DOI) / National Business Center (NBC) / Acquisition Services Directorate Herndon (AQD-Herndon) as a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act to provide acquisition services to all Federal and DoD Agencies.  
The National Guard
The mission of the National Guard (NG) is to serve as part of the first-line defense for the United States. Additionally the NG may be called up for active duty in response to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. 
The NG represents a unique and complex organizational and operational environment.  Organizationally, the NG comprises various organizational entities including: the National Guard Bureau (NGB); Army National Guard, (ARNG); Air National Guard (ANG); and various directorates. There are NG entities located in 54 states and territories. Potential users for this requirement include the previously described NG organizational entities, as well as other DoD communities, Federal Civil Agencies, and States and Territories. NG entities requiring support are in CONUS and potentially in OCONUS locations. 
Description
This is a requirement for a broad range of functional support services for current and future acquisition and program initiatives in behalf of the NG in the following functional areas. 
"	Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) / Program Management Office (PMO);"	Acquisition Support; and"	Technology.
The solicitation calls for a single award Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for services for five years. Although the Government intends to make a single award, it reserves the right to make multiple awards if it's in the best interest of the Government. The limits on this IDIQ are: the minimum for the entire IDIQ contract is $100,000; and the maximum over the five year period for the entire IDIQ contract is $45 million. 
The NG requires a broad range of independent, objective, conflict of interest free functional support for current and future acquisition and program initiatives. Although the NG has growing needs in these functional areas, it has limited resources to meet programmatic demands. Moreover, the exact timing, amount and size of its future requirements for support in these areas over the next five years will not be known at the time of contract award.  As a result, the NG requires flexibility in scheduling and ordering services as the exact requirements arise. However, it is inadvisable for the NG to commit itself for more than the minimum quantity.  
In order to obtain future support in these functional areas and given its constraints in defining its exact requirements and its timing for the requirements, the Government intends to issue a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract based on the solicitation to the Contractor who can provide the NG with the expert resources and rapid solutions to address its needs over a five year period with a commitment to long term excellence. Although the Government intends to make a single award, it reserves the right to make multiple awards if it's in the best interest of the Government.  Performance based task order requirements from NG entities will be provided to the Contractor in Task Order Requirement Packages (TORPs) to meet programmatic requirements as they arise.
Contractor Facilities / Primary Work Location
The Contractor shall perform the predominant amount of work for this contract at the Contractor's own facilities which shall be located in the National Capital Region (NCR) Washington metropolitan area, in order to facilitate interaction with requiring NG entities primarily located in the NCR area. Further, the intent of this requirement is for the Contractor to provide IV&V and Acquisition Support for NG entities which are located within the NCR and not outside the NCR. However, there may be some requirements for travel to locations throughout the United States for short durations. Government furnished space for the purposes of meeting the requirements in this PWS is at a premium. Government furnished space will be provided only on a case by case exception basis.  
Additionally, the Contractor must provide an appropriately equipped secure facility available as needed on demand in the Washington DC metropolitan area for Acquisition Support related source selection activities such as proposal evaluations, since the NG has limited facilities of its own to conduct extended source selections. Similarly, the Contractor must provide facilities to host weekly In Process Review (IPR) meetings. 
Integrated Support
The Contractor must demonstrate the technical and management expertise to provide seamless integrated support across different functional areas, since NG customers may require support from more than one functional area on any given project, and the functional areas have activities which overlap each other. Stove piped solutions which are narrowly focused on staffing solutions or merely supplying labor categories to meet the NG's functional needs, e.g. IV&V, PMO, and Acquisition Support, are not responsive to the requirement. The Contractor must be structurally aligned to provide timely, disciplined, methodical, and comprehensive cross domain integrated expert professional services support with Reach Back capabilities, and a commitment to long term excellence and maximizing quality, efficiency and productivity.
The Contractor must have an enterprise strategy for providing a broad spectrum of integrated professional services in these functional areas for any or all phases of a program's individual lifecycle. An integrated mix of services, tools and expertise is required to support cross domain activities and operate in a collaborative and integrated environment. Individual task orders written against the IDIQ will require the Contractor to provide support that is integrated and spans across different functional areas. 
Disciplined, comprehensive, established and analytical methodologies for providing functional support in these areas are required. Formalized knowledge and experience in applying cutting edge technology and methods to Government program needs, in order to maximize quality, efficiency, productivity are required. The Contractor must demonstrate program rigor which reflects experience, professional certifications, national security clearances, appropriate tools and knowledge of industry standards and best practices. Capabilities for functional support must be deep and broad in each domain. 
Additionally, the Contractor must demonstrate Reach Back capabilities including a process and structure for the systematic, coordinated, flexible, short notice, and effective delivery of additional resources and subject matter expertise in meeting PWS requirements and solving complex problems.
Required Plans
The Contractor must provide and implement the following plans and / or processes.
"	A Small Business Subcontracting Plan which conforms to the requirements of FAR subpart 19.7 unless otherwise exempted pursuant to FAR 19.702(b) (1). "	A robust and proactive Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) plan in order to maintain a position of trust, confidence, and integrity with the Government."	An Information Security Plan, Quality Control Plan, and a Security Plan, as described in the PWS.
Subcontracting
The Government will evaluate the offeror's subcontracting plan for meeting DoD small business subcontracting goals listed below, as well as compliance with the requirements of FAR Part 19.7. For purposed of evaluation, these subcontracting goals pertain to the total dollars subcontracted in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  DoD subcontracting goals are as follows.
"	Small Business (SB) 37%"	HUBZone (HUBZ)  3%"	Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) 3%"	Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 5%"	Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) 5%"	Historically Black colleges & Universities and Minority Institutions 5%
Additionally, The Government will consider the offeror's subcontracting management plan to include teaming arrangements and processes for managing and monitoring of subcontractors. The Government will also consider the effectiveness of the offeror's abilities to meet their prior subcontracting goals.  
The Government will consider the flexibility required by the offeror for developing a subcontracting plan for this IDIQ contract, given that the timing and size of future task orders are indefinite, and the Government cannot commit to more than a guaranteed minimum ordering quantity, and there is a period of performance of up to five years.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   NAICS Code: 83920, the purpose of this amendment is to provide answers in response to the questions received regarding the RFQ.
Question #1: Performance Objective 7 states that training should be made available to all laboratory staff members.   Can you provide any general information about the number of staff expected to attend each session?
Answer:  BEAD anticipates an average class size of 20 staff members for each of the three separate lab training sessions.
Question #2: Do all three of the Labs follow the same Quality System, excluding technical Standard Operating Procedures?
Answer:  Yes, the laboratories are all subject to the Biological and Economic Analysis Division's overarching Quality System as outlined in the Quality Management Plan (QMP); however, each laboratory also documents and maintains its own Quality Management Plan, which is contained in the Division's QMP appendix.

<DESC>The solicitation no longer accurately reflects the Government's requirements in light of market conditions. Cancellation, instead of the issuance of an amendment to this solicitation, is appropriate because an amendment would preclude from participation in the procurement those sources who likely would have participated in the procurement had the substance of the amendment been known to them.

SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: SEE SUBCONTRACTING GOALS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN. 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), renamed by Executive Order in 1999, is located in Washington DCs Presidential Park, immediately west of The White House. This National Historic Landmark (NHL) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, the EEOB was built between 1871-1888 to house the growing staff of the Departments of State, War, and Navy, and is considered among the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. Restoration of interior building spaces began in 1983. Since then, main corridors, libraries, stairwell domes, stained glass rotundas, and certain offices have been restored. Originally known as the State, War, and Navy Building, the EEOB housed the three departments associated with formulating and conducting the nations foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century  the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed many of the nations most significant diplomats, politicians and military leaders and has been the scene of many historic events. 

Due to its proximity to the White House, the EEOB houses a majority of the White House Staff offices.  The building houses the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, White House Counsel, and numerous other offices critical to the Presidential Administration. The EEOB is currently undergoing a 3 phased multi-year modernization and security upgrade. As the modernizations programmatic requirements evolved, it became clear that a new ADA compliant security screening facility and entrance was needed for employees, guests, and dignitaries. However, the exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project are still under discussion and exploration. The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on government estimates and projections.  GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the constraints of this project, its complex environment, historic preservation requirements, and the potential impact on contributing historical resources, GSA will require the services of our nations most talented lead designer for performance of architectural bridging design document services.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural bridging design document services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.

The proposed facility will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by EOP OA and USSS UD, the design of the facility and site must meet stringent federal security requirements. The screening facility will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The White House Security Guidelines and the United States Secret Services Technical Security Division have determined the classification level for this project. All judgments and proposed amendments to stated classification determinations must be presented to and approved by the United States Secret Service and White House Security.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

The project may provide approximately 800 GSF of new construction and adaptation of a National Historic Landmark. The intent of this project is to serve the needs of tenant agencies by providing a new ADA compliant building access and security screening facility. The new facility will function as a screening, credentialing, and holding area for employees, guests, and dignitaries wishing to gain entrance to the EEOB. A satisfactory outcome will meet tenant agency requirements with new construction that relates successfully to the surrounding urban landscape, architecture and historical context. The scope of architectural bridging design documents services will include: architecture; civil; historical preservation; interior design; urban site and landscape design; and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. Due to the sensitive nature of the proposed facilitys location and function, this Design Excellence opportunity will ONLY ADDRESS THE ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT of the facility. These Design Excellence architectural bridging design documents shall be categorized as Sensitive but Unclassified.   
(AMENDED 7 May 2009) All mechanical, electrical, plumbing, communications, IT, security, fire protection, physical security, and all other sensitive components of the facility will be integrated into the bridging design documents by the subsequent design-build firm, which is already under current contract with the Government.  Therefore the subsequent design-build firm, which holds proper facility clearances and the existing design contract with the government, will be utilized as an advisor for any coordination or implementation issues during the architectural bridging document development that involve classified systems or details. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 

(AMENDED 7 May 2009) The goals for this procurement are as follows: complete a client program evaluation defining the project and programmatic requirements and provide architectural bridging design document services. The design-build contractor, already under current contract with the Government, will use the architectural bridging documents as bases for a full design. This procurement is to address the architectural bridging design only and will not address classified systems, components, or processes. 

All conceptual/bridging design work will be required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation. Design submissions will include: an illustrated preservation report identifying all relevant design details, potential conflicts with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards and solutions for preventing all adverse effects, as defined in the NHPA, while achieving project goals. The Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO) must evaluate each design concept for compliance with all applicable preservation standards. The RHPO may request and coordinate additional design reviews based on their interpretation of each design submission. The lead designer and A/E team will 1. Participate in design consultations and presentations for project approvals by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA); 2. Fully engage tenants in the planning and design of the screening facility and its thoughtful integration into the EEOB, its historic landscape and urban context- the Presidential Park precinct; 3. Develop an architectural bridging design that maintains and enhances the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; 4. Balance historic preservation with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting, and 5. Respect, incorporate, and interpret the significance of the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildings past, and that of Pennsylvania Avenue; 6. Subscribe to the Design Excellence goals; 7. Produce an architectural bridging design capable of achieving a level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet or exceed the United States Green Building Councils (USGBC) Silver LEED rating; 8. Plan and design to promote reciprocal natural views and sightlines from Pennsylvania Avenue to the EEOB; 9. Engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities which will accomplish preservation of adjacent historic setting and urban context and 10. Integrate basic operational and physical security elements within the Presidential Park precinct.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JOB Description: <br />The job site is located at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Coyote Valley Dam / Lake Mendocino Project Headquarters, approximately 5 miles north of the city of Ukiah (1160 Lake Mendocino Drive, Ukiah, California, 95482) and 3 miles from State Highway 101.</p>
<p>Proposed work consists of furnishing all labor, materials, and equipment to renovate Building #2, upgrading it from its present state to a multi-purpose office. Building #2 shall be renovated to include a Conference Room, Kitchen, Dining Area, Filing Storage Room and Men's &amp; Women's Restrooms. The Government has already purchased some necessary materials for the project's completion. The Contractor shall verify the govt-supplied materials and furnish the remaining necessary materials to perform this project. <br />Building # 2 was originally constructed to serve as a concrete and soils testing laboratory, as well as a survey office, during the construction of Coyote Valley Dam (CVD) and appurtenances. Following completion of the dam in the late 1950's, the building was converted into a wood shop and storage facility. The wood-framed single-story structure has a total floor area of approximately 2,850 feet. Floors are concrete slab type, ceilings are vaulted, and interior walls are generally covered with sheetrock or plywood, if not exposed to studs. The roof is covered with composition type rolled roofing overlaying plywood sheeting, purlins and insulating fiberboard. Currently, Building # 2 is used as an alternate make-shift conference area, as well as exercise and storage facility. The Project's main building (Building 1) houses the main conference room (also serves as lunch room) which is extremely undersized. Building #2 contains women's and men's restrooms which are in various stages of renovation. In 2009, project staff remodeled approximately 368 feet of floor space to construct a new exercise room. Hence, this area shall not be included in the new proposed work.</p>

THOSE CONTRACTORS THAT FAILED TO PROVIDE ALL THE REQUESTED ITEMS, ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR ADDRESSING THE REQUIRED CAPABILITY TO HANDLE MULTIPLE BURNS WERE NOT CONSIDERED OR RATED LOWER. THOSE FAILING TO HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE WITH PILE BURNING WERE ALSO RATED LOWER. THE SIZE AND MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROJECT REQUIRES EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITY AND IF MULTIPLE PILES BEING BURNED ARE NOT PROPERLY CONTROLLED IT COULD RESULT IN A HAZARDOUS SITUATION FOR THE FOREST SERVICE. THIS RISK WAS CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ04UA00006.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the MINACT, Inc. under contract number DOLJ04UA00006.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $223,456 to the Finch-Henry Job Corps Center, operated by MINACT, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.  Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.

The funding is intended to address the following Green Equipment Initiative Projects: Plumbing in dormitories/recreation area - replace with low flow fixtures; Install motion detector lighting; Replace washers/dryers with energy efficient models; Replace stove in Cafeteria and Culinary Arts classroom with energy efficient models; and new energy efficient dishwasher.  The operator of the Finch-Henry Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.    

This modification has been awarded on March 1, 2010.
