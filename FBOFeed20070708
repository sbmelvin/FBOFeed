<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to Allentown Caging Equipment Co. Allentown, NJ 08501. 

FDA will purchase:  2 each, MDJ7140MVSPCD3-3X 140 Cage Micro-Vent Units; 10 cases, PC75JMVCD-Changeout Cages; 10 cases, PC75JMVSH-Changeout Cages; 4 each, MS10196U36MFPSH-1X Micro-Flo Environmental System; 20 each, RB272718CPG-Plastic Rabbit Cage; 20 each, RB5PAN-Plastic Rabbit Pan; 1 each, XS260-X-Xenopus Rack. 

This equipment will be added to existing equipment manufactured by the contractor and will increase the holding capacity at the animal facilities at FDA.  Purchasing similar types of equipment will pose several problems for the consistency, efficiency, economy and operation of the animal facility. This equipment also maximizes storage options, uniformity of the cage types and reduces the risk of animal caging being interchanged between the various types of automatic watering apparatus. 

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the seventh (7th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.
 
All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Harry.BrubakerIII@fda.hhs.gov. No phone calls will be accepted. An award will be made in fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. The non-competitive award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>HQ Air Education and Training Command (HQ/AETC), Office of the Air Force Surgeon General (SGPM) has a requirement for a software license agreement for Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical 9.0, along with technical support, upgrades, and on-site training. Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical Version 9 is the only voice recognition software approved by the DoD electronic health record (AHLTA) Program Office.  This voice recognition software enables medical providers to dictate directly into medical forms (templates) which are set up around their medical expertise.  These templates are saved directly into the electronic health record. Dragon Naturally Speaking is the only manufacturer that met the needs of the government and was approved for use by AHLTA.  The acquisition of a different product would be incompatible with this system and the costs for testing, evaluation and approval would not be cost-effective for the Air Force. Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical 9.0 licenses can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) IV contracting system as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 13, 2007. Third party firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the Government will avoid additional cost of ownership and production will not be affected if non-Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical 9.0 software is purchased. The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to Allison.Cox-Rudick@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

<DESC>Food Preservation by Ultrasound

Please note:  In order to conduct research on Food Preservation by Ultrasound and replicate the work being conducted on this topic, the FDA will need both bench and pilot plant scale Ultrasound equipment, which are similar to those being used in academia and industry. Having the equipment from the same manufacture will allow us to determine if the engineering parameters and results from a bench system can be scaled up to the pilot plant or small industrial size system. 

Intent to Sole Source:  Other competition not acceptable.

Minimum Technical Requirements:


A.  General Minimum Technical Requirements for both instruments
1. Ultrasonic equipment must have automatic resonance frequency tracking.  Ultrasonic equipment re-scans every 0.1 of a second to find the new resonance frequency in case there are any changes in process condition such as temperature, pressure, viscosity, gas/air entrainment. 

2.  Ultrasonic equipment must have built-in sensors to report any change in process condition to the generator so that the system never overloads and breaks down.  The optimum resonance frequency allows you to work/operate at 85% energy efficiency. (?) Any deviation away from the optimum resonance frequency will mean a significant power drop off.

3.  All food contact surface materials must be food-grade.

4.  For applications such as agricultural washing/sanitization and in line microbial destruction for food preservation, Sonotrode must be radial design.

5.  The standard accessories must allow for amplitudes of up to 170 micron, pressures of up to 10 bars, flow rates of up to 10L/min, (depending on the process) temperatures of up to 80 deg C and viscosity of up to 100.000cP.

6. Ultrasonic equipment must be currently being used, or similar to that being used by academia and industry to conduct research on this topic.  Ultrasonic equipment must have PC control, which facilitates the recording of the individual trials. Ultrasonic equipment results are reproducibility and linear scalability of the engineering parameters.
