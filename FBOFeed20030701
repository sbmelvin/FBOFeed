<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 14-3K47-03, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14. The NAICS code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition will be procured on an unrestricted basis.  The Government intends to negotiate non-competitively with Agencourt, 100 Cummings Center Suite 107J, Beverly, MA 01915, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by one responsible source.  FAR Subpart 6.3.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency. Your responses/quotes shall include literature, brochures and other such information in order to determine the ability to meet the  stated capabilities.  The Government will award a firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. This requirement is for a suite of custom services to generate 50,000 expressed sequence tags from two normalized cDNA libraries.  The MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS are:  These services include mRNA extraction from frozen tissues, cDNA library construction, library normalization, arraying of library clones, plasmid isolation of arrayed clones, and two-pass sequencing of each plasmid isolate. Specifically, the cDNA library normalization service must produce two Cot-500 libraries of low clonal redundancy from mRNA pools that are derived from eight different bovine gut tissues. Equimolar amounts of cytoplasmic RNA from these tissues will be used to generate two RNA pools for cDNA synthesis. This synthesis must produce >1 kb cDNA fragments using lock-down oligo dT primers, and the cDNA must be enriched for full-length clones (>60%) corresponding to the 5'-end of the transcript. We require these cDNAs fragments be directionally cloned into an expression vector with sites for annealing of M13 primers and transformed into DH10B cells. Two libraries should be produced in this manner; each with >1 x 107 primary clones. The level of normalization to produce the final libraries must be Cot-500 with each library containing a minimum of 0.5 x 107 unique clones and an average insert size >1 kb. All steps used to produce this cDNA library must be assured by a quality control processes. All residual materials need to be returned to our laboratory. Once the libraries are completed, clones must be plated for arraying into growth plates that will be used for archiving in glycerol and plasmid preparation. Plasmid purification, sequencing reaction set-up, and sequencing reaction clean-up are completely automated to minimize the possibility of technician error and decrease sample to sample variability. Enough plasmid must be isolated to generate a 5' and 3' sequencing reads from each clone with residual plasmid left for archiving. A total of 50,000 EST must be produced using an ABI Prism™ 3700/3730xl. Sequencing criteria include a >80% success rate/sequencing reaction for producing Phred20 over 400 consecutive nucleotides. Samples must be tracked from project start to finish on a well by well basis, and must be accessible in real-time. Data must be held in a secure database until accessed by secure FTP. This includes virus protection, e-mail encryption, multiple firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure VPN technology, fingerprint scanners, and multiple tape storage systems to manage data security. Sequencing of 50,000 EST must be concluded within two months from start of plasmid isolation.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a five-year contract for its Rule of Law (ROL) program in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).

The JSDP focuses on building the capacity and sustainability of key local institutions to ensure that Bosnians have access to an efficient and reliable justice system long after the International Community (IC) has ended its presence in the country. It also seeks to promote the more uniform application of the law in the territory of BiH, which, under the Dayton Peace Accord, is administered by two entities, the Federation of BiH (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (the RS), as well as a State level government.

Requests for other copies of the solicitation document will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted and no solicitation is available for pick-up.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces –Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of “improved quality of primary education,” with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are:  (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performanced based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $9m with an optional 4th year for an additional amount of $3m. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). This pre-solicitation notice can be viewed and downloaded using http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation, once issued, can be downloaded from the GPE.

<DESC>NA The Northern Region Contracting Center (NRCC), Installation Division - Fort Lee Branch located at Fort Lee (Prince George County), Virginia intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract for Architect and Engineer Services. The c ontract will be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  Interested firms must possess the capabilities, knowledge and resources to meet the unique and demanding requirements of the Regional Tidewater Directorates of Public Works (DPW) or Directorates of Engin eering and Logistics (DEL) supported by the NRCC - Fort Lee Branch. The DPW/DEL's consist of various military installations that include Fort Eustis, Fort Lee, Fort Monroe, Fort Pickett and Fort Story. The requirement will be for Architect - Engineer (A-E)  Services only and is not intended to function as a design-build contract. The following are examples of the types of services that have been previously completed and are anticipated under the proposed action: 1. Designs and/or Feasibility Studies of admin istrative, educational, industrial and warehouse facilities as well as barracks, army family housing and other existing facilities, 2. Various Designs/Studies utilizing disciplines such as Architectural, Mechanical, Structural, Civil, Land Surveying, Geo-t echnical (Soils Engineer), Environmental, and Electrical Engineers, as well as Estimating, Plumbing, Communication, Fire Protection and Energy Management Controls, 3. Design new and/or renovate existing facilities to accommodate various functions and use g roups, 4. Landscape design, 5. Master Planning documentation, 6. Installation design guides, 7. Marketing Brochures, 8. 1391 Preparation, 9. Design Charrette's and concept designs, 10. Construction Contract Administration (Quality Assurance (QA) Inspectors ), 11. Design renderings and presentations, 12. Virtual/Web based presentations, 13. Building condition Reports, 14. Rehabilitation of historic buildings and structures, 15. AutoCAD services, and 16. Environmental Surveys, Reports and Studies. The A-E firm  shall maintain a staff of licensed and registered Architects and Engineers.  The firm shall have the financial capabilities to successfully execute priorities; and handle workload surges of various scope and complexity for multiple Task Orders throughout the entire Tidewater Region. The government requests interested firms identify their interests and capabilities to meet the above requirements by submitting their Standard Forms (SF) 254 & 255. NOTE: If your firm previously submitted SF 254s and 255s and r esponded to the questions for the ASFI advertisement that closed on 1 May 03 it is not necessary for your firm to resubmit these documents in order to be considered eligible. The documents shall be submitted in hard copy format to the Northern Regional Con tract Center (NRCC), Installation Division - Fort Lee, ATTN: George Herndon, 1830 Quartermaster Road, Fort Lee, VA 23801-1606. Telephone (804) 734-4985 and email: herndong@lee.army.mil no later than (NLT) 2:00 P.M. local time, 1 Aug 03. In addition the fir ms shall answer the following questions: Unique capabilities of the A-E: Volume of Work: Due to the funding cycle of the Federal Government, the regional tidewater DPW/DEL's typically have the majority of their Operation & Maintenance Appropriation (OMA) d esigns (and construction) positioned and awarded during the 4th quarter (Jul-Sep) of the fiscal year. For example, of the over $1M average of design services prepared each fiscal year through the tidewater regional contract, over 70% of the Task Orders are  awarded during the 4th quarter, thereby making the start and completion dates for such projects running concurrently with each other. 1. Question: How would your firm intend to handle a workload surge of such magnitude (i.e. numerous projects at different  Installations) with start and completion dates all within the same time period? 2. Question: How does your firm intend to allocate/develop/ obtain the resource s required to execute approximately $1M of design work for multiple Installations at the same time? Responsiveness:   Often, the Tidewater Regional DPW/DEL's require immediate assistance that demands instant responsiveness by the A-E (i.e., same or next day) to mission critical directives that might include a scope development meeting, investigation of a facility, concept  design and cost estimate or some other action requiring A-E services. 3. Question: How would your firm respond to such an urgent request requiring immediate attention while maintaining ongoing project schedules? Please describe in detail how the Project M anagers, Architects and Engineers for on-going projects will be distributed to meet such requests. The Tidewater Regional A-E contract is a 3-year contract (1 Base Period + 2 Option Periods). Often, designs completed by the A-E are under construction while  the A-E contract is ongoing, other times after the completion of the contract period. 4. Question: How does your firm view A-E liability during construction? Does your firm view it as a continuation of the design process or as a separate functional elemen t of the Construction contract? 5. Question: How would your firm respond to differing site conditions and/or design deficiencies discovered during construction involving a design completed under the subject contract? 6. Question: What would be the process for corrective action? 7. Question: What are the processes in place for reviewing submittals during construction? Experience: The Tidewater Regional DEL's typically execute (for construction) the designs completed under A-E contracts through various means.  8. Question: What is your firms' experience with designing projects to be executed through: a. Job Order Contracting (JOC)? b. Corps of Engineers? c. Installation Contracting Offices?

STATEMENT OF WORK – FOR PURPOSES OF RESPONDING TO THIS REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ), THE CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE, PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, AND PRICE TO DEVELOP DRAWINGS AND A MOCKUP FORM LINER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SCOPE OF WORK.  The contract awarded as a result of this Request for Quotations will consist of Items (1) Preliminary Shop Drawings, (2) Final Drawings, and (3) MOCKUP Form Liners contained in the statement of work.  All work must be completed within 90 calendar days. QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE. The Contractor shall have a minimum of five (5) consecutive years work experience making custom form liners to create formed concrete surfaces to match natural stone shapes and surface textures.  Submit a list of three (3) recently completed installations (no more than five (5) years from present) that represent custom form liner development for a specialized project using simulated natural stonewalls with textured vertical surfaces.  Include the project date, name and location; project budget for the simulated natural stone portion of the textured concrete work performed by the Concrete Installer; and address and phone number of the owner or owner's representative with knowledge of the work performed.  This information will be used to evaluate past performance and the Contractor’s understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.  
Submit a minimum of three recent 8- by 10-inch (8” X 10”) color photographs of each installation stated above as evidence of the experience and ability to produce textured vertical surfaces with the use of form liners.  The photographs are to be taken at various distances (10 feet, 20 feet, and 50 feet) from the textured vertical surfaces to distinguish details and overall quality of the work.  The photographs will be used to evaluate the aesthetic appearance of the walls.  Provide a work plan and a proposed schedule for completing the work (Items 1, 2, and 3) within the required time.  This information will be used to evaluate the Contractor’s understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.  DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK - This work consists of creating a textured form liner for a special surface texture.  The design will be such that it replicates the existing dry stack walls in the town of Georgetown, Colorado.  The form liner will emulate the size, shape, texture, stone spacing, and chinking and overall appearance of these existing walls.  The form liner will be used on face wire-faced Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) and cast-in-place type retaining walls.  The chosen form liner pattern will be used as the standard MSE wall facing for a 22-mile roadway in Colorado.  It is estimated that 5 to 7 miles of the road will require the MSE wall to be faced with the form liner.  Form liner wall heights will range between 4 feet and 22 feet throughout the proposed MSE wall corridor.  FORM LINER REQUIREMENTS - The form liner panels shall simulate the natural stone masonry and texture of the existing dry stack retaining walls located in Georgetown, Colorado.  The form liner panels shall provide a variety of sizes of the natural stones as well as variance in the spacing of the stones.  Exercise care to eliminate nesting or bunching of similar sized stones.  This requires the smallest stone size to fall between the following ranges: 1 foot 6 inches by 1 foot 0 inches (1’ 6” X 1’ 0”) or 1 foot 0 inches by 2 feet 0 inches (1’ 0” X 2’ 0”).  Any stone below the smallest stone size listed above will be considered a chinking stone.  Chinking stones will not be more than 7% of the total pattern.  Stones with unique and visually identifying character that become apparent when reused in a wall panel or easily identifiable will not be allowed.  The individual stones in the form liner pattern shall have angular edges to maintain a realistic look of talus type stone, and have a variety of surface relief consisting of but not all inclusive to smoothness, roughness, dimples, cracks, undulations, etc.   Stones of maximum or minimum bulge shall not be bunched together, but shall be randomly placed throughout the retaining wall.  The bulge of individual stones shall be irregular to provide a variety in the texture of the entire surface.  Generally, the smallest jointing depth will be ½ inch to 2 ½ inches and width will be ¼ inch to 2 inches.  Any joints wider than 2 inches will require a chinking stone.  The form liner joint relief should vary;  should not be uniform.  The jointing plan of the individual stones will vary throughout the total patterning to give a variety of relief in the overall appearance of the natural stone pattern.  Form liner panels will abut to each other in the joint regions of the stone pattern when configuring the form liner panel layout.  No noticeable abutting lines, or pattern created by abutting lines, will be visually apparent on the finished wall.  All construction expansion and control joints will occur in the recess joint regions of the stone pattern with careful design of long horizontal stone lengths being avoided.  The arrangement of the form liner panels will provide a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition within 62 feet horizontally.  Vertically the appearance of the stone pattern is to have a maximum amount of variety and no two liners can be connected to each other.  No liners of like kind will be placed adjacent to each other.  DRAWINGS AND SUBMITTALS - Approval of custom designed, natural stone, special surface texture (form liner) will be AS FOLLOWS:  (1) PRELIMINARY SHOP DRAWINGS.   The Contractor shall submit five (5) sets of preliminary shop drawings to the COTR for review.   The preliminary shop drawings will be of simulated dry stacked stone pattern form liner panels based on the specifications stated in the scope of work.  Provide preliminary shop drawings on 24- by 36-inch (24” X 36”) sheets.  Reduced-size drawings will be required as necessary.  The preliminary shop drawings will include but not be limited to the following:  Plan view, elevation view, and details showing overall patterns of natural talus stones in the form liner; Individual form liner panel designs, patterns and gang panel layouts; Stone pattern descriptions, dimensions and sequencing of form liner sections; Representative drawings of form liner panel layouts for the retaining walls.  Representative drawings shall show: the retaining wall traffic face and actual height - the retaining wall backside - and the height of the tallest wall, showing stepped footings; The arrangement of form liner panels that provides a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition.  On the drawings, show representative views of completed form lined walls with each form liner panel outlined in a dark line, and completed form lined walls without each form liner panel outlined.  Critical features include but are not limited to irregularities in stone patterns such as rock clusters, rosettes, linear rocks, and mortar joints; Details showing typical cross sections of walls, joints, corners, step footings, stone bulge, stone size, working line, joint and bed depths, joint locations, and end, edge and other special conditions.  Allow the COTR three (3) weeks of review time per shop drawing submittal.  After each review of preliminary shop drawings, comments will be returned to the Contractor so the necessary changes can be made.  If drawings are returned for revision, correct and resubmit for approval.   Reviews will continue until the COTR approves the preliminary shop drawings.  (2) FINAL DRAWINGS.   Following approval of the preliminary shop drawings, the Contractor shall submit five (5) sets of final drawings to the COTR for approval. For all concrete surfaces receiving special surface texture (form liner), provide the types, quantities, widths, and lengths of form liner panels required for the job.  Show the location and spacing of joints.  Provide final drawings of all form liner patterns and gang panel layouts to the COTR for approval prior to form liner development. (3) MOCKUP FORM LINERS.  The Contractor shall fabricate one (1) mockup form liner for each panel approved in the final set of drawings.  During mockup form liner development, a representative from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) shall be present.  The approximate size of the mockup is 10 feet by 12 feet (10’ X 12’).  The FHWA representative shall be present as all fabricating of mockup form liner panels are prepared, and will inspect them at the manufacturer’s fabrication site, prior to casting final molds.  During the inspection of the mockup form liner panels, the Contractor will be prepared to make adjustments to the form liner pattern where imperfections are found by the FHWA representative.  If initial mockup panel(s) is found to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor will be required to construct additional mockup panel(s).  Additional reviews and inspections of the mockup form liner panels will be repeated until approved by COTR.  During the inspection of the mockup form liners, the following items will be considered critical for approval:  individual stone spacing, sizes and shapes; stone surface texture; stone bulge; stone patterning; joint size, width and depth.  This list of items is not all inclusive and additional items may be added as necessary.  Demonstrate all special applications of the form liner (joints, corners, step footings, etc.) that will be necessary during construction.  (4) MASTER FORM LINER PANELS.   The master form liner panels for the FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT shall be fabricated based on approved final drawings and mockup form liners.  The Contractor shall construct master form liner panels from approved mockup panels.  The following photos are available electronically in .jpg format at website:  www.cflhd.gov/procurement under tab “Current Solicitations” titled Form Liners .  Photo A is an example of a dry stacked wall taken in Georgetown, Colorado.  Photo B is a picture of the same dry staked wall.  The crosshatched area above shows types of rocks and rock groupings that SHOULD NOT be reproduced in the form liner pattern layouts.  These rock shapes and grouping delineated above are too distinct and eye catching and will allow an individual a way to pick out the repeating pattern of the form liner.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Integrated Product Team (IPT) under the Area Attack Program Office, AAC/YH, plans to issue a competitive solicitation within 60 days to modify the TMD Fuze (currently in production) to a Government Performance Specification.  The plan is for replacement of a mechanical timer with an electronic timer in the fuze for the Tactical Munition Dispenser (TMD) section of the SFW system due to reliability issues.  This effort was previously synopsized in the FedBizOps as Solicitation Number YHK-03-0001; however, the acquisition strategy has changed.  An Industry Day will be conducted on Eglin AFB on 3 April 2003 in building 1, conference room 204.  Directions shall be available upon request.  This will be a 1-day event including a preliminary Government presentation in the morning, followed by separate 90-minute, one-on-one sessions with each interested contractor.  The purpose of this event will be to disseminate Government intentions and expectations to potential contractors participating in a competitive, best value acquisition for a modification to the SFW TMD fuze.  It is requested that each contractor limit the number of Industry Day participants to no more than 5 individuals.  Accordingly, please submit your visitor request forms no later than 3 working days prior to commencement of Industry Day.  For contractual questions including submission of visitor requests and scheduling one-on-one sessions, please contact Lt Anita Skipper at anita.skipper@eglin.af.mil or call (850) 882-3416 ext. 3259.  The TMD fuze is currently manufactured in accordance with a Government Owned Technical Data Package by Alliant TechSystems, Janesville, WI, under contract to Textron Systems, Wilmington, MA, the SFW contractor.  In this competitive acquisition, the contractor must produce a modified fuze to be qualified and tested.  The modified fuze must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze.  This project is considered to be medium to high risk based on safety of flight and integration with existing components.  The modified fuze must meet the safety requirements contained in MIL-STD-1316E and be approved by the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).  The initial effort includes non-recurring production engineering required to modify the current fuze design to current electronic technology and produce and qualify the hardware.  Options will be included for production quantities.  The estimated contract cost for this initial effort is $2.1M with $35M in options through fiscal year 2012.  A firm fixed-price type contract is contemplated.  An export controlled Technical Data Package is available upon request and Government receipt of a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.  The DD Form 2345 is for export control certification from the Defense Logistics Center (DLSC), Battle Creek MI 49016-3412 (1-800-352-3572) in accordance with DODD 5230.25.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.  Additionally, it is not the Government’s intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.   No collect calls, or telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted.  Direct all requests for solicitation and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Lt Anita Skipper (850) 882-3416, extension 3259.  Technical questions may be addressed to Ken Yates  (850) 882-4871, ext 2170.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Department of Agriculture intends to award a contract on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Go Albert Inc., 80 Maiden Lane, Suite 901, New York, NY 10038 to provide the AMI for Domino, search engine software to work with DA Staff Action application. The COTS search engine will integrate into or interface with a Lotus Domino application on an IBM x370 Windows Platform.  The engine must have the capability to search meta data as well as full text documents stored in the Lotus Domino environment.  The mandatory formats are tiff, pdf, word-processing or spreadsheet formats, however the desire would be to have the capability to search any database or file format.  The current application provides a text version of tiff images through the use of an OCR engine.  The search must accommodate Fuzzy Search Technology that will accommodate contaminated data.  Contaminated data often results in "close to the same spelling" of words or characters strings.  Each occurrence of a successful location within a document or groups of documents should be identified easily and contain a snippet of surrounding text with the provision for the user to step through the documents using a "next find" button.  The engine should have the ability to rank the results of the search using criteria provided at time of search initiation to provide for most likely candidates being displayed first.  A "sounds like" for text and "pattern recognition" for a graphics document are examples of desirable user specified criteria.  Pattern matching technology is preferred as opposed to using wild card or exact string matching.  The desire is to have the search engine use standard Boolean operators.  Responses received within fifteen (15) days of this publication will be considered in determining whether or not to place this order on a sole source basis.

Advanced Measurement Technology Incorporated is the only producer of the Ortec OCTETE units that are 100 % compatible with existing alpha spectrometer data-handling algorithm system at NIST.  The NIST written data handling software was specifically written to be compatible with the output format from the OCTETE system.  Since establishing the NIST data handling process, data output formats from other alpha spectrometry systems manufacturers were studied and found non-compatible because other spectrometry systems will not allow full interchangeability of hardware and software components that NIST must have for continued operation.  *** Delivery is required to be F.O.B. Origin and is required within 60 days after receipt of order. *** The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price purchase order.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures a firm fixed price award to Mr. Thomas F. Rutherford, 11th Floor Menzies Building, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria 3800 Australia.  The purpose of the acquisition is to require technical expertise and support in the development of a dynamic economic general equilibrium model of the health care system using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) Mathematical Programming System for General Equilibrium (MPSGE) software.  Dr. Rutherford will: 1) assist the Office of the Actuary in developing the theoretical basis for the model, 2) assist in writing the computer code for the model, 3) assist in developing the benchmark database used to calibrate the model, and 4) provide detailed instruction on the use of GAMS/MPSGE and on the manipulation of the final health sector model. Dr. Thomas Rutherford’s technical expertise in public finance and computable general equilibrium modeling in support of long term health sector economic modeling work within the Office of the Actuary (OACT).  Dr. Rutherford is the developer of the software that OACT uses to build general equilibrium models, has substantial experience teaching general equilibrium modeling (he is an associate professor of economics at the University of Colorado), is the author of numerous articles related to applied general equilibrium modeling, and has conducted numerous studies of economic policies for the U.S. and foreign governments.  Dr. Rutherford is uniquely qualified to support OACT in its modeling work for four reasons.  First, he is the developer of MPSGE--the general equilibrium modeling program used by OACT--and is actively involved in upgrading and refining the software.  His knowledge of the programming language and its capabilities are unmatched. Second, a goal of the model development project is to ensure that CMS staff will be able to fully run and manipulate the final model.  To that end, Dr. Rutherford will be required to provide instruction in general equilibrium modeling and GAMS/MPSGE programming.  As an associate professor of economics at the University of Colorado, Dr. Rutherford has accumulated many years of teaching general equilibrium modeling including leading courses on GAMS/MPSGE programming.  Third, Dr. Rutherford has substantial experience in developing general equilibrium models for public and private sector applications.  He has conducted numerous analyses of economic policies including work performed for the U.S. and foreign governments, and has a lengthy resume of published research on a wide variety of economic issues. Finally, Dr. Rutherford’s area of expertise is in the field of public finance; that is, the study of how government tax and spending activity affects the economy.  This field is central to our modeling effort (which will examine the impacts of government social and medical care programs).  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a cost plus fixed fee contract for the nonrecurring engineering and flight test support associated with the integration of a new upgraded integrated avionics unit (UIAU) for the autopilot of the BQM-34 aerial target vehicle.  The UIAU will be identical to the UIAU being developed for the BQM-74E and BQM-74F aerial target vehicles.  Tasks will include identifying, developing, building & testing the modifications required to all current Navy variants of the BQM-34 target vehicle to allow the UIAU based autopilot to fly and otherwise control the BQM-34 air vehicle and its associated payloads using current Navy Target Command and Control Systems.  Ground and flight testing support of the BQM-34 UIAU equipped aerial target system at Pt. Mugu, CA will also be required.  Documentation will also be developed and delivered detailing the nonrecurring engineering effort and producing a system specification that can be used to retrofit existing BQM-34 target vehicles in the Naval inventory.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate the proposed modification on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Corporation, Rancho Bernardo, CA.  Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for the development of the new UIAU for the BQM-74 family of aerial target systems.  Only Northrop Grumman has the technical expertise, understanding of the system engineering, software architecture, and system integration required to take a common UIAU and integrate this common unit into a variety of aerial target systems, including the BQM-34.  These target systems (BQM-34 and BQM-74E/F) employ a wide range of technology dating from the 1970s to current state of the art.  This requires sophisticated and dedicated knowledge of these specific aerial target systems.  In addition much of the technical data required to perform this effort is Northrop Grumman proprietary data.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for SEMI support for the United Kingdom (UK).  This support shall be provided under the direction of PMA-280.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, providing summaries of Engineering assessments and trade studies which have potential impact to UK Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) Hardware, providing results summaries of TWS requirements analysis/tradeoffs on critical and other-than-critical technical performance parameters, providing system level performance requirements/ verification Traces on planned changes to the TWS, assess and define program risks to the UK TWS program resulting from changes to the existing TWS systems, and providing systems engineering support associated with the USN and FMS Tomahawk launch platform.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the TWS.  They possess the required knowledge and documentation necessary to assess impacts to external AUR and TWS interfaces.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

The proposed project is an extension of previous data collection and analyses performed by Dr. Judith Kildow formerly of the University of Vermont and Dr. Charles Cogan of the University of Southern Maine.  The previous data will be compared with the results of the newly acquired data.  The group is uniquely qualified to perform this work because of existing knowledge of the methodologies used to develop the existing NOEP information system as well as their access to proprietary data and other information necessary for the completion of the work.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by July 18, 2003.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

My apologies if they are misspelled. 2. LTC Westenhaver covered the elements of amendment 1. The solicitation is an Invitation for Bid (IFB) not a Request for Proposal (RFP) Davis Bacon, wage rates, will apply to this proposed contract On page 11 of the solicitation FAR clause 52.219 3 should be deleted 3. Page 3, item 4, Additive Bid Item 3 of the solicitation should make reference to Sheet A7 1A rather than Sheet A7 1. 4. Maj. Rick Oxner, the Base Civil Engineer for this project, conducted the rest of the meeting with assistance from the Cromwell representatives. Some of the topics covered were: It is critical that all standoff distances are maintained due to new force protection requirements (example: 82 feet from building to roads and parking lots) Job site is fairly flat so there is not much of a need for excavation other than for utilities. Additive Bid Item (ABI) 2 is remaining landscaping that is not covered in the Base Bid. All sod is in the Base Bid. Do not use square footage tables in the blue prints for your calculations for carpet. Drawings - A 1 3  2ft X 2ft dropped in ceiling and security mesh over mechanical A 3 2  Part of the roof trim will have to be painted to match the brick work on the front. A 6 5 Names will change on the plaque. All system furniture is to be provided and installed by the government. Wall lockers are to be provided and installed by the contractor. Pay particular attention to the transition, carpet to tile, strip under the doors. Do not air condition bathrooms. They only have radiant heat panels and vents. Underground electrical vaults should be covered with 6 inches of red concrete and then sand. Other elements of the plans, specifications and addendums 1 and 2 were covered and than a site visit was conducted. 5. Two very important components of this amendment are Addendums 1 and 2 which contain numerous changes. 6. Anyone that bought an original set of specifications and drawings from Cromwell Architects Engineers will automatically be sent a free copy of addendums 1 and 2 from Cromwell. Anyone not receiving their free copy by 8 July 2003 should contact Cromwell a t (501) 372-2900. All others wanting a copy of addendums 1 and 2 may also contact Cromwell. 7. Any technical questions regarding this project should be faxed to Major Rick Oxner at (501) 987 8463. Administrative questions should be faxed to LTC Randy Westenhaver at (501) 212 4419. 8. If you would like to view the proposed construction site send a written request to Major Rick Oxner at fax number (501) 987 8463.

<DESC>Due to budget constraints, the Government acquisition team was required to reassess the technical requirements of this solicitation.  This reassessment has caused the Government to delay the re-competition.  Due to this delay caused by the necessary changes in the requirements, the current contract had to be extended to ensure continuity of services.  The extension consisted of a two-month basic period with four one-month options.  The Government anticipates performance to begin on a new contract in the first quarter of FY 2004.  This solicitation's offer due date will be indicated in Block 8 of the SF1449 in Amendment 0002.  This Amendment will be posted within the next week.

Per the solicitation, Section 00100, a site visit has been scheduled for 11:00 AM on July 2, 2003 at the James T. Foley Courthouse in Albany, NY.  The agency will carefully consider the attendance of prospective HUBZone offerors as an indication of interest in this procurement.  The set-aside will be reevaluated should the contracting officer determine that the government is unlikely to receive bids from two or more HUBZone certified firms with average annual gross receipts not more than $12M .  Prospective offerors also are urged to carefully consider the allowable level of subcontracting for this procurement.  No more than 75% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel may be spent on employees from other than HUBZone small business concerns.  Please immediately direct any additional questions to the points of contact listed below in order that this procurement may proceed in an orderly and efficient manner.  The General Services Administration appreciates the interest already expressed and is committed to providing ample additional opportunity before altering the set-aside.

<DESC>The Pentagon Renovation Office is soliciting technical proposals for the Pentagon Officer’s Athletic Center (POAC) Conversion construction project. The project requires the design and construction conversion of an existing partially earth sheltered building of approximately 120,000 – 121,500 sf.  The facility currently houses a fitness center that will be converted into a resource center.  The resource center will include:  a conference center; an informal restaurant; a library and a police station. Scope of the project may include: demolition, abatement of asbestos, lead paint, and other hazardous material; soil fill (existing indoor swimming pool is below grade); waterproofing of the River Terrace; general repairs to the concrete exterior walls, replacement of a substantial part of the existing concrete slab-on-grade supported by new structure; tie into existing steam, chilled water, sanitary sewer, and electrical systems on site; and construction of a partial second floor.  The acquisition will be accomplished utilizing two-phase design-build selection procedures.  The Phase I solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about May 14, 2003.  Offers submitted in response to Phase I will be evaluated to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase II, which is anticipated to be released on or about July 13, 2003.  No hard copies of the solicitation or any amendments will be issued.  One contract will be awarded using best value competitive procedures.  The estimated cost range for this project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000.

<CONTACT>Doug McDaniel 812-854-5395
<DESC>This amendment is issued to include the following questions and answers: Q1 - Where are these ranges located?  A1 – Both ranges are located in Virginia, near one another.  Q2 - Does ADI currently operate the range?  If not who?  A2 - Range personnel operate the ranges.  Q3 - Are the ranges currently operational?  A3 – Yes.  Q4 - Is there a window of installation time that must be worked around to support current and future shots?  A4 – No.  Q5 - We also suppose that ADI (or one of its acquisitions) initially installed the LOMAH system.  True or not?  A5 – True.  Q6 - We understand that there may not be much documentation (controls upgrade projects are normally like that), but how would we get more information in order to make a bid?  A6 – If a formal procurement solicitation is issued, a site visit may be included before proposals are due.  Q7  - Is ADI bidding on the project?  If so they would probably have an advantage since they should know of more of the requirements.  A7 - ADI was bought out by Polytronic and they are probably interested.   Q8 - Do you have the specs of the mover rails, and series 6 & 10 mechanisms along with the Tbars and hit switches?  A8 – Prospective offerors would have to get specs on the site visit.  Q9 - What the environmental conditions for computing systems?  Are there any existing enclosures that are to be used?  A9 – The ranges are located approximately one block from the ocean.  Q10 - The User interface terminals with printers, we suppose they are open except for a cover, true or not?  A10 – True.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Columbia River Fisheries Program Office, desires to purchase a Fish Tagging unit and injector that go with the Northwest Marine Technology decimal coded wire tags.    The FWS is needing one (4)  automatic tagging unit and one (1)  tagging injector.   The Mark IV automatic tag injector handles millions of cycles of tag injections.  The tags some in continuous wire form on a spool, are automatically cut off, magnetized and injected through a hollow needle.  The operator then verifies that the specimen contains a magnetic tag by dropping the specimen through a Quality Control device where it flows through a tag detection tunnel.  The injector is about 18 pounds in wieght, 10 inches wide, 10 inches high and 12 inches deep.  The injector is easily programmed from the keyboard and can mark 600 to 800 fish per hour.  The injector can be used with either a head mold or a needle support tube. The decimal coded wire tags consist of stainless steel wire (1mm x 0.25mm) etched with numbers to allow identifications of batches or individuals of fish.  For further information, please contact Elida Monroe at 503-231-2052.

<DESC>NA DACA41-03-R-0013 (Previously DACA41-02-R-0009) This is the second sources sought synopsis to identify parties interested in, and capable of, entering into a planned contract for the privatization of Domestic Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Riley, Kansas. If you responded to the first sourc es sought, you will have to respond again to this new one. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by re-regerstering. By responding to this announcement, you will automatically be included in the plan holders list for the solicitation, when it is releas ed later this year (September 2003). Privatization involves the transfer of the ownership, operation, maintenance and upgrade of Army owned utility systems to the non-Federal sector (including municipals, cooperatives, and regional authorities, as well as private entities). The Army may award one or more 50-year utility service contracts to service providers whose response to a planned Request for Proposal (RFP) best meets the needs of the Government. A Presolicitation Announcement, on or about 01 Aug 2003,  will explain in more detail the scope of work and evaluation factors to be used in the selection process.  ---SPECIAL NOTE---  Interested parties should note that currently under construction is a new 2.35 million gallons per day (MGD) Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. This plant will replace three trickling filter treatment plants. The new facilities will collect raw wastewate r that is currently treated at three plants and provide advanced treatment at the new treatment plant located on Custer Hill. Domestic wastewater will be collected from sources around the post and conveyed through the gravity collection system to a series of pump stations that will pump the wastewater to the Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. The project includes the demolition of two existing wastewater treatment plants, the construction of two new major lift stations, and the rebuilding of one smaller l ift station. The Government will retain ownership of all new construction associated with this project through the completion of the warranty period, one year after construction completion. A contract awarded for the ownership of the wastewater distributio n system will not include the new construction. The successful new owner will operate and maintain the new treatment plant and associated construction during the warranty period. Following the warranty period, the final construction cost will be determined  and the utility distribution system contract will be modified to turn over the new construction and delete any demolished system facilities, with a cost based on the final construction cost. Interested parties capable of providing this service are invited to register on-line at  http://nwk-ebs.nwk.usace.army.mil/ebs/advertisedsolicitations.asp .  ---TENTATIVE SCHEDULE---  The Pre-Solicitation Announcement for this acquisition will be issued on or about 01 Aug 2003. The Solicitation itself will be issued on or about 15 Sep 2003. A Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit will be scheduled on or about 07-08 October 2003. The te ntative due date for receipt of proposals will be on or about 15 Dec 2003.  Point of Contact for administrative questions and clarifications is Contract Specialist Perry D.

<DESC>This Request for Information Sources Sought Notice is also listed at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil.

The United States Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), PM Tank Systems and PM AAVS are interested in receiving information on non-developmental battlefield management systems having potential to be integrated into a U.S. Marine Corps M1A1 Common Main Battle Tank and Amphibious Assault Vehicle Communications variant (AAVC7).

MARCORSYSCOM, PM Tank Systems and PM AAVS are interested in enhancing the combat overmatch and situational awareness capabilities of its M1A1 and AAV fleets through a provision for synergistic informational dominance. Informational dominance to maneuver commanders and leaders is gained through their possession of a common, relevant, scaled battle-space picture. Situational awareness across the entire spectrum of tactical operations can be allowed for through the instantaneous dissemination and improved ability to relate a relevant common picture during any operation. This capability is a critical enabler to an armored system's ability to dominate against a wide range of threats in any combat environment now and well into the future.  Interoperability with Joint Situational Awareness and Fire Control Systems is and will continue to be a key performance parameter.

This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought will serve as the first step to identify potential applications to the M1A1 and AAV fleets and its envisioned future replacement systems. Therefore, it is also desired that they possess an appropriate level of developmental maturity and growth potential for possible technological transition in support of future combat vehicles.  PM Tank Systems and PM AAVS may potentially hold a full and open competition in the near future to evaluate one or more potential systems on an M1A1 and AAV.

Proposed systems should include a combination of non-developmental software and hardware components already configured for military applications with planned developmental enhancements and growth potential.  Planned developmental enhancements may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology.  

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Marine Corps to procure subject systems. The Government is only seeking possible sources for potential future needs.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Information may be submitted any time during the above stated period.  There is no specific format or outline for providing such vendor information.  However, it is requested that interested sources provide sufficient descriptive literature and other pertinent information to provide the fullest understanding of the system capabilities. No telephonic responses, please.

The Government is not liable for any costs associated with the submittal of such vendor information.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Acquisition and Grants Group is seeking capability statements from small and minority business firms who are qualified to contract for design, data collection, and perform data preparation. The intent of this publication/announcement/solicitation is to reach and encourage as many small and minority business firms as possible to compete for CMS?s current programs.  CMS needs comprehensive and timely information on the health care use, costs, and characteristics of its Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, this survey measures health care utilization, expenditures, insurance coverage and associated variables in a representative sample of the persons served by the Medicare program.  This effort is pursuant to the fourth Functional Statement for the Office, published in the Federal Register (Vol. 62, No.85,p.24121-2, May 2, 1997):  Small and minority businesses are invited to submit capability statements electronically to Jbarnes2@cms.hhs.gov or by mail to: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services AGG/Division of Research Contracts and Grants 2-21-15 Central Building, 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD  21244-1850.  Qualified firms should have expertise in at least some of the following specific data analysis areas listed below.  These activities require that the contractor must have, or must be able to acquire under the terms and conditions of its contractual agreement, the resources and expertise to perform these functions on an almost immediate basis.  This role will require designs and conduct research and evaluations of health care programs, studying their impacts on beneficiaries, providers, plans, States, and other partners and customers, designing and assessing potential improvements, and developing new measurement tools. This role will also require environmental scanning, identifying, evaluating, and reporting emerging trends in health care delivery and financing and their interactions with Agency programs.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to contract for design, data collection, and data preparation to continue the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a multi-year survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare Beneficiaries.  Interviews for the MCBS have been conducted three times a year since 1991, using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technology.   Data will be validated and weighted to produce national and regional estimates and to serve as a research database.  Quick turnaround of high quality data will be emphasized for use in formulating national policy. This is not a formal solicitation.  Concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above. Sources possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the above are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished should include background information, resumes, a description of general and specific facilities, and an outline of previous similar projects, and other available literature for the CMS to perform a proper evaluation.  Interested small businesses may submit these tailored capability statements to the attention of the Contract Specialist at the address above no later than 10 calendar days from date of this publication.

<SUBJECT>D -- Upgrade to existing JACK software package
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE – The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH) has a requirement to: 1)  upgrade our unsupported copy of JACK software package to the latest release available and 2) obtain the occupant packaging toolkit.  Our current version is UNIX based and only runs on outdated unsupported SGI computers.  The latest release of JACK is PC based and is compatible with Windows NT and 2000 operating systems.  The software will be used to study harness fit to various body shapes and farm tractor cab accommodation to tractor operators.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company’s overall financial status. Items being considered are: Pressboard Classification Folders 7930-00-NIB-0672 Legal Size - 1 Divier/4 Part Light Blue; 7930-00-NIB-0673 Legal Size - 1 Divider/4 Part Red; 7930-00-NIB-0674 Legal Size - 1 Divider/4 Part Dark Blue; 7930-00-NIB-0675 Legal Size 1 Divider/4 Part Green; 7930-00-NIB-0676 - 1 Divider/4 Part Yellow; 7930-00-NIB-0679 - Letter Size - 2 Divider/6 Part - Gray/Green).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

STATEMENT OF WORK – FOR PURPOSES OF RESPONDING TO THIS REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ), THE CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE, PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, AND PRICE TO DEVELOP DRAWINGS AND A MOCKUP FORM LINER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SCOPE OF WORK.  The contract awarded as a result of this Request for Quotations will consist of Items (1) Preliminary Shop Drawings, (2) Final Drawings, and (3) MOCKUP Form Liners contained in the statement of work.  All work must be completed within 90 calendar days. QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE, AND PAST PERFORMANCE. The Contractor shall have a minimum of five (5) consecutive years work experience making custom form liners to create formed concrete surfaces to match natural stone shapes and surface textures.  Submit a list of three (3) recently completed installations (no more than five (5) years from present) that represent custom form liner development for a specialized project using simulated natural stonewalls with textured vertical surfaces.  Include the project date, name and location; project budget for the simulated natural stone portion of the textured concrete work performed by the Concrete Installer; and address and phone number of the owner or owner's representative with knowledge of the work performed.  This information will be used to evaluate past performance and the Contractor’s understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.  
Submit a minimum of three recent 8- by 10-inch (8” X 10”) color photographs of each installation stated above as evidence of the experience and ability to produce textured vertical surfaces with the use of form liners.  The photographs are to be taken at various distances (10 feet, 20 feet, and 50 feet) from the textured vertical surfaces to distinguish details and overall quality of the work.  The photographs will be used to evaluate the aesthetic appearance of the walls.  Provide a work plan and a proposed schedule for completing the work (Items 1, 2, and 3) within the required time.  This information will be used to evaluate the Contractor’s understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.  DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK - This work consists of creating a textured form liner for a special surface texture.  The design will be such that it replicates the existing dry stack walls in the town of Georgetown, Colorado.  The form liner will emulate the size, shape, texture, stone spacing, and chinking and overall appearance of these existing walls.  The form liner will be used on face wire-faced Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) and cast-in-place type retaining walls.  The chosen form liner pattern will be used as the standard MSE wall facing for a 22-mile roadway in Colorado.  It is estimated that 5 to 7 miles of the road will require the MSE wall to be faced with the form liner.  Form liner wall heights will range between 4 feet and 22 feet throughout the proposed MSE wall corridor.  FORM LINER REQUIREMENTS - The form liner panels shall simulate the natural stone masonry and texture of the existing dry stack retaining walls located in Georgetown, Colorado.  The form liner panels shall provide a variety of sizes of the natural stones as well as variance in the spacing of the stones.  Exercise care to eliminate nesting or bunching of similar sized stones.  This requires the smallest stone size to fall between the following ranges: 1 foot 6 inches by 1 foot 0 inches (1’ 6” X 1’ 0”) or 1 foot 0 inches by 2 feet 0 inches (1’ 0” X 2’ 0”).  Any stone below the smallest stone size listed above will be considered a chinking stone.  Chinking stones will not be more than 7% of the total pattern.  Stones with unique and visually identifying character that become apparent when reused in a wall panel or easily identifiable will not be allowed.  The individual stones in the form liner pattern shall have angular edges to maintain a realistic look of talus type stone, and have a variety of surface relief consisting of but not all inclusive to smoothness, roughness, dimples, cracks, undulations, etc.   Stones of maximum or minimum bulge shall not be bunched together, but shall be randomly placed throughout the retaining wall.  The bulge of individual stones shall be irregular to provide a variety in the texture of the entire surface.  Generally, the smallest jointing depth will be ½ inch to 2 ½ inches and width will be ¼ inch to 2 inches.  Any joints wider than 2 inches will require a chinking stone.  The form liner joint relief should vary;  should not be uniform.  The jointing plan of the individual stones will vary throughout the total patterning to give a variety of relief in the overall appearance of the natural stone pattern.  Form liner panels will abut to each other in the joint regions of the stone pattern when configuring the form liner panel layout.  No noticeable abutting lines, or pattern created by abutting lines, will be visually apparent on the finished wall.  All construction expansion and control joints will occur in the recess joint regions of the stone pattern with careful design of long horizontal stone lengths being avoided.  The arrangement of the form liner panels will provide a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition within 62 feet horizontally.  Vertically the appearance of the stone pattern is to have a maximum amount of variety and no two liners can be connected to each other.  No liners of like kind will be placed adjacent to each other.  DRAWINGS AND SUBMITTALS - Approval of custom designed, natural stone, special surface texture (form liner) will be AS FOLLOWS:  (1) PRELIMINARY SHOP DRAWINGS.   The Contractor shall submit five (5) sets of preliminary shop drawings to the COTR for review.   The preliminary shop drawings will be of simulated dry stacked stone pattern form liner panels based on the specifications stated in the scope of work.  Provide preliminary shop drawings on 24- by 36-inch (24” X 36”) sheets.  Reduced-size drawings will be required as necessary.  The preliminary shop drawings will include but not be limited to the following:  Plan view, elevation view, and details showing overall patterns of natural talus stones in the form liner; Individual form liner panel designs, patterns and gang panel layouts; Stone pattern descriptions, dimensions and sequencing of form liner sections; Representative drawings of form liner panel layouts for the retaining walls.  Representative drawings shall show: the retaining wall traffic face and actual height - the retaining wall backside - and the height of the tallest wall, showing stepped footings; The arrangement of form liner panels that provides a continuous stone pattern without visual disruption or repetition.  On the drawings, show representative views of completed form lined walls with each form liner panel outlined in a dark line, and completed form lined walls without each form liner panel outlined.  Critical features include but are not limited to irregularities in stone patterns such as rock clusters, rosettes, linear rocks, and mortar joints; Details showing typical cross sections of walls, joints, corners, step footings, stone bulge, stone size, working line, joint and bed depths, joint locations, and end, edge and other special conditions.  Allow the COTR three (3) weeks of review time per shop drawing submittal.  After each review of preliminary shop drawings, comments will be returned to the Contractor so the necessary changes can be made.  If drawings are returned for revision, correct and resubmit for approval.   Reviews will continue until the COTR approves the preliminary shop drawings.  (2) FINAL DRAWINGS.   Following approval of the preliminary shop drawings, the Contractor shall submit five (5) sets of final drawings to the COTR for approval. For all concrete surfaces receiving special surface texture (form liner), provide the types, quantities, widths, and lengths of form liner panels required for the job.  Show the location and spacing of joints.  Provide final drawings of all form liner patterns and gang panel layouts to the COTR for approval prior to form liner development. (3) MOCKUP FORM LINERS.  The Contractor shall fabricate one (1) mockup form liner for each panel approved in the final set of drawings.  During mockup form liner development, a representative from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) shall be present.  The approximate size of the mockup is 10 feet by 12 feet (10’ X 12’).  The FHWA representative shall be present as all fabricating of mockup form liner panels are prepared, and will inspect them at the manufacturer’s fabrication site, prior to casting final molds.  During the inspection of the mockup form liner panels, the Contractor will be prepared to make adjustments to the form liner pattern where imperfections are found by the FHWA representative.  If initial mockup panel(s) is found to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor will be required to construct additional mockup panel(s).  Additional reviews and inspections of the mockup form liner panels will be repeated until approved by COTR.  During the inspection of the mockup form liners, the following items will be considered critical for approval:  individual stone spacing, sizes and shapes; stone surface texture; stone bulge; stone patterning; joint size, width and depth.  This list of items is not all inclusive and additional items may be added as necessary.  Demonstrate all special applications of the form liner (joints, corners, step footings, etc.) that will be necessary during construction.  (4) MASTER FORM LINER PANELS.   The master form liner panels for the FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT shall be fabricated based on approved final drawings and mockup form liners.  The Contractor shall construct master form liner panels from approved mockup panels.  The following photos are available electronically in .jpg format at website:  www.cflhd.gov/procurement under tab “Current Solicitations” titled Form Liners .  Photo A is an example of a dry stacked wall taken in Georgetown, Colorado.  Photo B is a picture of the same dry staked wall.  The crosshatched area above shows types of rocks and rock groupings that SHOULD NOT be reproduced in the form liner pattern layouts.
